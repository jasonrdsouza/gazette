I despise WP (who doesn&#8217;t?), and there&#8217;s so much friction in getting a post out that I just don&#8217;t do it. Plus, it&#8217;s clear that to the extent that there is a vibrant ecosystem of tech writers in longform, it&#8217;s on substack. I miss tech twitter, always will. Time to give substack a try.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been working on the second edition of &#8220;Observability Engineering&#8221; for much of this year, and I have learned SO MUCH in the writing process. As soon as these rough drafts have all been turned in, I will be streaming my thoughts out via substack. They are burning a hole in my brain the longer I hold them in.</p>\n<p>Housekeeping notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I&#8217;ve tried to export the email subscribers and import them into substack, but it&#8217;s held up for manual review. I don&#8217;t know what that means.</li>\n<li>I won&#8217;t be able to export and bring along the comments you folks have left over the years. I&#8217;m sorry. \ud83d\ude41</li>\n<li>I am going to leave charity.wtf pointed here for the foreseeable future, even tho I am working to port over the corpus of posts. I don&#8217;t want to break anyone&#8217;s bookmarks or article links, so I&#8217;ll leave it up here until / unless I find a solution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to go subscribe, I&#8217;m at charitydotwtf.substack.com. Here&#8217;s the blurb:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thank you all for a wonderful 10 years together. WordPress may be a piece of shit, but the community I&#8217;ve found here has been anything but. I hope to see you on the other side.</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9b\ud83e\udde1\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc96</p>\n<p>charity</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

It's a very interesting piece of software, both as a useful library and as a case study in sophisticated AI-assisted programming.</p> <h4 id=\"first-impressions-of-justhtml\">First impressions of JustHTML</h4> <p>I didn't initially know that JustHTML had been written with AI assistance at all. The README caught my eye due to some attractive characteristics:</p> <ul> <li>It's pure Python. I like libraries that are pure Python (no C extensions or similar) because it makes them easy to use in less conventional Python environments, including Pyodide.</li> <li>\"Passes all 9,200+ tests in the official <a href=\"https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests\">html5lib-tests</a> suite (used by browser vendors)\" - this instantly caught my attention! HTML5 is a big, complicated but meticulously written specification.</li> <li>100% test coverage. That's not something you see every day.</li> <li>CSS selector queries as a feature. I built a Python library for this <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/soupselect\">many years ago</a> and I'm always interested in seeing new implementations of that pattern.</li> <li>html5lib has been <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/bleach/issues/698\">inconsistently maintained</a> over the last few years, leaving me interested in potential alternatives.</li> <li>It's only 3,000 lines of implementation code (and another ~11,000 of tests.)</li> </ul> <p>I was out and about without",
