                "<p>Groan. Well, it\u2019s not like I wasn\u2019t warned. When I first started teasing out the differences between the pillars model and the single unified storage model and applying \u201c2.0\u201d to the latter, Christine was like \u201cso what is going to stop the next vendor from slapping 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 on whatever they\u2019re doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Matt Klein dropped a new blog post last week called \u201c<a href=\"https://blog.bitdrift.io/post/observability-3-0\">Observability 3.0</a>\u201d, in which he argues that bitdrift&#8217;s Capture \u2014 a ring buffer storage on mobile devices \u2014 deserves that title. This builds on his previous blog posts: \u201c<a href=\"https://blog.bitdrift.io/post/1000-x-the-telemetry\">1000x the telemetry at 0.01x the cost</a>\u201d, \u201c<a href=\"https://blog.bitdrift.io/post/observability-cost-crisis\">Why is observability so expensive</a>?\u201d, and \u201c<a href=\"https://blog.bitdrift.dev/post/reality-check-otel\">Reality check: Open Telemetry is not going to solve your observability woes</a>\u201d, wherein he argues that the model of sending your telemetry to a remote aggregator is fundamentally flawed.</p>\n<p>I love Matt Klein\u2019s writing \u2014 it\u2019s opinionated, passionate, and deeply technical. It\u2019s a joy to read, full of fun, fiery statements about the \u201clogging industrial complex\u201d and backhanded&#8230; let&#8217;s call them &#8220;compliments&#8221;&#8230; about companies like ours. I\u2019m a fan, truly.</p>\n<h2>In retrospect, I semi regret the \u201co11y 2.0\u201d framing</h2>\n<p>Yeah, it\u2019s cheap and terribly overdone to use semantic versioning as a marketing technique. (It worked for Tim O\u2019Reilly with \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d, but Tim O\u2019Reilly is Tim O\u2019Reilly \u2014 the exception that proves the rule.) But that\u2019s not actually why I regret it.</p>\n<p>I regret it because a bunch of people \u2014 vendors mostly, but not entirely \u2014 got really bristly about having \u201c1.0\u201d retroactively applied to describe the multiple pillars model. It reads like a subtle diss, or devaluation of their tools.<img alt=\"Unstructured Logs Go Here (Trash)\" class=\"alignright wp-image-9540\" height=\"221\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/newpix-8.jpeg?resize=253%2C221&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"253\" /></p>\n<p>One of the principles I live my life by is that you should generally call people, or groups of people, what they want to be called.</p>\n<p>That is why, moving forwards, I am going to mostly avoid referring to the multiple pillars model as \u201co11y 1.0\u201d, and instead I will call it the \u2026 multiple pillars model. And I will refer to the unified storage model as the \u201cunified or consolidated storage model, sometimes called \u2018o11y 2.0\u2019\u201d.</p>\n<p>(For reference, I&#8217;ve previously written about <a href=\"https://charity.wtf/2024/08/07/is-it-time-to-version-observability-signs-point-to-yes/\">why it&#8217;s time to version observability</a>, what <a href=\"https://charity.wtf/2024/11/19/there-is-only-one-key-difference-between-observability-1-0-and-2-0/\">the key difference is between o11y 1.0 vs 2.0</a>, and had a fun volley back and forth with Hazel Weakly on versioning observabilities: <a href=\"https://charity.wtf/2024/12/20/on-versioning-observabilities-1-0-2-0-3-0-10-0/\">mine</a>, <a href=\"https://hazelweakly.me/blog/the-future-of-observability-observability-3-0/\">hers</a>.)</p>\n<h2>Why do we need new language?</h2>\n<p>It is clearer than ever that a sea change is underway when it comes to how telemetry gets collected and stored. Here is my evidence (if you have evidence to the contrary or would like to challenge me on this, please reach out \u2014 first name at honeycomb dot io, email me!!):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every single observability startup that was founded <em>before</em> 2021, that still exists, was built using the <strong>multiple pillars model</strong> \u2026 storing each type of signal in a different location, with limited correlation ability across data sets. (With one exception: <a href=\"http://honeycomb.io\">Honeycomb</a>.)</li>\n<li>Every single observability startup that was founded <em>after</em> 2021, that still exists, was built using the <strong>unified storage model</strong>, capturing wide, structured log events, stored in a columnar database. (With one exception: <a href=\"http://chronosphere.io\">Chronosphere</a>.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The major cost drivers in an o11y 1.0 \u2014 oop, sorry, in a \u201cmultiple pillars\u201d world, are 1) the number of tools you use, 2) cardinality of your data, and 3) dimensionality of your data \u2014 or in other words, the amount of context and detail you store about your data, which is the most valuable part of the data! You get locked in a zero sum game between cost and value.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"containers, because the dumpsters could no longer contain the fires\" class=\" wp-image-9546 alignleft\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/newpix-2.jpeg?resize=133%2C200&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"133\" />The major cost drivers in a unified storage world, aka \u201co11y 2.0\u201d, are 1) your traffic, 2) your architecture, and 3) density of your instrumentation. This is important, because it means your cost growth should roughly align with the growth of your business and the value you get out of your telemetry.</p>\n<p>This is a pretty huge shift in the way we think about instrumentation of services and levers of cost control, with a lot of downstream implications. If we just say \u201ceverything is observability\u201d, it robs engineers of the language they need to make smart decisions about instrumentation, telemetry and tools choices. Language informs thinking and vice versa, and when our cognitive model changes, we need language to follow suit.</p>\n<p>(Technically, we started out by defining observability as differentiated from monitoring, but the market has decided that everything is observability, so &#8230; we need to find new language, again. <img alt=\"\ud83d\ude09\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" />)</p>\n<h2>Can we just \u2026 <em>not</em> send all that data?</h2>\n<p>My favorite of Matt\u2019s blog posts is \u201c<a href=\"https://blog.bitdrift.io/post/observability-cost-crisis\">Why is observability so expensive</a>?\u201d wherein he recaps the last 30 years of telemetry, gives some context about his work with Envoy and the separation of control planes / data planes, all leading up to this fiery proposition:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\u201cWhat if by default we never send any telemetry at all?\u201d</p>\n<p>As someone who is always rooting for the contrarian underdog, I salute this. <img alt=\"\ud83e\udee1\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1fae1.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>As someone who has written and operated a ghastly amount of production services, I am not so sure.<img alt=\"My life was full of known-unknowns until you came into it\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-9699\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/stickers-27.jpeg?resize=300%2C185&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"300\" /></p>\n<p>Matt is the cofounder and CTO of Bitdrift, a startup for mobile observability. And in the context of mobile devices and IoT, I think it makes a lot of sense to gather all the data and store it at the origin, and only forward along summary statistics, until or unless that data is requested in fine granularity. Using the ring buffer is a stroke of genius.</p>\n<p>Mobile devices are strictly isolated from each other, they are not competing with each other for shared resources, and the debugging model is mostly offline and ad hoc. It happens whenever the mobile developer decides to dig in and start exploring.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s less clear to me that this model will ever serve us well in the environment of highly concurrent, massively multi-tenant services, where two of the most important questions are always what is happening right now, and what just changed?</p>\n<p>Even the 60-second aggregation window for traditional metrics collectors is a painful amount of lag when the site is down. I can\u2019t imagine waiting to pull all the data in from hundreds or thousands of remote devices just to answer a question. And taking service isolation to such an extreme effectively makes traces impossible.</p>\n<h2>The hunger for more cost control levers is real</h2>\n<p>I think there\u2019s a kernel of truth there, which is that the desire to keep a ton of rich telemetry detail about a fast-expanding footprint of data in a central location is not ultimately compatible with what people are willing or able to pay.<img alt=\"Slow is the new down\" class=\"wp-image-9544 alignleft\" height=\"229\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/newpix-4.jpeg?resize=171%2C229&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"171\" /></p>\n<p>The fatal flaw of the multiple pillars model is that your levers of control consist of deleting your most valuable data: context and detail. The unified storage (o11y 2.0) model advances the state of the art by giving you tools that let you delete your LEAST valuable data, via tail sampling.</p>\n<p>In a unified storage model, you should also have to store your data only once, instead of once per tool (Gartner data shows that most of their clients are using 10-20 tools, which is a hell of a cost multiplier.)</p>\n<p>But I also think Matt\u2019s right to say that these are only incremental improvements. And the cost levers I see emerging in the market that I\u2019m most excited about are model agnostic.</p>\n<h2>Telemetry pipelines, tiered storage, data governance</h2>\n<p>The o11y 2.0 model (with no aggregation, no time bucketing, no indexing jobs) allows teams to get their telemetry faster than ever\u2026 but it does this by pushing all aggregation decisions from write time to read time. Instead of making a bunch of decisions at the instrumentation level about how to aggregate and organize your data\u2026 you store raw, wide structured event data, and perform ad hoc aggregations at query time.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Test in prod or make your users do it for you\" class=\"alignright  wp-image-9706\" height=\"209\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/stickers-20.jpeg?resize=170%2C209&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"170\" />Many engineers have argued that this is cost-prohibitive and unsustainable in the long run, and\u2026I think they are probably right. Which is why I am so excited about telemetry pipelines.</p>\n<p>Telemetry pipelines are the slider between aggregating metrics at write time (fast, cheap, painfully limited) and shipping all your raw, rich telemetry data off to a vendor, for aggregating at read time.</p>\n<p>Sampling, too, has come a long way from its clumsy, kludgey origins. Tail-based sampling is now the norm, where you make decisions about what to retain or not only after the request has completed. The combination of fine-grained sampling + telemetry pipelines + AI is <em>incredibly</em> promising.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not going to keep going into detail here because I\u2019m currently editing down a massive piece on levers of cost control, and I don\u2019t want to duplicate all that work (or piss off my editors). Suffice it to say, there\u2019s a lot of truth to what Matt writes\u2026 and also he has a way of skipping over all the details that would complicate or contradict his core thesis, in a way I don\u2019t love. This has made me vow to be more careful in how I represent other vendors\u2019 offerings and beliefs.</p>\n<h2>Money is not always the most expensive resource</h2>\n<p>I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get to \u201c<a href=\"https://blog.bitdrift.io/post/1000-x-the-telemetry\">1000x the telemetry at 0.01x the cost</a>\u201d, as Matt put it, unless we are willing to sacrifice or seriously compromise some of the other things we hold dear, like the ability to debug complex systems in real time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/705166/1576691\">Gartner recently put out a webinar</a> on controlling observability costs, which I very much appreciated, because it brought some real data to what has been a terribly vibes-based conversation. They pointed out that one of the biggest drivers of o11y costs has been that people get attached to it, and start using it heavily. You can\u2019t claw it back.<img alt=\"if it hurts...do it more\" class=\" wp-image-9708 alignleft\" height=\"95\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/stickers-18.jpeg?resize=230%2C95&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"230\" /></p>\n<p>I think this is a good thing \u2014 a long overdue grappling with the complexity of our systems and the fact that we need to observe it through our tools, not through our mental map or how we remember it looking or behaving, because it is constantly changing out from under us.</p>\n<p>I think observability engineering teams are increasingly looking less like ops teams, and more like data governance teams, the purest embodiment of platform engineering goals.</p>\n<p>When it comes to developer tooling, cost matters, but it is rarely the most important thing or the most valuable thing. The most important things are workflows and cognitive carrying costs.</p>\n<h2>Observability is moving towards a data lake model</h2>\n<p>Whatever you want to call it, whatever numeric label you want to slap on it, I think the industry is clearly moving in the direction of unified storage \u2014 a data lake, if you will, where signals are connected to each other, and particular use cases are mostly derived at read time instead of write time. Where you pay to store each request only one time, and there are no dead ends between signals.</p>\n<p>Matt wrote another post about how OpenTelemetry wasn\u2019t going to solve the cost crisis in<img alt=\"otel me again why i should instrument my code\" class=\"alignright wp-image-9541\" height=\"109\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/newpix-7.jpeg?resize=222%2C109&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"222\" /> o11y \u2026 but I think that misses the purpose of OTel. The point of OTel is to get rid of vendor lock-in, to make it so that o11y vendors compete for your business based on being awesome, instead of impossible to get rid of.</p>\n<p>Getting everyone\u2019s data into a structured, predictable format also opens up lots of possibilities for tooling to feel like \u201cmagic\u201d, which is exciting. And opens some entirely different avenues for cost controls!</p>\n<p>In my head, the longer term goals for observability involve unifying not just data for engineering, but for product analytics, business forecasting, marketing segmentation\u2026 There\u2019s so much waste going on all over the org by storing these in siloed locations. It fragments people\u2019s view of the world and reality. As much as I snarked on it at the time, I think Hazel Weakly\u2019s piece on \u201c<a href=\"https://hazelweakly.me/blog/the-future-of-observability-observability-3-0/\">The future of observability is observability 3.0</a>\u201d was incredibly on target.</p>\n<p>One of my guiding principles is that <img alt=\"\u2728\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2728.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /><strong>data is made valuable by context</strong>.<img alt=\"\u2728\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2728.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /> When you store it densely packed together \u2014 systems, app, product, marketing, sales \u2014 and derive insights from a single source of truth, how much faster might we move? How much value might we unlock?</p>\n<p>I think the new few years are going to be pretty exciting.</p>"

I needed to know what parts of the American Dream we all still had in common. I had to make some sense of what was happening to our country. I&#x2019;ve been writing on my blog since 2004, and on November 7th, I started writing the most difficult piece I have ever written. </p><p>I asked so many Americans to tell me what the American Dream personally meant to them, and I wrote it all down.</p><p>Later in November, I attended a theater performance of The Outsiders at my son&#x2019;s public high school - an adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1742507328643679&amp;usg=AOvVaw2GgwTbUV3qWhPvsHuYFgy7\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the 1967 novel by S.E.

The dream is incomplete until we share it with our fellow Americans. That act of sharing is the final realization of everything the dream stands for.</p><p>Thanks to S.E. Hinton, I finally had a name for my essay, <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/stay-gold-america/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">&#x201c;Stay Gold, America.&#x201d;</a> I published it on January 7th, with a <strong>Pledge to Share the American Dream</strong>.</p><p>In the first part of the Pledge, the short term, our family made eight 1 million dollar donations to the following nonprofit groups: <a href=\"https://teamrubiconusa.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Team Rubicon</a>, <a href=\"https://childrenshungerfund.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Children&#x2019;s Hunger Fund</a>, <a href=\"https://pen.org/\">PEN America</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thetrevorproject.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Trevor Project</a>, <a href=\"https://www.naacpldf.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund</a>, <a href=\"https://www.firstgenerationinvestors.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">First Generation Investors</a>, <a href=\"https://www.globalrefuge.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Global Refuge</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Planned Parenthood</a>. </p><p>Beyond that, we made many additional one million dollar donations to reinforce our technical infrastructure in America &#x2013; <a href=\"https://www.wikipedia.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>, <a href=\"https://archive.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Internet Archive</a>, <a href=\"https://commoncrawl.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Common Crawl Foundation</a>, <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Let&#x2019;s Encrypt</a>, pioneering independent internet journalism, and several other crucial open source software infrastructure projects that power much of the world today.</p><p>I encourage every American to <a href=\"https://www.charitynavigator.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">contribute soon</a>, however you can, to organizations you feel are effectively helping those most currently in need.</p><p>But short term fixes are not enough.</p><p>The <strong>Pledge To Share The American Dream</strong> requires a much more ambitious second act &#x2013; deeper, long term changes that will take decades. Over the next five years, my family pledges half our remaining wealth to plant a seed toward foundational long term efforts ensuring that all Americans continue to have the same fair access to the American Dream.</p><p>Let me tell you about my own path to the American Dream. It was rocky. My parents were born into deep poverty in Mercer County, West Virginia, and Beaufort County, North Carolina. Our family eventually clawed our way to the bottom of the middle class in Virginia. </p><p>I won&#x2019;t dwell on it, but every family has their own problems. We did not remain middle class for long. But through all this, my parents got the most important thing right: they loved me openly and unconditionally. That is everything. It&#x2019;s the only reason I am standing here in front of you today.</p><p>With my family&#x2019;s support, I managed to achieve a solid public education in Chesterfield County, Virginia, and had the incredible privilege of an affordable state education at the <a href=\"https://www.virginia.edu/aboutuva/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">University of Virginia</a>. This is a college uniquely rooted in the beliefs of one of the most prominent Founding Fathers, Thomas Jefferson. He was a living paradox. A man of profound ideals and yet flawed &#x2013; trapped in the values of his time and place. </p><p>Still, he wrote &#x201c;Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&#x201d; at the top of the Declaration of Independence. These words were, and still are, revolutionary. They define our fundamental shared American values, although we have not always lived up to them. The American Dream isn&#x2019;t about us succeeding, alone, by ourselves, but about connecting with each other and succeeding together as Americans.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been concerned about wealth concentration in America ever since I watched a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM\" rel=\"noreferrer\">2012 video by politizane</a> illustrating just how extreme wealth concentration already was. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"></figure><p>I had no idea how close we were to the American Gilded Age from the late 1800s. This period was given a name in the 1920s by historians referencing Mark Twain&#x2019;s 1873 novel, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gilded_Age:_A_Tale_of_Today\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Gilded Age, A Tale of Today</a>. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-151.png\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p>During this time, labor strikes often turned violent, with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_strike\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Homestead Strike of 1892</a> resulting in deadly confrontations between workers and Pinkerton guards hired by factory owners. Rapid industrialization created hazardous working conditions in factories, mines, and railroads, where thousands died due to insufficient safety regulations and employers who prioritized profit over worker welfare.</p><p>In January 2025, while I was still writing <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/stay-gold-america/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">&#x201c;Stay Gold, America&#x201d;</a>, we entered the period of greatest wealth concentration in the entirety of American history. As of 2021, the <a href=\"https://usafacts.org/articles/how-this-chart-explains-americans-wealth-across-income-levels/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">top 1% of households controlled 32% of all wealth</a>, while the bottom 50% only have 2.6%. It&apos;s difficult to find more recent data, but wealth concentration has only intensified in the last four years.</p><p>We can no longer say &#x201c;Gilded Age&#x201d;.</p><p>We must now say &#x201c;The First Gilded Age&#x201d;.</p><p>Today, in our <em>second</em> Gilded Age, more and more people find their path to the American Dream blocked. When Americans face unaffordable education, lack of accessible healthcare, or lack affordable housing, they aren&apos;t just disadvantaged &#x2013; they&apos;re trapped, often burdened by massive debt. They have no stable foundation to build their lives. They watch desperately, working as hard as they can, while life simply passes them by, without even the freedom to choose their own lives.</p><p>They don&apos;t have time to build a career. They don&apos;t have time to learn, to improve. They don&apos;t get to start a business. They can&#x2019;t choose where their kids will grow up, or whether to have children at all, because they can&#x2019;t afford to. Here in the land of opportunity, the pursuit of happiness has become an endless task for too many. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"1141\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-152.png\" width=\"1178\" /></figure><p>We are denying people any real chance of achieving the dream that we promised them &#x2013; that we promised the entire world &#x2013; when we founded this nation. It is such a profound betrayal of everything we ever dreamed about. Without a stable foundation to build a life on, our fellow Americans cannot even <em>pursue</em> the American Dream, much less achieve it.</p><p>I ask you this: as an American, what is the purpose of a dream left unshared with so many for so long? What&#x2019;s happening to our dream? Are we really willing to let go of our values so easily? We&#x2019;re Americans. We fight for our values, the values embodied in our dream, the ones we founded this country on. </p><p>Why aren&#x2019;t we sharing the American Dream? </p><p>Why aren&#x2019;t we giving everyone a fair chance at Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness by providing them the fundamentals they need to get there?</p><p>The Dream worked for me, decades ago, and I deeply believe that the American Dream can still work for everyone &#x2013; if we ensure every American has the same fair chance we did. The American Dream was never about a few people being extraordinarily wealthy. It&#x2019;s about everyone having an equal chance to succeed and pursue their dreams &#x2013; their own happiness. It belongs to them. I think we owe them at least that. I think we owe <em>ourselves</em> at least that.</p><p>What can we do about this? There are no easy answers. I can&#x2019;t even pretend to have the answer, because there isn&#x2019;t any one answer to give. Nothing worth doing is ever that simple. But I can tell you this: all the studies and all the data I&#x2019;ve looked at have strongly pointed to one foundational thing we can do here in America over the next five years.</p><p>Natalie Foster, co-founder of the <a href=\"https://economicsecurityproject.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Economic Security Project</a>, makes a powerful case for the idea that, with all this concentrated wealth, we can offer a <strong>Guaranteed Minimum Income</strong> in the poorest areas of this country &#x2013; the areas of most need, where money goes the farthest &#x2013; to unlock vast amounts of untapped American potential. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1620978466/\"><img alt=\"The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/the-guarantee-book-natalie-foster-1.jpg\" width=\"467\" /></a></figure><p>This isn&#x2019;t a new idea. We&#x2019;ve been doing this a while now in different forms, but we never called it Guaranteed Minimum Income.</p><p>In <strong>1797</strong>, Thomas Paine proposed a retirement pension funded by estate taxes. It didn&#x2019;t go anywhere, but it planted a seed. Much later we implemented the Social Security Act in <strong>1935</strong> . The economic chaos of the Great Depression coupled with the inability of private philanthropy to provide economic security inspired Franklin Roosevelt&#x2019;s New Deal government programs. The most popular and effective program to emerge from this era was Social Security, providing a guaranteed income for retirees. Before Social Security, <em>half</em> of seniors lived in poverty. Today only 10% of seniors live in poverty.</p><p>In his <strong>1967</strong> book <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Do_We_Go_from_Here:_Chaos_or_Community%3F\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community</a>, Martin Luther King Jr made the moral case for a form of UBI, Universal Basic Income. King believed that economic insecurity was at the root of all inequality. He stated that a guaranteed income &#x2014; direct cash disbursements &#x2014; was the simplest and best way to fight poverty.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"1401\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-147.png\" width=\"1920\" /></figure><p>In <strong>1972</strong>, Congress established the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, providing direct cash assistance to low-income elderly, blind, and disabled individuals with little or no income. This cash can be used for food, housing, and medical expenses, the essentials for financial stability. As of January, 2025, over 7.3 million people receive SSI benefits.</p><p>In 1975, Congress passed the Tax Reduction Act, establishing the Earned Income Tax Credit. This tax credit benefits working-class parents with children, encouraging work by increasing the income of low-income workers. In 2023, it lifted about 6.4 million people out of poverty, including 3.4 million children. <a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p60-283.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">According to the Census Bureau</a>, it is the second most effective anti-poverty tool after Social Security.</p><p>In 2019, directly inspired by King, mayor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Tubbs\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Michael Tubbs</a> &#x2013; at age 26, one of the youngest mayors in American history &#x2013; launched the $3 million <a href=\"https://www.stocktondemonstration.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration</a>. It provided 125 residents with $500 per month in unconditional cash payments for two years. The program found that recipients experienced improved financial stability, increased full-time employment, and enhanced well-being.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img alt=\"The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-150.png\" width=\"1200\" /><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Michael Tubbs, Former Mayor of Stockton, on </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rSQCNd0Dr8\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Creating a California for All</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>In my &#x201c;Stay Gold, America&#x201d; blog post, I referenced the Robert Frost &quot;Stay Gold&quot; poem and S.E. Hinton&apos;s famous famous novel The Outsiders, urging us to retain our youthful ideals as we grow older. Ideals embodied in the American Dream.</p><p>Which brings us to another Robert Frost poem, the <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Road Not Taken</a>. Our proposal to ensure access to the American Dream is to follow the path less travelled by:  <strong>Guaranteed Minimum Income. </strong>GMI is a simpler, more practical, more scalable plan to directly address the root of economic insecurity with minimum bureaucracy.</p><p>We are partnering with GiveDirectly, who oversaw <a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/united-states/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the most GMI studies</a> in the United States, and OpenResearch, who just completed the <a href=\"https://www.openresearchlab.org/studies/unconditional-cash-study/study\" rel=\"noreferrer\">largest, most detailed GMI study</a> ever conducted in this country in 2023. We are working together to launch a new Guaranteed Minimum Income initiative in rural American communities.</p><p>Network effects within communities explain why equality of opportunity is so effective, and why a shared American Dream is the most powerful dream of all. The potential of the American Dream becomes vastly greater as more people have access to it, <strong>because<em> they share it</em><em>.</em></strong></p><p>They share it with their families, their friends, and their neighbors. The groundbreaking, massive <a href=\"https://www.openresearchlab.org/studies/unconditional-cash-study/documentation\" rel=\"noreferrer\">2023 OpenResearch UBI study data</a> showed that when you give money to the poorest among us, they consistently go <em>out</em> <em>of their way</em> to share that money with others in desperate need.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://www.openresearchlab.org/studies/unconditional-cash-study/documentation\"><img alt=\"The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"966\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/openresearch-ubi-study-expenditures.png\" width=\"1719\" /></a></figure><p>The power of opportunity is not in what it can do for one person, but how it connects and strengthens bonds between people. When you empower a couple, you allow them to build a family. When you empower families, you allow them to build a community. When you guarantee fundamentals, you&apos;re providing a foundation for those connections to grow and thrive. This is the incredible power and value of community. That is what we are investing in &#x2013; each other.</p><p>A system where there are no guarantees creates conflict. It creates inequality. A massive concentration of wealth in so few hands weakens connections between us and prevents new ones. America began as a place of connection. Millions of us came together to build this nation, not individually, but together. Equality is connection, and connection is more valuable than any product any company will ever sell you.</p><p>Why focus on rural communities? There are consistently higher poverty rates in rural counties, with fewer job opportunities, lower wages, and worse access to healthcare and education. It&#x2019;s not a new problem, either &#x2014; places like Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, and American Indian reservations have been stuck in poverty for decades, with some counties like Oglala Lakota, SD (55.8%) and McDowell, WV (37.6%) hitting extreme levels. Meanwhile, urban counties rarely see numbers that high. The data from the US Census and USDA Economic Research Service make it clear: if you&#x2019;re poor in America, being rural makes it even harder to escape.</p><p>Rural areas also offer smaller populations, which is helpful because we need to start small with lots of tightly controlled studies that we can carefully scale and improve on for larger areas. We hope to build a large body of scientific data showing that GMI really does improve the lives, and the communities, of our fellow Americans.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-149.png\" width=\"1600\" /></figure><h3 id=\"the-initial-plan-is-to-target-a-few-counties-that-i-have-a-personal-connection-to-and-are-still-currently-in-poverty-decades-later\">The initial plan is to target a few counties that I have a personal connection to, and are still currently in poverty, decades later:</h3><ul><li>My father was born in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer_County,_West_Virginia\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mercer County</a>, West Virginia, where the collapse of coal mining left good people struggling to survive. Their living and their way of life is now all but gone, and good jobs are hard to find.</li><li>My mother&#x2019;s birthplace, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_County,_North_Carolina\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Beaufort County</a>, North Carolina, has been hit just as hard, with farming and factory jobs disappearing and families left wondering what&#x2019;s next.</li><li>Our third county is yet to be decided, but will be a community also facing the same systemic, generational obstacles to economic stability and achieving the American Dream.</li></ul><p>We will work with existing local groups to coordinate GMI studies where community members choose to enroll. We will conduct outreach and and provide mentorship to these opt-in study participants. It will be teamwork between Americans.</p><p>We hope Veterans will play a crucial role in our effort. We plan to work with local communities and veteran-serving organizations to engage veterans to support and execute our GMI programs &#x2013; the same veterans who served our country with distinction, returning home with exceptional leadership skills and a deep commitment to their communities. Their involvement ensures these programs reflect core American values of self-reliance and community service to fellow Americans. </p><p>We&apos;ll also partner with established community organizations &#x2014; churches, civic groups, community colleges, local businesses. These partnerships help integrate our GMI studies with existing support systems, rather than creating new ones.</p><p><a href=\"https://givedirectly.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GiveDirectly</a> and <a href=\"https://www.openresearchlab.org/studies/unconditional-cash-study/study\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OpenResearch</a> will build on their existing body of work, gathering extensive data from these refined studies. We&apos;ll measure employment, entrepreneurship, education, health, and community engagement. We&apos;ll conduct regular interviews with participants to understand their experience. How is this working for you? How can we make it better? You tell us. How can we make it better together?</p><p>Economic security isn&apos;t only about individual well-being &#x2013; it&apos;s the bedrock of democracy. When people aren&apos;t constantly worried about feeding themselves, feeding their family, having decent healthcare, having a place to live&#x2026; we have given them room to breathe. We have given them freedom. The freedom to raise their children, the freedom to start businesses, the freedom to choose where they work, the freedom to volunteer... the freedom to <em>vote</em>.</p><p>This isn&#x2019;t about ideology or government. It&#x2019;s about us, as Americans, working together to invest in our future &#x2013; possibly the greatest unlocking of human potential in our entire history. I do not say these things lightly. I&#x2019;ve seen it work. I&#x2019;ve looked at all the existing study data. A little bit of money is incredibly transformational for people in poverty &#x2013; the people who need it the most &#x2013; the people who cannot live up to their potential because they&#x2019;re so busy simply trying to survive. Imagine what they could do if we gave them just a little breathing room.</p><p>GMI is a long term investment in the future of what America should be, the way we wrote it down in the Declaration of Independence, perhaps incompletely &#x2013; but our democracy was always meant to be malleable, to change, to adapt, and improve.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"The Road Not Taken is Guaranteed Minimum Income\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/03/image-148.png\" width=\"1200\" /></figure><p>I&#x2019;d like to conclude by mentioning <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Aaron Swartz</a>. He was a precocious teenage programmer much like myself. Aaron helped develop RSS web feeds, co-founded Reddit, and worked with Creative Commons to create flexible copyright licenses for the common good. He used technology to make information universally accessible to everyone.</p><p>Aaron created a system to download public domain court documents from PACER, a government database that charged fees for accessing what he believed should be freely available public information. A few years later, while visiting MIT under their open campus policy and as a research fellow at Harvard, he used MIT&apos;s network to download millions of academic articles from JSTOR, another fee-charging online academic journal repository, intending to make this knowledge freely accessible. Since taxpayers had funded much of this research, why shouldn&#x2019;t that knowledge be freely available to everyone?</p><p>What Aaron saw as an act of academic freedom and information equality, authorities viewed as a crime&#x2014;he was arrested in January 2011 and charged with multiple felonies for what many considered to be nothing more than accessing knowledge that should have been freely available to the public in the first place.</p><p>Despite JSTOR declining to pursue charges and MIT eventually calling for leniency, federal prosecutors aggressively pursued felony charges against Aaron with up to 35 years in prison. Facing overwhelming legal pressure and the prospect of being labeled a felon, Aaron took his own life at 26. This sparked widespread criticism of prosecutorial overreach and prompted discussions about open access to information. Deservedly so. Eight days later, in this very hall, there was a standing room only memorial service praising Aaron for his commitment to the public good.</p><p>Aaron pursued what was right for we, the people. He chose to build the public good despite knowing there would be risks. He chose to be an activist. I think we should all choose to be activists, to be brave, to stand up for our defining American principles. </p><h2 id=\"there-are-two-things-i-ask-of-you-today\">There are two things I ask of you today.</h2><ol><li>Visit <a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/rural-us/\">givedirectly.org/rural-us</a> where we&apos;ll be documenting our journey and findings from the initial three GMI rural county studies. Let&#x2019;s find out together how guaranteed minimum income can transform American lives.</li><li>Talk about <strong>Guaranteed Minimum Income</strong> in your communities. Meet with your state and local officials. Share the existing study data. Share outcomes. Ask them about conducting GMI studies like ours in your area. We tell ourselves stories about why some people succeed and others don&apos;t. Challenge those stories. Economic security is not <em>charity</em>. It is an <em>investment</em> in vast untapped American potential in the poorest areas of this country.</li></ol><p>My family is committing 50 million dollars to this endeavor, but imagine if we had even more to share. Imagine how much more we could do, if we build this together, starting today. Decades from now, people will look back and wonder why it took us so long to share our dream of a better, richer, and fuller life with our fellow Americans.</p><p>I hope you join us on this grand experiment to share our American Dream. I believe everyone deserves a fair chance at what was promised when we founded this nation: Life, Liberty, and <em>the pursuit of The American Dream.</em></p>"

The only way we were able to get the pricing that low was by signing a four-year contract. That contract expires this summer, June 30, so that's our departure date for the final leg of <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/we-have-left-the-cloud-251760fb\">our cloud exit</a>.</div><div><br />We've already racked the replacement from <a href=\"https://www.purestorage.com/\">Pure Storage</a> in our two primary data centers. A combined 18 petabytes, securely replicated a thousand miles apart. It's a gorgeous rack full of blazing-fast NVMe storage modules.

This makes it pretty easy from the app side to do the swap.&nbsp;<br /><br /></div><div>But there's still work to do. We have to transfer almost six petabytes out of S3. In an earlier age, that egress alone would have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees alone. But now AWS offers <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/free-data-transfer-out-to-internet-when-moving-out-of-aws/\">a free 60-day egress window</a> for anyone who wants to leave, so that drops the cost to $0. Nice!</div><div><br />It takes a while to transfer that much data, though. Even on the fat 40-Gbit pipe we have set aside for the purpose, it'll probably take at least three weeks, once you factor in overhead and some babysitting of the process.<br /><br /></div><div>That's when it's good to remind ourselves why June 30th matters. And the reminder math pens out in nice, round numbers for easy recollection: If we don't get this done in time, we'll be paying a cool <em>five thousand dollars a day</em> to continue to use S3 (if all the files are still there). Yikes!<br /><br /></div><div>That's $35,000/week! That's $150,000/month!<br /><br /></div><div>Pretty serious money for a company of our size. But so are the savings. Over five years, it'll now be almost five million! Maybe even more, depending on the growth in files we need to store for customers. About $1.5 million for the Pure Storage hardware, and a bit less than a million over five years for warranty and support.</div><div><br />But those big numbers always seem a bit abstract to me.

                "<p>If you were in South America 12,000 years ago and you discovered where a bunch of glyptodonts were hiding or you figured out a better glyptodont hunting method, you could tell your tribal band and later they would say, <em>thank you for helping us kill these delicious glyptodonts we now think you are cool and now will treat you slightly better</em>. And that was that. There was no other reward for producing information.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, we have new tricks. If you write a book or patent a drug and someone starts selling copies without your permission, you can ask the government to take their money or put them in prison. If you\u2019re a scientist, you can ask the government to give you money so you can do science and then give it away.</p>\n\n<p>Why do these things exist? Well, information is cool because it\u2019s cheap to copy. But for the same reason, it tends to be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good\">undersupplied</a>. Say that if I worked hard I could find some new fact, e.g. that ultrasonic humidifiers are bad. This only helps me a little, since they\u2019re not <em>that</em> bad. If I got even 5% of the extra lifespan gained by each person who kills their humidifier, I would spend all day everyday looking for such facts. But I don\u2019t, so I don\u2019t. (Also no one believes me.)</p>\n\n<p>Patents and copyrights and science grants <em>feel</em> inevitable and boring. But take a step back. How close do these things get us to \u201coptimal\u201d, to rewarding someone with $500 when they create information that provides society with $1000 of value?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is not close <em>at all</em>. Because:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Yes, we want socially optimal information production.</li>\n  <li>But also, restricting what words people are allowed to say to each other is impossible and tyrannical.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Our tricks are a messy patchwork that try to bridge the yawning chasm between those two realities. We reward information production, but only in a few limited cases where it\u2019s easy to enforce without intruding too much on basic liberties.</p>\n\n<p>In this post, I\u2019ll argue that our existing tricks ingeniously allow \u201cfacts\u201d to flow freely (yay liberty) while also creating <em>indirect</em> subsidies for finding new facts (yay information production). But this only works because of certain coincidental facts about the world. And AI is in the process of changing those facts.</p>\n\n<p>So, why do we have the tricks we have? What makes them work? Will they still work in a post-AI world? How could they be changed?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"we-have-ways-of-making-you-talk\">We have ways of making you talk</h2>\n\n<p>Roughly speaking, we have five main tricks to reward information production today.</p>\n\n<p>First, you can <strong>copyright</strong> creative works, like books or music or code. This lasts for your life plus ~70 years.</p>\n\n<p>Second, you can <strong>patent</strong> new inventions, like drugs or machines or algorithms. This lasts ~20 years.</p>\n\n<p>Third, you can create <strong>trade secrets</strong>. These aren\u2019t just secrets! If you run a business and you discover basically <em>any</em> useful information, then as long as you make \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to keep it secret, it\u2019s a <em>crime</em> for someone to steal your secret. Even if everything they do is otherwise legal, just obtaining the information is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Espionage_Act_of_1996\">\u201ceconomic espionage\u201d</a>. This protection lasts <em>forever</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, you can get <strong>direct subsidies</strong>. Journalism is increasingly funded by philanthropy. The government gives money to scientists so they can do science and make the resulting knowledge freely available (to some for-profit publisher who then charges the public $30/article for the same science they already paid for with taxes).</p>\n\n<p>Finally, <strong>social norms</strong> are as important today as ever. I\u2019m often tempted to take <a href=\"https://mattlakeman.org/2020/07/10/how-much-would-you-need-to-be-paid-to-live-on-a-deserted-island-for-1-5-years-and-do-nothing-but-kill-seals/\">How Much Would You Need to be Paid to Live on a Deserted Island for 1.5 Years and Do Nothing but Kill\u00a0Seals?</a> and re-post it like I\u2019d written it, but I don\u2019t because I fear that word would spread that I\u2019m a big thieving loser. More prosaically, if one journalist makes a big discovery, it\u2019s totally legal for others to re-report the facts without giving them credit. But journalists have a culture where credit is expected.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"seals\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/ideas/seals.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"these-ways-seem-weird\">These ways seem weird</h2>\n\n<p>At first glance, our system seems obvious and inevitable. At second glance, though, it seems very strange. But at third glance, that strangeness can be seen as society having made some shrewd calculations to manage the tradeoff between (a) rewarding information, and (b) not creating dubious restrictions on speech.</p>\n\n<p>So let\u2019s go through those second and third glances.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is it that copyright lasts for life plus ~70 years, while patents last for ~20 years?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Perhaps because artistic work usually has lots of substitutes. If I write a book, then I have a monopoly and I\u2019m free to charge $25,000 for it. But if I did that, everyone else would just buy some $25 book instead. My monopoly doesn\u2019t give me that much pricing power. Whereas if I invent a new drug for pancreatic cancer, I can probably charge people $100,000 per treatment. For drugs, a 20 year term still provides plenty of reward.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why do patents require filing a complicated application and paying gigantic fees, while copyright and trade secrets are automatic?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Probably because it\u2019s easy to determine who wrote a book, but hard to prove who came up with an invention.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why do patents require publishing how your invention works, while if you create a song, you don\u2019t have to share your pre-mastered multi-track audio?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Probably because creative works don\u2019t have as much \u201csecret sauce\u201d. You can read a book and figure out how it was made much more easily than you can look at a new engine and understand the engineering principles. By forcing people filing patents to publish their ideas, this helps good ideas spread more quickly. Also, <em>many</em> more creative works are created each year. It\u2019s just not worth it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why does copyright only cover artistic aspects?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, imagine that when Don Daglow created <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_(1981_video_game)\">Utopia</a> in 1981, he didn\u2019t just get a copyright on the art and characters and code, but also on the idea of a real-time strategy game. Starcraft wouldn\u2019t exist. The horror.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://pongandbeyond.com/wp/2012/08/19/47-utopia/\"><img alt=\"utopia game\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/ideas/utopia.png\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is it that even <em>conspiring</em> to steal a trade secret is illegal?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Say you and I decide to steal Coca-Cola\u2019s secret formula, so we high-five and drive to Atlanta, but then we realize we\u2019re idiots and go home. Believe it or not, we are now guilty of <em>conspiracy</em> to commit economic espionage and could theoretically be <a href=\"https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title18-section1831&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim\">imprisoned for up to 15 years</a>. Weird, huh? While this seems ridiculous, I guess prosecutors find (as with <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/espionage/\">regular espionage</a>) that it\u2019s hard to prove actual espionage and only use this power in egregious cases.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And why do trade secrets at all? Why make it illegal for someone to steal them only if you make \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to keep them secret? Why is it legal to discover trade secrets through reverse engineering, but illegal to discover them by getting engineers drunk? Why does this protection apply to basically <em>any</em> form of information, and why does it last <em>forever</em>?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think the idea is that people will keep secrets no matter what. But without laws, people would spend vast sums trying to steal and/or secure secrets, and this arms race would have no social benefit. Meanwhile, trying to make it illegal to \u201csteal\u201d things that aren\u2019t really secrets at all would trample on basic freedoms and be impossible to enforce.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why can you patent inventions but not discoveries? Why can you patent \u201calgorithms\u201d but not \u201cmath\u201d?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, imagine you <em>could</em> patent math. Would we be like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism\">Pythagoreans</a> and punish anyone who mentioned the wrong theorem? It\u2019s far easier to judge if someone is <em>using</em> math, which is sort of the definition of an algorithm. Better to just pay mathematicians out of taxes and let the math be free.</p>\n\n<p>So, I view these tricks as a very clever and highly evolved solution to a difficult problem. If you take all the possible ways you <em>could</em> reward information and then sort them by (ease of implementation) \u00d7 (how much ideas are rewarded), you\u2019d probably end up with something close to our current system.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"intermission-no-really-theyre-weird\">Intermission: No really, they\u2019re weird</h2>\n\n<p>While I think our tricks are clever, we shouldn\u2019t forget that they\u2019re <em>highly</em> imperfect and lead lots of perversity. In case you\u2019re a perversity aficionado, I\u2019ve collected here some favorites:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Say you suspect that some type of fungus might cure cancer, so you spend $50 billion checking each of the 144,000 known fungal species. And say you actually find one that works. Too bad! The fungus already existed, so that\u2019s a \u201cdiscovery\u201d, not an \u201cinvention\u201d. You might be able to patent some extract or something, but if you\u2019re charging $100,000 per cure, people will find ways around the patent. Better not to spend that $50 billion in the first place.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Information production is sometimes rewarded through bundling. For decades, local newspapers made half their revenue from classified ads. This was a great business, since printing classified ads costs almost nothing. But because economics is weird, they found it was profitable to also pay tons of money for reporters who would create news, and then bundle the news and classified ads together. Then Craigslist was invented and now most of those newspapers are dead.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>You\u2019ve surely noticed that recipe sites have thousands of words of inane blabbering before they show the actual recipe. That\u2019s partly to manipulate search engines and to have more space for ads. But it\u2019s also because inane blabbering is copyrightable but recipes are not.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Many people find it strange that you can patent \u201cbusiness methods\u201d. But did you know this was already happening in France in 1792? As some people were arresting Louis XVI, others were filing patents for financial inventions. (Though these were later deemed invalid.)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Believe it or not, you can patent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_patent\">methods for reducing taxes</a>. I\u2019m unsure what public interest is served by rewarding such inventions.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>You\u2019ve probably heard that map makers sometimes add fake \u201ctrap cities\u201d or \u201ctrap streets\u201d. The idea is that if your traps appear on another map, you\u2019ve got them dead to rights on copyright violation, right? Turns out: <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/796/729/1559434/\">Nope</a>. Locations of cities and streets are facts. A fake fact isn\u2019t a form of creative expression and still isn\u2019t copyrightable.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img alt=\"agloe, NY\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/ideas/agloe.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>One of the central concepts of patents is that you must publish your invention. But companies don\u2019t like telling their competitors about their inventions. So many\u2014particularly pharmaceutical companies\u2014pay lawyers gigantic sums to write patents in a way that\u2019s legally valid but impossible for a normal person to read. In response, their competitors pay <em>their</em> lawyers gigantic sums to decode the legal gibberish, and sometimes get patents translated from other countries (often Japan) that are less tolerant of such chicanery.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>When Don Daglow created <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_(1981_video_game)\">Utopia</a> in 1981, he couldn\u2019t have copyrighted the idea of real-time strategy game. But he might have been able to <em>patent</em> some version of that idea. I\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"about-those-indirect-subsidies\">About those indirect subsidies</h2>\n\n<p>We\u2019re 1900 words in. What is this post about again? Oh yeah:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Our current tricks for rewarding information production rely on coincidental facts about how the world works.</li>\n  <li>Artificial intelligence is changing those facts.</li>\n  <li>???</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What are these coincidental facts? Well, \u201cfacts\u201d and \u201cdiscoveries\u201d are important. We want more of them! But <em>legally</em> protecting these things seems terrible, because that requires you to police what words people can say to each other.</p>\n\n<p>But copyright still cleverly provides <em>indirect</em> subsidies for creating facts and making discoveries. I\u2019ll highlight two.</p>\n\n<p>First, while you can\u2019t copyright facts, you can copyright \u201cpresentations\u201d of facts. If I write a book, you are free to steal all my facts and write your own book. But, for humans, doing that is hard. If you go way back to, like, three years ago, \u201cunbundling\u201d the facts from their presentation took a ton of work. Now, AI can do this instantly and for near-zero cost.</p>\n\n<p>Second, I suspect that a <em>lot</em> of creation is driven by our old tribal band instincts. Like why am I writing this? Probably because some part of me hopes that after I post it, glowing pixels will show up on my screen which my brain will interpret as meaning that people love me or whatever. I\u2019m pretty sure this doesn\u2019t provide concrete benefits that will increase my chances of passing on my genes, but my brain is still operating on some confused heuristics where \u201cmore glowing pixels\u201d means \u201cmore sexual opportunities\u201d or \u201cmore friends to provide resources in times of need\u201d or something.</p>\n\n<p>AI is overturning both of these. A few months back I did some research into how well LLMs can <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/more-chess/\">play chess</a>. My most surprising finding was that if you asked chat-based LLMs to regurgitate the full sequence of moves before choosing a new one, that greatly improved performance. I\u2019m pretty sure I was the first person to show this.</p>\n\n<p>A few weeks later, I asked Google \u201ccan llms play chess\u201d.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/ideas/google.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>No credit. Beyond the idea of replaying moves, several quotes were taken from me almost verbatim.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/ideas/quote1.png\" /></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/ideas/quote2.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>If a human did this, most people would think it was rude. But at least I\u2019d know that they paid a tax on their time, and hypothetically some people might think less of them for having done it. AI does it instantly, for free, and does not care about social approval.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I don\u2019t mean to beat up on poor Google. I actually think they deserve credit for exceptionally <em>good</em> behavior. Many AI companies offer you a way to <a href=\"https://github.com/ai-robots-txt/ai.robots.txt\">signal</a> that you don\u2019t want your content used for AI, but then they ignore their own signal and if you try to block them they switch IP addresses. I expected Google to say, \u201cSure, you can block our AI, we love you, just add the same signal that completely removes your website from our search engine.\u201d But no. They offer a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers#google-extended\">different signal</a> just for AI, and they actually respect it. I <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/robots.txt\">added it</a>, and when I checked a few weeks later, Google no longer provided any <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=can+llms+play+chess\">AI summary at all</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So, good on Google for giving creators some control. But I\u2019m skeptical that this is what the future will look like.</p>\n\n<p>Some people I respect say that they now write <em>for</em> AI. I admire this zen-like detachment from earthly concerns. But really? You\u2019re happy to spend your time creating information just to feed it into a training set, so it can be used for purposes you might hate, and without giving you any reward, neither money nor recognition? For better or for worse, I don\u2019t feel that way.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-could-be-done\">What could be done?</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Option: Do nothing</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a strong choice! As I see it, our historical compromise was to try to reward information production, but to take a light touch. Only do it in a few places, where it can be done at low cost, with unambiguous rules that don\u2019t involve degrading intrusions on basic human liberty.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe AI changes how well that compromise works. But that doesn\u2019t imply that we should change anything. After all, when Craigslist debundled the news from classified ads, we didn\u2019t make Craigslist illegal. We just left newspapers to their fate. This meant less news, particularly in smaller markets, and I think this has had some bad effects. But tend to think it was the right choice. Even if you ignore \u201cfreedom\u201d, people have saved billions of dollars, and people trade far more goods now than when newspapers had a monopoly.</p>\n\n<p>And we shouldn\u2019t forget that AI also has (possibly enormous) positive effects on information production, by making it easier and cheaper.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Change how copyright and/or patents and/or trade secrets work?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have a couple (possibly bad) ideas for minor tinkering at the margins, below. In principle, we could make some kind of dramatic change. But I don\u2019t see many options without huge problems. Can you think of anything? This all seems under-theorized.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Increase non-market incentives for information production?</strong></p>\n\n<p>After Craigslist killed newspapers, some started adding paywalls. Paywalls are, theoretically, a market-based solution. But I suspect that a lot of people who subscribe to these newspapers (and blogs (not me, money bad)) do it not just out of self-interest, but because they want to support them. They think what they\u2019re doing is good for the world and they want to encourage it. There are also many charities that fund journalism.</p>\n\n<p>And OK, maybe AI decreases the incentives for internet randos to do research and share it with the world. How much information is really lost by this? How hard would it be to provide more grants (or post-hoc \u201cawards\u201d) to make up for what\u2019s lost?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Clarify the meaning of a derivative work.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Say you create a game. You write code and sell me an executable. Then I take the executable, decompile it, replace all your art with new version, and then re-compile it for some other operating system and start selling it. Can you go to court and take my money?</p>\n\n<p>Yes, because your source code was copyrighted, and my new executable would be a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work\">\u201cderivative work\u201d</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But say you write a book, and I get an AI to re-write it. Can you take my money? The legal standard here is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantial_similarity\">\u201csubstantial similarity\u201d</a> which is just as confusing as it sounds. Courts talk about \u201ctotal concept and feel test\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive non-literal similarity\u201d versus \u201cfragmented literal similarity\u201d. As far as I can tell, this is an incredibly blurry boundary that we\u2019ve only gotten away with because cases are relatively rare.</p>\n\n<p>AI will force us to find a clearer boundary, one that doesn\u2019t require judges to listen to individual pieces of music.</p>\n\n<p>But I\u2019m not sure a clear boundary would do much to incentivize creators. If we had a magic box that perfectly decided what\u2019s infringing and what isn\u2019t, I don\u2019t expect that the response will be for AI companies to pay creators. Rather, they\u2019ll probably just tune their AIs to run <em>right up</em> to that boundary. Instead of re-writing one books, rewrite <em>N</em> books for whatever value of <em>N</em> is legal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create a legal opt-out.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many companies theoretically offer an opt-out. It\u2019s a <em>different</em> opt out for each company, and many of them seem to just ignore it.</p>\n\n<p>In principle, governments could create a legal mandate for this. It could even be fine-grained. Then, companies might compete with each other to make creators happy.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s quite possible that such a mandate would be a disaster. For one thing, it would be a headache to enforce\u2014would Federal AI inspectors demand to inspect the training data for all AI companies?</p>\n\n<p>And for any even moderately popular blogger, lots of people steal their articles and re-post them without credit. (Google and Bing usually de-list these sites, but you can find them with Yandex.) If they have different opt-out headers, how are AI companies supposed to know which one is correct?</p>\n\n<p>Most of all, I worry that that this mandate would just hurt \u201cgood\u201d companies and/or companies in jurisdictions that actually enforce the mandate. If the effect was to hand AI leadership over to That Other Country, that seems bad.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Go Xanadu</strong></p>\n\n<p>Or maybe we could develop technology that would solve this problem using <em>existing</em> laws.</p>\n\n<p>A while back, I mentioned <a href=\"https://xanadu.net/\">Project Xanadu, The Original Hypertext Project</a>. I was mostly attracted by their attitude. (\u201cIt is a continual war over software politics and paradigms. With ideas which are still radical, WE FIGHT ON.\u201d) But I couldn\u2019t really understand what the hell it actually <em>was</em>. But then I read Jason Crawford\u2019s <a href=\"https://jasoncrawford.org/the-lessons-of-xanadu\">The lessons of Xanadu</a> and WIRED magazine\u2019s 1995 piece <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/\">The Curse of Xanadu</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I now understand that Xanadu was (is?) intended to be a system for interlinked documents. But it also included a crazy \u201ctransclusion\u201d feature. This was some kind of distributed copyright scheme where authors could link and copy each other and royalties were somehow apportioned to all upstream documents.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"xanadu\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/ideas/xanadu.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Maybe we don\u2019t need new laws. Maybe a solution exists that uses a combination of technology and existing <em>contract</em> law. There\u2019s a very large space of possibilities, and I don\u2019t pretend to have the answer. But at a high level, there could be some system where people (and AIs?) put their creations. In order to access the system, you have to agree to distribute royalties according to some formula, and to treat anything learned through the system as a trade secret.</p>\n\n<p>In principle, it seems like essentially any combination of technology and laws could be implemented this way? And there could be a competition to find the best one? And we don\u2019t have to rely on the Leviathan? And it might be better than our current crazy hacks?</p>\n\n<p>Seems hard, but it\u2019s the best idea I\u2019ve got.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"tldr\">TLDR</h2>\n\n<p>Weird situation, evolving, new ideas needed.</p>"

To do that, we ran one-day workshops where professionals from Europe and the US had to actually develop product ideas, packaging, retail strategies and other tasks for the business units they really worked for, which included baby products, feminine care, grooming, and oral care. Teams with the best ideas had them submitted to management for approval, so there were some real stakes involved.</p><p>We also had two kinds of professionals in our experiment: commercial experts and technical R&amp;D experts. They were generally very experienced, with over 10 years of work at P&amp;G alone. We randomly created teams consisting of one person in each specialty. Half were given GPT-4 or GPT-4o to use, and half were not. We also picked a random set of both types of specialists to work alone, and gave half of them access to AI. Everyone assigned to the AI condition was given a training session and a set of prompts they could use or modify. This design allowed us to isolate the effects of AI and teamwork independently and in combination. We measured outcomes across multiple dimensions including solution quality (as determined by at least two expert judges per solution), time spent, and participants' emotional responses. What we found was interesting.</p><h1>AI boosts performance</h1><p>When working without AI, teams outperformed individuals by a significant amount, 0.24 standard deviations (providing a sigh of relief for every teacher and manager who has pushed the value of teamwork). But the surprise came when we looked at AI-enabled participants. Individuals working with AI performed just as well as teams without AI, showing a 0.37 standard deviation improvement over the baseline. This suggests that AI effectively replicated the performance benefits of having a human teammate &#8211; one person with AI could match what previously required two-person collaboration.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f439719-d6b0-458f-bb0e-0df9796d7025_960x604.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"318.35833333333335\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f439719-d6b0-458f-bb0e-0df9796d7025_960x604.png\" width=\"506\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Teams with AI performed best overall with a 0.39 standard deviation improvement, though the difference between individuals with AI and teams with AI wasn't statistically significant.

For example, it is possible that larger teams would show very different results when working with AI, or that working with AI for longer projects may impact its value. It is also possible that our results represent a lower bound: all of these experiments were conducted with GPT-4 or GPT-4o, less capable models than what are available today; the participants did not have a lot of prompting experience so they may not have gotten as much benefit; and chatbots are not really built for teamwork. There is a lot more detail on all of this in the <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5188231\">paper</a>, but limitations aside, the bigger question might be: why does this all matter?</p><h1>Why This Matters</h1><p>Organizations have primarily viewed AI as just another productivity tool, like a better calculator or spreadsheet. This made sense initially but has become increasingly limiting as models get better and<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04761\"> as recent data finds</a> users most often employ AI for critical thinking and complex problem solving, not just routine productivity tasks. Companies that focus solely on efficiency gains from AI will not only find workers unwilling to share their AI discoveries for fear of making themselves redundant but will also miss the opportunity to think bigger about the future of work. </p><p>To successfully use AI, organizations will need to change their analogies. Our findings suggest AI sometimes functions more like a teammate than a tool. While not human, it replicates core benefits of teamwork&#8212;improved performance, expertise sharing, and positive emotional experiences. This teammate perspective should make organizations think differently about AI. It suggests a need to reconsider team structures, training programs, and even traditional boundaries between specialties. At least with the current set of AI tools, AI augments human capabilities. It democratizes expertise as well, enabling more employees to contribute meaningfully to specialized tasks and potentially opening new career pathways.</p><p>The most exciting implication may be that AI doesn't just automate existing tasks, it changes how we can think about work itself. The future of work isn't just about individuals adapting to AI, it's about organizations reimagining the fundamental nature of teamwork and management structures themselves. And that's a challenge that will require not just technological solutions, but new organizational thinking.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/subscribe\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-cybernetic-teammate/comments\"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p></p>"

Unfortunately these scrapers are terrible netizens and have been taking down site-after-site in an unintentional wide-spread DDoS attack.</p>\n<p>Over the past 6 months Bear, and every other content host on the internet, has been affected. Both <a href=\"https://status.sr.ht/issues/2025-03-17-git.sr.ht-llms/\" target=\"_blank\">Sourcehut</a> and <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1008897/\" target=\"_blank\">LWN</a> have written about their difficulties in holding back the scourge of AI scrapers. This seems to be happening to big and small players alike. Self-hosted bloggers have had to figure out rate-limiting and CDNs too, which is pretty unfair for someone who just wants to write on the internet.</p>\n<p>Bear is hit daily by bot networks requesting tens of thousands of pages in short time periods, and while I now have systems in place to prevent it actually taking down the server, when it started happening a few months ago it certainly had an impact on performance.</p>\n<p>This is a difficult problem to solve, due to the way that these scrapers are designed. The first is that only a small portion of these scrapers identify themselves as such. These are all blocked at the WAF (Web Application Firewall) level and never reach any Bear blogs (about 500,000 requests have been blocked in the last 24 hours). However the vast majority of scrapers identify themselves as regular web-browsers, and use multiple servers and IP addresses, making all of the usual tools like rate-limiting and user-agent parsing obsolete. Not to mention that they all completely ignore robots.txt and other self-regulation rules.</p>\n<p>One of the mitigation options is to add a challenge to every single page (like Cloudflare's managed challenge), but this is an unpleasant user-experience and blocks bots that are actually welcome, such as search engine crawlers. So while it is possible to mitigate <em>all</em> bot traffic, that would effectively make all blogs non-searchable on all the major search engines. Some of the LLM scrapers cheekily identify themselves as Googlebot or Yandexbot as well. This option would also affect anyone who runs scripts on their own site for backups or custom automations. Not ideal.</p>\n<p>I've had to remove <a href=\"https://docs.bearblog.dev/rss-subscriber-analytics/\" target=\"_blank\">RSS subscriber analytics</a> since I can't mitigate bots very well on RSS feeds which are explicitly designed for bots. This influx has caused the RSS analytics to be completely wrong, and it felt better to remove it than to display incorrect information.</p>\n<p>As of right now I have several strategies in place to combat this deluge that are working well. If you're a service provider or sysadmin being negatively impacted by these scrapers, <a href=\"mailto:herman@bearblog.dev\">send me an email</a> and I'd be happy to show you what's worked for me.</p>\n<p>Right now everything is under control on Bear. Over the past month bots have only managed to impact performance on Bear once, and that endpoint has since been protected. I've added significantly more active monitoring, and any time I see a spike of requests I find a common pattern, block it, and monitor whether it has affected any real users.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, none of these scrapers render CSS, and therefore don't get logged as visitors on <a href=\"https://herman.bearblog.dev/the-frustration-loop/\" target=\"_blank\">Bear's analytics</a>.</p>\n<p>The best case scenario is that the AI companies find another way to train their models without ruthlessly slashing and burning the internet. However, I doubt this will happen. Instead I see it getting worse before it gets better. More tools are being released to combat this, one interesting tool from Cloudflare is the AI Labyrinth which traps AI scrapers that ignore robots.txt in a never-ending maze of no-follow links. This is how the arms race begins.</p>\n<p>And I'm ready for it. Let's fight this exploitation of the commons.</p>"

The perfect framing is - where did Scientology come from? How did a 1940s sci-fi writer found a religion? Part of the answer is that 1940s sci-fi fandom was a really fertile place, where all of these novel mythemes about aliens, psychics, and lost civilizations were hitting a naive population certain that there must be something beyond the world they knew.

The perfect framing is - where did Scientology come from? How did a 1940s sci-fi writer found a religion?

                "<p>Many cities have regular Astral Codex Ten meetup groups. Twice a year, I try to advertise their upcoming meetups and make a bigger deal of it than usual so that irregular attendees can attend. This is one of those times.</p><p>This year we have spring meetups planned in over a hundred and eighty cities, from Tokyo, Japan to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Thanks to all the organizers who responded to my request for details, and to Meetups Czar Skyler and the Less Wrong team for making this happen.</p><p>You can find the list below, in the following order:</p><ol><li><p>Africa &amp; Middle East</p></li><li><p>Asia-Pacific (including Australia)</p></li><li><p>Europe (including UK)</p></li><li><p>North America &amp; Central America</p></li><li><p>South America</p></li></ol><p>There should very shortly be a map of these meetups on<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/community\"> the LessWrong community page</a>.</p><p>Within each region it&#8217;s alphabetized first by country then by city - so the first entry in Europe is Vienna, <strong>A</strong>ustria. The exception is the USA, where they&#8217;re also alphabetized by state - so the first entry in the USA is Huntsville, <strong>A</strong>labama.</p><p>I&#8217;ll provisionally be attending the Berkeley meetup.</p><p><strong>Extra Info For Potential Attendees</strong></p><p><strong>1. </strong>If you&#8217;re reading this, you&#8217;re invited. Please don&#8217;t feel like you &#8220;won&#8217;t be welcome&#8221; just because you&#8217;re new to the blog, demographically different from the average reader, or hate ACX and everything it stands for. You&#8217;ll be fine!<br /> <strong>2</strong>. You don&#8217;t have to RSVP or contact the organizer to be able to attend (unless the event description says otherwise); RSVPs are mostly to give organizers a better sense of how many people might show up, and let them tell you if there are last-second changes. I&#8217;ve also given email addresses or other contact information for organizers in case you have a question.<br /><strong>3.</strong> If you have any feedback on the meetup (compliments, complaints, curiosities, etc) the feedback form is here: <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/acx-meetup-survey\">tinyurl.com/acx-meetup-survey </a>. </p><p><strong>Extra Info For Meetup Organizers:<br /><br />1.</strong> If you&#8217;re the host, bring a sign that says &#8220;ACX MEETUP&#8221; and prop it up somewhere (or otherwise be identifiable).<br /><strong>2. </strong>Bring blank labels and pens for nametags.<br /><strong>3. </strong>If you&#8217;re having trouble thinking of something to talk about, the attendees probably also read ACX. Ask people about a recent post or book review that they liked.<br /><strong>4.</strong> If it&#8217;s the first meetup, people are probably just going to want to talk, and you shouldn&#8217;t try to organize some kind of planned workshop or anything like that.<br /><strong>5.</strong> Have people type their name and email address in a spreadsheet or in a Google Form (accessed via a bit.ly link or QR code), so you can start a mailing list to make organizing future meetups easier.<br /><strong>6.</strong> It&#8217;s easier to schedule a followup meetup while you&#8217;re having the first, compared to trying to do it later on by email.<br /><strong>7.</strong> If you didn&#8217;t make a LessWrong event for your meetup (or if you did but Skyler didn&#8217;t know about it) the LessWrong team did it for you using the username or email address you gave on the form. To claim your event, log into LW (or create an account) using that email address, or message the LW team on Intercom (chat button in the bottom right corner of lesswrong.com).berkel</p><p>If you need to change a meetup date or you have any other questions, please email skyler[at]rationalitymeetups[ period]org.</p><h2>Africa &amp; The Middle East</h2><h3>Egypt</h3><h4>CAIRO</h4><p>Contact: Mostafa Shahat<br />Contact Info: ms[a t]mostafashahat[period]com<br />Time: Sunday, April 20th, 12:00 PM<br />Location: Consoleya | We'll be in the main coworking space on the ground floor.

                "<p><strong>I.</strong></p><p>People love trying to find holes in the drowning child thought experiment. This is natural: it&#8217;s obvious you should save the child in the scenario, but much less obvious that you should give lots of charity to poor people (as it seems to imply). So there must be some distinction between the two scenarios. But most people&#8217;s cursory and uninspired attempts to find these fail.</p><p>For example, some people say the difference is distance; you&#8217;re <em>close to</em> the drowning child, but <em>far from</em> people dying in Africa. Here are some thought experiments that challenge that:</p><blockquote><p>You&#8217;re a surgeon, using a telepresence robot to operate on someone in China. In the middle of the operation, a medical student watching in the Chinese side starts choking. He is the only other person in the room (besides your patient, who is unconscious), so nobody else can help him. Your robot can do the Heimlich Maneuver and save their life, but it would delay the surgery five minutes while you readjusted the settings afterwards, which would make you late for lunch. Should you save them?</p></blockquote><p>Here it seems obvious that you should save them, even though they&#8217;re all the way in China. </p><p>Is the problem that &#8220;you&#8221; are sort of &#8220;in&#8221; China via your robot, even if not physically? Here&#8217;s another example:</p><blockquote><p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York%E2%80%93Dublin_Portal\">Dublin-NYC Portal</a> is an art installation with branches in Dublin and NYC. If you stand in front of one of the portals, you can see and (not in real life, but in our thought experiment) hear the people on the other side. It&#8217;s usually too crowded to really interact with, so one day you (in NYC) go to the installation at 3 AM and are the only person around. You start talking to two Dubliners, who are the only people around on their side of the portal. Suddenly, one of them starts choking. The other shrieks &#8220;I need to do the Heimlich Maneuver, but I don&#8217;t know how!&#8221; You know how, and could easily walk them through it. But it&#8217;s cold and you want to go home. Should you help them?</p></blockquote><p>Again, the answer is clear even though you&#8217;re 3000 miles away. At this point, saying that you&#8217;re &#8220;virtually&#8221; in Dublin seems like a stretch. Here the issue seems to be some sort of entanglement. But it&#8217;s hard to say exactly how the entanglement works, and it <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> seem to be a simple one-to-one correspondence where you&#8217;re the only person who can help. For example:</p><blockquote><p>You&#8217;re at the Sociopathic Jerks Convention (you&#8217;re neither sociopathic nor a jerk - you&#8217;re the caterer). Everyone is on the lawn of the conference center, waiting for one of the sessions to begin, when you all notice a child drowning in the lake nearby. Along with yourself, there are 1,000 sociopathic jerks. But at the last session, someone took a poll on exactly this question and everyone agreed they wouldn&#8217;t lift a finger to help; either you save the child, or nobody does. Do you jump in and save them?</p></blockquote><p>Here it seems like the sociopathic jerks might as well be furniture - their presence doesn&#8217;t change your situation compared to the scenario where you&#8217;re there alone.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>TracingWoodgrains <a href=\"https://x.com/tracewoodgrains/status/1711050089282621789\">draws off</a> a now-deleted essay by Jaibot which talks about the &#8220;Copenhagen interpretation of ethics&#8221;. It argues that by &#8220;touching&#8221; a situation - a vague term having something to do with causal entanglement - you gain moral obligation for it. If you can simply avoid touching it, your moral obligation goes away.</p><p>I think this explains half the problem, but I can think of another half that it doesn&#8217;t explain. Consider:</p><blockquote><p>You inherit a beautiful cabin in the woods. It&#8217;s downstream of a vast semi-magical megacity which is a little denser than should be physically possible. Every time a child falls into any of the megacity&#8217;s streams, lakes, or rivers, they get swept away and flow past your cabin; there&#8217;s a new drowning child every hour or so.</p></blockquote><p>Assume that all unmentioned details are resolved in whatever way makes the thought experiment most unsettling - so for example, maybe the megacity inhabitants are well-intentioned, but haven&#8217;t hired their own lifeguards because their city is so vast that this is only #999 on their list of causes of death and nobody&#8217;s gotten around to it yet.</p><p>Here I&#8217;m split on whether the Copenhagen hypothesis works. A person who lives in the cabin and fails to rescue every child seems much less monstrous than someone who only ever encounters the situation once, even though both of them &#8220;touch&#8221; the situation exactly as much. Still, as the hypothesis predicts, we are less comfortable with this situation than the normal one where you live far away from the cabin and never worry about it - living near the cabin (&#8220;touching&#8221; the situation) seems to have some moral impact.</p><p>Here&#8217;s somewhere I think Copenhagen more clearly fails:</p><blockquote><p>Your regular house burns down, and you have no choice but to live in the cabin for a while. You think to yourself: &#8220;Well, every day, I&#8217;ll rescue one child, then not worry about it. This is better for the children, since it increases their survival rate from 0 to 1/24. And it&#8217;s better for me, since I&#8217;m not homeless while I wait for them to rebuild my house). It&#8217;s a win-win situation.</p><p>So you do this for a few months, and then they rebuild your house, and you move back to your regular hometown. You live there for five years without incident. One day, you see a child drowning in the local river. You don&#8217;t recognize them, so it can&#8217;t be the child of any of your fellow citizens - probably their parents are some of the travelers who pass through this town on the way to greener pastures. You are late for an important business meeting, you&#8217;re wearing a nice suit, and it would be especially annoying to jump in a river right now. In fact, you estimate that it is 10x costlier to rescue this child than any of the children who you encountered at the cabin so long ago. What do you do?</p></blockquote><p>Here Copenhagen fails to predict a difference between refusing to rescue the 37th kid going past the cabin, vs. refusing to rescue the single kid in your hometown; you are &#8220;touching&#8221; both equally. But I think most people would consider it common sense that refusing to rescue the 37th kid near the cabin is a minor/excusable sin, but refusing to rescue the one kid in your hometown is inexcusable.</p><p>Again sticking to a purely <em>descriptive</em> account of intuitions, I think this represents a sort of declining marginal utility of moral goods. The first time you rescue a kid, you get lots of personal benefits (feeling good about yourself, being regarded as a hero, etc). By the 37th time, these benefits are played out. If you refuse to rescue a child for the relatively high benefits of a single situation, we think you must have no moral sense at all. But if you fail to rescue them the 37th time, we think this is pretty understandable and similar to what we would do in the same situation.</p><p>(This &#8220;declining marginal utility&#8221; explanation is less natural than something like &#8220;the obligation to rescue all those children is ruining my life&#8221;. But I think it&#8217;s more accurate; if we come up with a thought experiment where it doesn&#8217;t ruin your life in any way - where it only takes a few hours from your day and you have enough left to accomplish everything you need - then it still seems harsh to demand someone rescue 37 children every day. And when there is an actual moral obligation - like parenting your own children - we don&#8217;t accept &#8220;it will ruin my life&#8221; as an excuse to get out of it.)</p><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>So these two descriptive theories - the Copenhagen hypothesis, and the declining marginal utility of moral goods - do a good job explaining our intuitions.</p><p>But some people leap from there to saying they&#8217;re also the right <em>prescriptive</em> theories - they determine what morality <em>really is</em>, and what rules we should follow.</p><p>I think this is a gigantic error, the worst thing you could possibly do in this situation. These are essentially rules for looking good to other people. To follow them is to say that you will always optimize for seeming cool, no matter how many people you have to kill in order to do it. So for example: </p><blockquote><p>Because of Copenhagen hypothesis, you decide it&#8217;s morally wrong to go to the cabin - by &#8220;touching&#8221; the situation, you would be accepting blame for all of the drowning children.</p><p>But you really want a vacation away from your polluted city, and you can&#8217;t afford any other vacation home, so you&#8217;re always looking for some way to solve the problem. One day, you encounter a man with a giant truck. He says that for $525, he could uproot your cabin, load it on his truck, and deposit it on unoccupied land near a small camp a few miles away. In this new location, you couldn&#8217;t hear the children screaming. In fact, there are some other cabins at the camp, none of them ever think about the death river, and nobody ever blames them for it. </p><p>You&#8217;re pretty excited about this. But you hear that your wife&#8217;s sister&#8217;s friend&#8217;s niece has  a rare disease that would cost exactly $525 to cure (and she is poor, and can&#8217;t afford it). Normally you wouldn&#8217;t care much about someone so distant from you. But your wife asks - hey, isn&#8217;t it sort of hypocritical to move the cabin &#8220;in order to be a moral person&#8221;, when you&#8217;re in fact not helping anyone in any way? Wouldn&#8217;t it <em>actually</em> make you more of a moral person to spend the $525 curing her sister&#8217;s friend&#8217;s niece, then vacation at the cabin using earplugs to not hear the screaming kids (which wouldn&#8217;t result in any more kids dying than not going to the cabin, or moving the cabin)?</p></blockquote><p>This is all awkward enough that maybe you want to push the Copenhagenness back a step and just refuse to touch the cabin at all. Refuse to inherit it, lock your door, tell the lawyer who says you own it now that he needs to get off your property or else you&#8217;ll shoot. But we can <em>still</em> make your life difficult:</p><blockquote><p>You live in a house in the suburbs. You never even considered living in a cabin in the woods. However, the nearby semi-magical megacity plans to build a dam. This would rearrange its various internal waterways so that all the drowning children would get carried by the current through your backyard; you would be in the exact same situation as the cabin owner. All of your life savings are tied up in your mortgage, the mere threat of this dam has crashed the value of your house, and you can&#8217;t afford to move. Luckily, a lobbyist owes you a favor. She offers to repay you in one of two ways.</p><p>First, she could lobby the megacity to redirect the dam; this would cause the drowning children to go somewhere else - they would be equally dead, but it&#8217;s not your problem. </p><p>Second, she could lobby the megacity to hire a part-time lifeguard (full-time is beyond her power), who could save half the drowning children. This still ruins your life (a drowning child passes your house once every two hours), and still crashes your home value to zero, but thousands of children would be saved per year. Also, she has a side business as a handyman, and could install double-pane glass windows on your house so you couldn&#8217;t hear the children screaming.</p></blockquote><p>The Copenhagen theorist would be in a bind here. You really want to avoid the dam forcing you to &#8220;touch&#8221; the situation, and then either spend your whole life saving children, or be culpable for failing to do so. But it seems both heartless and pointless to waste your one lobbyist favor on a river redirection which doesn&#8217;t change anything about the real world (as many children will die as ever) when you could instead use it to do lots of good.</p><p>My best bet for how a thoughtful Copenhagener would respond is that they would say you had terrible moral luck by happening to end up where the dam was going to redirect the drowning children; however, this itself caused you to &#8220;touch on&#8221; the situation and now you can be judged for how you respond (including your cowardly response of trying to redirect the river somewhere else).</p><p>I don&#8217;t buy it.</p><blockquote><p>Unfortunately, the lobbyist dies of a heart attack before you can call in <em>either</em> favor. The dam is built and the children pass by your house. You save one per day, but not all of them.</p><p>You have a neighbor. The neighbor lives far enough away that the river doesn&#8217;t affect him at all; he couldn&#8217;t hear the children in any case. </p><p>When you tell him this story, he calls you a monster - how could you only help one child per day?</p><p>You agree this is inadequate, and decide to hire a lifeguard yourself to solve the problem. You offer to split the costs with your neighbor: you will pay 80%, he&#8217;ll pay 20%.</p><p>The neighbor says haha, no way, he&#8217;s not going to waste 20% of his money helping some kids he has no relationship with. But he also thinks you&#8217;re a monster unless <em>you</em> pay the money.</p><p>God notices there is one extra spot in Heaven, and plans to give it to either you or your neighbor. He knows that you jump in the water and save one child per day, and your neighbor (if he were in the same situation) would save zero. He also knows that you are willing to pay 80% of the cost of a lifeguard, and your neighbor (who makes exactly the same amount of money as you) would pay 0%. However, in reality, the river and the drowning children are going by your house, not your neighbor&#8217;s house. Which of you should get the spot in Heaven?</p></blockquote><p>Here it seems obvious that you are a better person than your neighbor. But then what remains of the &#8220;moral luck&#8221; explanation? What remains of Copenhagen, where you are blamed for a situation if you touch it?</p><p>Maybe you have to <em>choose</em> to touch it for it to count? But this seems false; in Singer&#8217;s original drowning child experiment, you didn&#8217;t choose to be the only person near the lake when the kid was drowning. It was just a weird coincidence.</p><p>In fact, it seems like we all benefit from the same sort of moral luck as the neighbor. Suppose Alice is born in a gated community in the US, to a family making $200,000/year; she goes to her local college, stays in her rich hometown, and eventually makes $200,000/year herself. There are no poor people near her, so she has few moral obligations. But Bob is born in Zimbabwe, to a rare upper-class well-connected Zimbabwean family making $200,000 year; he inherits his father&#8217;s business and also makes $200,000 year himself. But he lives in the middle of horrible poverty. His housekeeper is dying of some easily-cured disease, all of his school friends are dying of easily-cured diseases, every day when he goes to work he has to walk over half-dead people screaming for help. It seems like Alice got lucky by not being Bob; she has no moral obligations, whereas he has many. Suppose that Bob only helps a little bit, enough that we would consider him pretty stingy given his situation - maybe he helps his absolute closest school friend, but lets several other school friends die. And suppose that if Alice was in Bob&#8217;s situation, she would do even <em>less</em>, but in fact in real life she satisfies all of her (zero) moral obligations. If there&#8217;s only one spot in Heaven, should it go to Alice or Bob?</p><p>Someone who&#8217;s still desperately trying to preserve Copenhagen would have to say that the &#8220;one spot in Heaven&#8221; prompt isn&#8217;t fair - God presumably has His own criteria which exploit His perfect omniscience, but we humans must think about morality on a merely human level. I still don&#8217;t buy it. For one thing, God isn&#8217;t using any special omniscient knowledge that we (the people reading this thought experiment) don&#8217;t also have and use easily.  For another, if you&#8217;re even slightly religious, actually getting the literal spot in Heaven should be one of the top things on your mind when you&#8217;re deciding whether to be moral or not. Even if you&#8217;re atheist, trying to be the sort of person who <em>would</em> get a spot in Heaven, if it existed, seems like a worthier goal than whatever the Copenhagen-follower is doing.</p><p><strong>IV.</strong></p><p>So again, the question is - what is the right prescriptive theory that doesn&#8217;t just <em>explain</em> moral behavior, but would let us feel dignified and non-idiotic if we followed it?</p><p>My favorite heuristic for thinking about this is John Rawls&#8217; &#8220;original position&#8221; - if we were all pre-incarnation angelic intelligences, knowing we would go to Earth and become humans but ignorant of which human we would become, what deals would we strike with each other to make our time on Earth as pleasant as possible? So for example, we would probably agree not to commit rape, because we wouldn&#8217;t know if we would be the offender or the victim, and we would expect rape to hurt the victim more than it helped the offender.</p><p>Here we would probably agree to save drowning children, because if we were involved in the situation at all, we would have a 50% chance of being the rescuer (minor inconvenience) or the child themselves (life or death importance). </p><p>But we would also agree to save people dying of easily-cured diseases in the Third World, because we wouldn&#8217;t know if we would be those people either. Everyone would agree to a proposed deal that rich people donate a small fraction of their income to charity, because it would be only a mild inconvenience if they turned out to be rich, but a life-saver if they turned out to be poor.</p><p>Further, since we wouldn&#8217;t know whether we would be Alice (low level of moral obligation) or Bob (very high level of moral obligation), we would take out insurance by agreeing that everyone needed to pay the same modest amount into the general pot for helping people. </p><p>(How much should they pay? Enough to pick the low-hanging fruit and make it so nobody is desperately poor, but not enough to make global capitalism collapse. I think the angelic intelligences would also consider that rich people could defect on the deal after being born, and so try to make the yoke as light as possible.)</p><p>A final deal might look like this: we&#8217;ll all cooperate by sending a bit of our money to a general pot for helping people in terrible situations. And if there&#8217;s a more urgent situation that group contributions can&#8217;t help - because for example a child is drowning right now and there&#8217;s only one person close enough to save them - then we&#8217;ll deputize that one person to save them, and assume it will all even out in the end.</p><p>(Actually, even better would be pay that person a reward for their trouble out of the general pot - then there&#8217;s no unfairness or special obligation on one person rather than another!)</p><p>Here we&#8217;re able to bring back all of those things we rejected earlier - proximity, urgency, being the only person available - not because they determine who is worthy of being saved, but in the context of a coalition that plans to save <em>everybody</em> but which in an emergency needs to act through whoever is available. This is no different from a police force which, learning of a serious crime in progress, asks the officer closest to the site to respond, even if that officer isn&#8217;t a specialist in that particular type of crime, or even if that officer is one minute away from clocking out and it&#8217;s unfair to make them work overtime.</p><p>All of this makes perfect sense - except that the coalition is in arrears, there is no general pot, and most bad things go unprevented. Only the extra &#8220;save people close to you&#8221; rule, tacked on as an afterthought, still functions, because that one makes people look good when they do it and is easier to enforce through reputational mechanisms.</p><p>I think you should probably still save someone close to you (eg drowning), partly because this rule is valuable even on its own (ie it&#8217;s better to do it than not do it), and partly because, since other people are following it, you actually have a reciprocal obligation to your fellow coalition members here (ie you expect that if your child was drowning, someone else would help, so you&#8217;re free-riding if you don&#8217;t help them).</p><p>If you end up at the death cabin, you don&#8217;t have an obligation to save every single child who passes by, because the coalition didn&#8217;t intend for the &#8220;save drowning children&#8221; obligation to be an unusual burden on anyone in particular, and because nobody else is doing this so you&#8217;re not betraying fellow coalition members. People may incorrectly think less of you if you don&#8217;t do this, and you might want to take action to avoid reputational damage, but this isn&#8217;t a moral obligation. The real answer to this problem is that the coalition should split the cost of hiring a lifeguard - or, if for some reason you are the only person who can be in the area, compensate you for your time. Given that the coalition isn&#8217;t strong enough to actually do these things, your obligations are limited, and not made any better or worse by living in the cabin vs. further away.</p><p>I think it&#8217;s virtuous, but not obligatory, to behave as if the coalition is still intact, and try to give a portion of your income to some sort of virtual version of the general pot. You could also think of the government as some sort of very distorted flawed real-life version of the coalition and consider your obligations fulfilled by paying taxes, but I think this is an insult to the angelic intelligences, and you should just go with whatever seems like the closest thing to their original plan without waiting for it to actually be instantiated.</p><p>I think this is more dignified than the thing where you try to hire someone for $525 to move your cabin to a different location so you don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re &#8220;touching&#8221; the problem, or whatever.</p>"

We&rsquo;ll also explore the sorts of mechanisms that tend to work poorly</li> <li>How to adjust your approach to operations if you are in an engineering role rather than an executive role</li>",
