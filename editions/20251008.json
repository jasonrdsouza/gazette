The thing about this dankery is that we don&rsquo;t really understand it. I mean, hold on, we know what the memes mean technically. We just don&rsquo;t get why they&rsquo;re funny.</p>\n\n<p>However, in pushing back on them, we&rsquo;re up against two powerful forces:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The dank memes appear to perform better than the stuff we ourselves write on Twitter.\n</li><li>We are reliably informed by our zoomer children that we are too cringe to be trusted on these matters.\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the phish Kurt got:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A pretty-plausible Twitter alert\" src=\"https://fly.io/blog/kurt-got-got/assets/phish.png?2/3&amp;center\" /></p>\n\n<p>Diabolical. Like a scalpel expertly wielded against Kurt&rsquo;s deepest <a href=\"https://theonion.com/cool-dad-raising-daughter-on-media-that-will-put-her-en-1819572981/\" title=\"\">middle-aged-dude</a> insecurity. Our ruthless attackers clinically designed this email to trigger an autonomic Kurt response: &ldquo;oh, what the fuck is this, and why did we post it?&rdquo;</p>\n<div class=\"right-sidenote\"><p>ATO is cool-kid for \u201cgot owned\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<p>I&rsquo;m getting a little ahead of the story here. We knew our X.com account had suffered an ATO because a bunch of us simultaneously got another email saying that the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/flydotio\" title=\"\">@flydotio</a> account&rsquo;s email address now pointed to <code>achilles19969@gmail.com</code>. Our immediate response was to audit all accesses to the login information in <a href=\"https://1password.com/\" title=\"\">1Password</a>, to cut all access for anybody who&rsquo;d recently pulled it; your worst-case assumption in a situation like this is that someone&rsquo;s endpoint has been owned up.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, nobody lost access for very long. I called Kurt to let him know why he was being locked out, and 5 seconds later, he&rsquo;d <a href=\"https://archive.is/6rVqf\" title=\"\">realized what had happened.</a> <strong class=\"font-semibold text-navy-950\">Don&rsquo;t click anything there.</strong></p>\n<h2 class=\"group flex items-start whitespace-pre-wrap relative mt-14 sm:mt-16 mb-4 text-navy-950 font-heading\" id=\"why-it-worked\"><a class=\"inline-block align-text-top relative top-[.15em] w-6 h-6 -ml-6 after:hash opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-all\" href=\"https://fly.io/blog/feed.xml#why-it-worked\"></a><span class=\"plain-code\">Why It Worked</span></h2>\n<p>That&rsquo;s the right question to ask, isn&rsquo;t it? How could this have been possible in the first place?</p>\n\n<p>Contrary to one popular opinion, you don&rsquo;t defeat phishing by training people not to click on things. I mean, tell them not to, sure! But eventually, under continued pressure, everybody clicks. <a href=\"https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~grantho/papers/oakland2025_phishing-training.pdf\" title=\"\">There&rsquo;s science on this</a>. The cool kids haven&rsquo;t done phishing simulation training in years.</p>\n\n<p>What you&rsquo;re supposed to do instead is use phishing-resistant authentication. This is almost the whole backstory for <a href=\"https://www.imperialviolet.org/tourofwebauthn/tourofwebauthn.html\" title=\"\">U2F,  FIDO2</a> and <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/102195\" title=\"\">Passkeys</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Phishing-resistant authentication works by mutual authentication (or, if you&rsquo;re a stickler, by origin- and channel-binding). Phishes are malicious proxies for credentials. Modern MFA schemes like FIDO2 break that proxy flow; your browser won&rsquo;t send real credentials to the fake site.</p>\n<div class=\"right-sidenote\"><p>there\u2019s more to it than this, but, broad strokes.</p>\n</div>\n<p>This is, in fact, how all of our infrastructure is secured at Fly.io; specifically, we get <a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/soc2-the-screenshots-will-continue-until-security-improves/#what-soc2-made-us-do\" title=\"\">everything behind an IdP</a> (in our case: Google&rsquo;s) and have it require phishing-proof MFA. You&rsquo;re unlikely to phish your way to viewing logs here, or to refunding a customer bill at Stripe, or to viewing infra metrics, because all these things require an SSO login through Google.</p>\n\n<p>Twitter, on the other hand. Yeah, so, about that. You may have heard that, a few years back, there were some goings-on involving Twitter. Many of us at Fly.io <a href=\"https://hachyderm.io/@flydotio\" title=\"\">decamped for Mastodon</a>, and <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:j7herf6n4xiig2yg7fqdmkci\" title=\"\">later to Bluesky.</a> There was a window of time in 2023-2024 where it looked as if Twitter might not be a long term thing for us at all.</p>\n<div class=\"right-sidenote\"><p>\u2020 (to whom I sincerely apologize for having assumed they had been owned up and were the proximate cause of the hack)</p>\n</div>\n<p>As a result, Twitter had been a sort of legacy shared account for us, with credentials managed in 1Password and shared with our zoomer contractor\u2020.</p>\n\n<p>Which is why Kurt was in a position to pull credentials from 1Password and log in to members-x.com in response to an email from alerts-x.com.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><p>Still: we could have dodged this attack with hygiene: Kurt complains that \u201cx.com\u201d is an extremely phishable domain, and, sure, but also: the 1Password browser plugin would have noticed that \u201cmembers-x.com\u201d wasn\u2019t an \u201cx.com\u201d host.</p>\n</div><h2 class=\"group flex items-start whitespace-pre-wrap relative mt-14 sm:mt-16 mb-4 text-navy-950 font-heading\" id=\"what-took-so-long\"><a class=\"inline-block align-text-top relative top-[.15em] w-6 h-6 -ml-6 after:hash opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-all\" href=\"https://fly.io/blog/feed.xml#what-took-so-long\"></a><span class=\"plain-code\">What Took So Long</span></h2>\n<p>The attacker immediately revoked all tokens and set up new 2FA, so while we were quickly able to reset our password, we couldn&rsquo;t lock them out of our account without an intervention from X.com, which took something like 1 5 hours to set up.</p>\n\n<p>(That&rsquo;s not a knock on X.com; 15 hours for a 2FA reset isn&rsquo;t outside industry norms).</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re obviously making a lot of noise about this now, but we were pretty quiet during the incident itself (beyond just &ldquo;We know. We knew 45 seconds after it happened. We know exactly how it happened. It&rsquo;s just a Twitter thing.&rdquo;)</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s because, in the grand scheme of things, the attack was pretty chill: <a href=\"https://archive.is/PTO2M\" title=\"\">a not-very-plausible crypto scam</a> that presumably generated $0 for the attackers, 15+ hours of <code>brand damage</code>, and extra security engineering cycles burnt on watchful waiting. Our users weren&rsquo;t under attack, and the account wasn&rsquo;t being used to further intercept customer accounts. At one point, the attackers apparently deleted our whole Twitter history, which, like, don&rsquo;t threaten us with a good time. So we let it roll, until we got our account recovered the next morning.</p>\n<h2 class=\"group flex items-start whitespace-pre-wrap relative mt-14 sm:mt-16 mb-4 text-navy-950 font-heading\" id=\"the-moral-of-the-story-is\"><a class=\"inline-block align-text-top relative top-[.15em] w-6 h-6 -ml-6 after:hash opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-all\" href=\"https://fly.io/blog/feed.xml#the-moral-of-the-story-is\"></a><span class=\"plain-code\">The Moral Of The Story Is</span></h2><div class=\"right-sidenote\"><p>\u201cReally the biggest takeaway for me is that Kurt reads his email.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<p>Obviously Kurt loses his commit access. The time comes in the life of every CEO, and now it comes for him. </p>\n\n<p>Also, we&rsquo;ll finally have a population sample for &ldquo;incident response&rdquo; in <a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/soc2-the-screenshots-will-continue-until-security-improves/\" title=\"\">our next SOC2</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll post more on Twitter. Or maybe we&rsquo;ll double down on Zoomer memes. I don&rsquo;t know. Social media is really weird right now. Either way: our Twitter access is Passkeys now.</p>\n<div class=\"right-sidenote\"><p>seriously don\u2019t click anything on that page</p>\n</div>\n<p>If you were inclined to take us up on an &ldquo;airdrop&rdquo; to &ldquo;claim a share&rdquo; of the &ldquo;token&rdquo; powering Fly.io, the site is <a href=\"https://archive.is/PTO2M\" title=\"\">still up</a>. You can connect your wallet it it! You&rsquo;ll lose all your money. But if we&rsquo;d actually done an ICO, you&rsquo;d have lost all your money anyways.</p>\n\n<p>Somebody involved in pulling this attack off had to come up with &ldquo;own a piece of the sky!&rdquo;, and I think that&rsquo;s punishment enough for them.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever you&rsquo;re operating that isn&rsquo;t behind phishing-resistant MFA, or, better yet, an SSO IdP that requires phishing-resistant MFA: that thing is eventually going to get phished. Dance around the clown-fire of our misfortune if you must, but let us be a lesson to you as well.</p>"

Given the long cycle, I have done my best to check for changes but things may have changed on any given topic by the time you read this.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The NEPA Problem</h4>\n\n\n<p>NEPA is a constant thorn in the side of anyone attempting to do anything.</p>\n<p>A certain kind of person responds with: \u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p>That kind of person does not want humans to do physical things in the world.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>They like the world as it is, or as it used to be.</li>\n<li>They do not want humans messing with it further.</li>\n<li>They often also think humans are bad, and should stop existing entirely.\n<div>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-24772\"></span>\n\n\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>Or believe humans deserve to suffer or do penance.</li>\n<li>Or do not trust people to make good decisions and safeguard what matters.</li>\n<li>To them: If humans want to do something to the physical world?</li>\n<li>That intention is highly suspicious.</li>\n<li>We probably should not let them do that.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is in sharp contrast with the type of person who:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cares about the environment.</li>\n<li>Who wants good things rather than bad to happen to people.</li>\n<li>Who wants the Earth not to boil and the air to be clean and so on.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That person notices that NEPA long ago started doing more harm than good.</p>\n<p>The central problem lies is the core structure.</p>\n<p>NEPA is based on following endlessly expanding procedural requirements. NEPA does not ask whether costs exceed benefits, or whether something is a good idea.</p>\n<p>It only asks about whether procedure was followed sufficiently, or whether blame can be identified somewhere.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Full NEPA Solution</h4>\n\n\n<p>Is to never go full NEPA.</p>\n<p>Instead, one of Balsa\u2019s central policy goals is an entire reimagining of NEPA.</p>\n<p>The proposal is to replace NEPA\u2019s procedural requirement with (when necessary) an analysis of costs and benefits, followed by a vote of stakeholders on whether to proceed. Ask the right question, whether the project is worthwhile, not the wrong question of what paperwork is in order.</p>\n<p>This post is not about laying out that procedure. This post is mostly about telling various Tales From the NEPA. It is also telling tales of energy generation from around the world, including places that do not share our full madness.</p>\n<p>Versions and components of this post have been in my drafts for a long time, so not all of them will be as recent as is common here.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Other Full NEPA Solution</h4>\n\n\n<p>That was the plan, but the vibes have changed, and NEPA is pretty clearly a large net negative for climate change, which has to win in a fight at this point over the local concerns it protects. There\u2019s a new plan.</p>\n<p>Kill it. Repeal NEPA. Full stop.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/eshear/status/1877388330548998603\">Emmett Shear</a>: Previously I believed that there was probably enough protection offered by NEPA / CEQA that it offset the damage. At this point, it\u2019s pretty clear we should simply repeal it and figure out if we need to replace anything later.</p>\n<p>Repeal NEPA.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/elidourado/status/1877061236610806227\">Eli Dourado</a>: NEPA is the most harmful law in the United States and must be repealed. In addition to causing forest fires and miring Starbase in litigation, it results in delays and endless litigation for any project that the federal government touches. It should be target #1 for DOGE.</p>\n<p>Sadly this is not yet within the Overton window of relevant Congressional staff. We need to make this happen.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The problem is DOGE is working via cutting off payments, which doesn\u2019t let you hit NEPA. But if you want to strike a blow that matters? This is it.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meanwhile</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/senatorshoshana/status/1881703774038937979\">Thomas Hochman</a>: Trump has revoked Carter&#8217;s 1977 EO \u2013 the one that empowered CEQ to issue binding NEPA regulations.</p>\n<p>This could dramatically reshape how federal agencies conduct NEPA reviews. In the post-Marin Audobon landscape, this is a HUGE deal!</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s walk through a few of the specifics.</p>\n<p>CEQ will formally propose repealing the existing NEPA regulations that have guided agencies since the late 1970s.</p>\n<p>This is major: those regs currently supply the standard NEPA procedures (e.g., EIS format, \u201cmajor federal action,\u201d significance criteria, scoping, etc.).</p>\n<p>Rescinding them will leave agencies free to adopt leaner, agency-specific processes\u2014or rely on new guidance.</p>\n<p>CEQ will lead a \u201cworking group\u201d composed of representatives from various agencies.</p>\n<p>This group\u2019s job is to develop or revise each agency\u2019s own NEPA procedures so that they\u2019re consistent with the new (post-rescission) approach.</p>\n<p>As I wrote in Green Tape, establishing this internal guidance at the agency level will be crucial.</p>\n<p>And finally: general permits and permits-by-rule!!!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/elidourado/status/1881557328677437792\">Eli Dourado</a>: NEPA is still there but CEQ\u2019s authority to issue regs is gone (and was already under dispute in the courts). NEPA the statute still applies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1881548589589315800\">Cremieux</a>: Some pretty major components of permitting reform on day one might be the biggest news in the day one EOs.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s trillions in value in these EOs.</p>\n<p>I am delighted.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You love to see it. This day one move gave me a lot of hope things would go well, alas other things happened that were less good for my hopes.</p>\n<p>As with everything Trump Administration, we will see what actually happens once the lawyers get involved. This is not an area where \u2018ignore the law and simply do things\u2019 seems likely to work out. Some of it will stick, but how much?</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h4>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Yay Nuclear Power</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/01/nuclear-deregulation.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=nuclear-deregulation\">Yay nuclear deregulation, yes obviously</a>, Alex Tabarrok opens with \u2018yes, I know how that sounds\u2019 but actually it sounds great if you\u2019re familiar with the current regulations.

As usual I remain skeptical of big impacts, but it would not take much to reach a tipping point. As the same post notes when discussing the reactors in Georgia, once you relearn what you are doing things get a lot better and cheaper.</p>\n<blockquote><p>That pair of reactors, which just came online last month at the Alvin W.

(Whereas CEQA is still about &#8220;physical environment&#8221;&#8211;even in the infamous Berkeley case.</p>\n<p>The bill creates utterly open-ended authority for fed. agencies to demand a &#8220;community benefit agreement&#8221; as price of any permit for which an EIS was prepared. This converts NEPA from procedural statute into grant of substantive reg / exaction authority.</p>\n<p>In exercising the &#8220;community benefit agreement&#8221; authority, what is a federal agency supposed to consider? Consideration #1 is the deepness of the permit-applicant&#8217;s pocket. Seriously.</p>\n<p>And in case the new, expansive definition of &#8220;enviro impact&#8221; wasn&#8217;t clear enough, the bill adds that CBAs may be imposed to offset any *social or economic* (as well as enviro) impacts of the project.</p>\n<p>The bill would also destroy the caselaw that limits scope of enviro review to scope of agency&#8217;s regulatory discretion, not only via the CBA provision but also by expressly requiring analysis of effects &#8220;not within control of any federal agency.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And the bill would send a torrent of federal dollars into the coffers of groups who&#8217;d exploit NEPA for labor or other side hustles. &#8211; there&#8217;s $3 billion of &#8220;community engagement&#8221; grants to arm nonprofits &amp; others</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>And in case NEPA turned up to 11 isn&#8217;t enough, there&#8217;s also a new, judicially enforceable mandate for &#8220;community impact reports&#8221; if a project may affect an &#8220;environmental justice community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also a wild provision that seems to prevent federal agencies from considering any project alternatives in an EIS unless (a) the alternative would have no adverse impact on any &#8220;overburdened community,&#8221; or (b) it serves a compelling interest *in that community.*</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>One more observation: the bill subtly nudges NEPA toward super-statute status by directing conflicts b/t NEPA &#8220;and any other provision of law&#8221; to be resolved in favor of NEPA.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/moreisdifferent/status/1788977822234452068\">Or we could have black-clad anarchists storming electric vehicle factories</a>, as happened in Tesla\u2019s plant in Berlin.

One example is NYC congestion pricing, which was passed by the legislature in 2019, had a 4,000-page environmental assessment, and is now subject to 5 lawsuits.</p>\n<p>But how can we speed up permitting and make infrastructure less expensive, while still protecting the environment and promoting democratic participation?</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Environmental permitting might be part of why infrastructure is so expensive in the US. Urban transit costs about 3x the rich/middle-income country average and 6x some European countries.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>At the same time, US environmental outcomes aren\u2019t particularly good. Based on the Yale Center for Environmental Law &amp; Policy\u2019s Environmental Performance Index, the US (at 51, just the 25thpercentile) is considerably worse than the OECD average (at 58).</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>So what to do? I have a framework w/ 2 dimensions. 1: Improve the capacity of the executive to decide \u2013 for example, by limiting the power of litigation to delay. 2: Improve the capacity to plan, including by adding broad-based participation. Currently the US is weak along both.</p>\n<p>I propose a \u201cgreen bargain\u201d that strengthens both executive power and capacity, empowering the executive to decide, but coupling that w/ increased capacity to plan, especially in ways that promote broad-based participation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Can we create a win-win-win for:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Efficiency</li>\n<li>Democracy</li>\n<li>The Environment?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Yes, most certainly, in a big way. The current system is horribly inefficient in many ways that benefit neither democracy nor the environment, indeed frequently this problem is harmful to both. If these are the stakeholders, then there any number of reasonable \u2018good governance\u2019 plans one could use.</p>\n<p>So what is the deal proposed? As far as I can tell it is this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Increase executive power over decisions.</li>\n<li>Rise standards required for judicial review and make court challenges harder in various ways &#8211; time limits, standing requirements, limits on later new objections, limits on challenges to negotiated agreements, more categorical exclusions.</li>\n<li>Limits on court injunctions to stop projects.</li>\n<li>Increase executive capacity on all levels of government so they can handle it.</li>\n<li>Improve quality and scope of executive reviews and enhance public participation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do I support all of these proposals on the margin? Absolutely. Most would be good individually, the rest make sense as part of the package.</p>\n<p>Do I think that this should be convincing to a sincere environmentalist, that they should trust that this will lead to good outcomes? Alas, my answer is essentially no, if this was applied universally.</p>\n<p>I do think this should be convincing if it is applied exclusively to green energy projects and complementary infrastructure. If the end goal is solar panels or batteries, and one believes there is a climate crisis, then one should have a strong presumption that this should dominate local concerns and that delays and cost overruns kill projects.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1125992-spider-man\">Here is the other core problem</a>: Many obstructionists do not want better outcomes.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"YOU CAN REWRITE DNA ON THE FLY, AND YOU'RE USING IT TO TURN PEOPLE INTO DINOSAURS?

He comes up with two key findings:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Only about 0.22% of NEPA decisions (1 in 450) face legal challenges</li>\n<li>Less than 1% of NEPA reviews are environmental impact statements (EISs), and about 5% of NEPA reviews are environmental assessments (EAs).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>But in \u201cMeasuring the NEPA Litigation Burden,\u201d Ruple makes the same error that he\u2019s made throughout his <a href=\"https://journals.library.columbia.edu/index.php/cjel/article/view/9479\">work</a> <a href=\"https://dc.law.utah.edu/scholarship/191/\">on</a> <a href=\"https://naturalresources.house.gov/uploadedfiles/testimony_ruple.pdf\">permitting</a>: he takes the average volume of litigation across <em>all </em>NEPA reviews and makes a conclusion about NEPA\u2019s impact on <em>infrastructure in particular.</em> In other words, his denominator is wildly inflated.</p>\n<p>Ruple\u2019s dataset includes NEPA reviews at every level of stringency: categorical exclusions (CatExes), EAs, and EISs. And as Ruple himself points out, around 95% of NEPA reviews are CatExes. This is because NEPA is triggered by almost <em>every federal action</em>, and thus CatExes are required for everything from <a href=\"https://ceq.doe.gov/nepa-practice/categorical-exclusions.html\">federal hiring</a> to, yes, <a href=\"https://x.com/nicholas_bagley/status/1776955844267028761\">picnics</a>.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Their findings are remarkable: solar, pipeline, wind, and transmission projects saw litigation rates of 64%, 50%, 38%, and 31% respectively. The cancellation rates for each of these project types were also extraordinarily high, ranging from 12% to 32%.</p></blockquote>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!85Q2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1fa258ab-5d32-4181-9825-1e7a7f6dcee1_1093x1062.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Barring a rebuttal I do not expect, that seems definitive to me.</p>\n<p>What about the other study?</p>\n<blockquote><p>The basic flaw in Adelman\u2019s analysis is that he sees the low percentage of renewable projects that undergo NEPA as evidence that NEPA isn\u2019t a big deal. In reality, the exact opposite is true.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As in, NEPA is so obnoxious that where there would be NEPA issues, the projects never even get proposed. We only get renewable projects, mostly, where they have sufficient protections from this. Again, this seems definitive to me.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Modest Proposal</h4>\n\n\n<p>My grand solution to NEPA would be to repeal the paperwork and impact statement requirements, and replace them with a requirement for cost-benefit analysis. That is a complex proposal that I am confident would work if done properly, but which I agree is tricky.</p>\n<p>The grander, simpler solution is repeal NEPA first and ask questions later. At this point, I think that\u2019s the play.</p>\n<p>A solution in bewteen those two would perhaps be to change the remedy for failure, so that any little lapse does not stop an entire project.</p>\n<p>This is another approach to the fundamental problem of sacred values versus cost-benefit.</p>\n<p>Right now, we are essentially saying that a wide variety of potential harms are sacred values, that we would not compromise at any price, such that if there is any danger that they might be compromised then that is a full prohibition.</p>\n<p>But of course that is crazy. With notably rare exceptions, that is not how most anything should ever work.</p>\n<p>Thus, an alternative solution is to keep all the requirements in place, and allow all the lawsuits to proceed.</p>\n<p>But we change the remedy from injunctions to damages.</p>\n<p>As in, suppose a group sues you, and says that your project might violate some statute or do harm in some way. Okay, fine. They file that claim, it is now established. You can choose to wait until the claim is resolved, if the claim actually is big enough and plausible enough that you are worried they might win.</p>\n<p>Or, you can convince an insurance company to post a bond for you, covering the potential damages (and let\u2019s say you can get dinged for double or triple the actual harms, more if you \u2018did it on purpose\u2019 and knew you were breaking the rules, in some sense, or something). So you can choose to do the project anyway, without a delay, and if it turns out you messed up or broke the rules and the bill comes due, then you have to pay that bill. And since it is a multiplier, everyone is still ahead.</p>"
