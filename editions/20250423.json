We&apos;ve all been there. Manually fixing those tangled messes? It&apos;s giving... tedious. It&apos;s giving... waste of my precious time. &#x1f629;<br /></p><p>&#x1f680; <strong>Enter rizzler:</strong> Your new AI bestie that actually <em>*gets*</em> Git. This ain&apos;t your grandpa&apos;s merge tool. <code>rizzler</code> slides into your Git workflow and uses &#x2728; AI magic &#x2728; (think OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Bedrock - the whole squad) to automatically resolve those annoying merge conflicts. Less time untangling, more time coding (or scrolling). You&apos;re welcome. &#x1f609;<br /><br />Basically, it turns this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-diff\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\nconst message = &quot;Hello from main branch!&quot;;\n=======\nconst message = &quot;Waddup from feature branch!&quot;;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feature-branch\n</code></pre><p>Into <em>actual</em>, usable code, letting you get back to the important stuff. &#x2728;</p><h3 id=\"%F0%9F%9A%80-get-rizzin-installation\">&#x1f680; Get Rizzin&apos;: Installation</h3><p>Ready to ditch the conflict drama? Let&apos;s get you set up.

It queries the LLMs you have configured (there&apos;s a bundle of strategies within, and I&apos;d <a href=\"https://github.com/ghuntley/rizzler/blob/trunk/CONTRIBUTING.md?ref=ghuntley.com#-where-we-really-need-your-help-resolution-strategies-\">love for folks to send in more</a>)</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img alt=\"rizzler: stop crying over Git merge conflicts and let AI handle the drama\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"1442\" src=\"https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2025/04/Untitled-diagram-2025-04-23-115511.png\" width=\"2000\" /></figure><p>If a file hits eight merge conflicts and can&apos;t crack one, it&apos;ll tackle the rest and send an &quot;oops&quot; back to Git, halting the merge party. That&apos;s your cue to dust off your favourite editor and resolve that stubborn conflict manually&#x2014;throwback style, like it&apos;s 2005. On the bright side, successful fixes get cached on disk, cutting down on LLM costs and giving you a productivity boost&#x2014;no more twiddling thumbs waiting for the LLM to chime in! </p><h2 id=\"ps-socials\">ps. socials</h2><ul><li>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/geoffreyhuntley_rizzler-stop-crying-over-git-merge-conflicts-activity-7320785714051170305-ugaV?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAABQKuUB2AJ059keUcRUVLbtmoa6miLVlTI\">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/geoffreyhuntley_rizzler-stop-crying-over-git-merge-conflicts-activity-7320785714051170305-ugaV</a></li><li>BlueSky: <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/ghuntley.com/post/3lni5qdx3vk2u?ref=ghuntley.com\">https://bsky.app/profile/ghuntley.com/post/3lni5qdx3vk2u</a></li><li>X: <a href=\"https://x.com/GeoffreyHuntley/status/1915030413082583227?ref=ghuntley.com\">https://x.com/GeoffreyHuntley/status/1915030413082583227</a></li></ul><p></p><blockquote>pps: <a href=\"https://x.com/GeoffreyHuntley/status/1915042017710952545?ref=ghuntley.com\">this is a joke</a>. A thought experiment if you will. What if in the future git commits are automatically done by assistants and the commit message contains information that a client such as rizzler could use for injection into the context window? That starts make things interesting fast.
