                "<p><em>This is part 1 of a 3 (or 4, I haven't decided yet) part series on digital hygiene.</em></p>\n<p>Email is, arguably, the backbone of the modern internet. Not only is it a means of communication, but is the de-facto identity for operating online. In this way, email isn't just how I communicate, but who I am online. Yes, some services still operate with usernames and passwords; but the vast majority of services use email as user identity. This arguably makes email the most important online account. Everything else relies on email.</p>\n<p>Email is also where I do most of my work. From technical support, to replying to friendly emails, to receiving invoices; it is the workspace through which my occupation operates. And for all of these reasons, my email is well organised and easy to use.</p>\n<p>People regularly comment on how quickly and personally I respond to their emails, and it's because they're generally only one of a few emails in my inbox. This isn't because I just naturally don't receive emails (I run two B2C web-services!). Instead it is because I am very active in maintaining a clean workspace. In the same way a carpenter keeps his tools neat and tidy; or a barista cleans his equipment and the counter after every coffee brewed; I put away my emails and wipe down my inbox after every use.</p>\n<p>What's fairly interesting, though, is that people assume this is difficult. But it's not. Once I started keeping a clean inbox I actually had significantly less work, since every email I received actually warranted attention. The important ones weren't buried beneath a heap of newsletters, spam, receipts, and all the other cruft that can clog up the workspace.</p>\n<p>Here's how I do it:</p>\n<p>To kick things off, I have 2 email addresses. The first one is the one that I use as my identity. This is a gmail address that I've had since high school, and I use it to sign up to online services, fill in forms, and all the other things that require an online identity. I don't bother with email aliases since it just makes my identity harder to control. I respect people who do this to track data-leaks, but I couldn't be bothered.</p>\n<p>The second email address is my conversational address. This is where people can contact me, whether it be for support or to just say hi. I don't have any web-services or online identities associated with this email address, and so every email I receive here is from a person.</p>\n<p>My email is also not a place for adverts and marketing (we'll get to this later), or a place where I read newsletters. This is a place for work and communication. For newsletters I use an RSS reader (<a href=\"https://reederapp.com\" target=\"_blank\">Reeder</a> is my choice of client). If a website or newsletter doesn't support RSS (which is very rare) and I really want to receive updates I use <a href=\"https://kill-the-newsletter.com\" target=\"_blank\">Kill the Newsletter</a>, which creates an RSS feed of received emails.</p>\n<p>This is one of the most important parts of my email strategy. My inbox isn't a place for leisurely reading. When I open my email it's with purpose. If I want to catch up on my newsletters and blogs I follow, I can flop down on the couch, open my RSS reader, and enjoy them when I'm not also trying to work.</p>\n<p>Since my first email address is used for signing up to websites, apps, and all the rest; it inevitably receives marketing emails (even though I religiously never check that checkbox). Whenever I receive a marketing newsletter I <em>always</em> hit unsubscribe. I'm not interested. If I receive another email from that company I report their email as spam. This is a non-negotiable. Companies that disregard unsubscribes should be penalised, and the only way to do this is to make their email deliverability metrics slightly worse. Maybe they'll learn. Probably not.</p>\n<p>When a new email enters my inbox I explicitly act on it. Every single email is attended to like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If it warrants a reply, reply to it or act on the information.</li>\n<li>If it requires action or mulling over I either create an item on my todo list, or snooze the email for later.</li>\n<li>If it is a marketing email or a newsletter I unsubscribe, or mark as spam and block if they persist.</li>\n<li>If it is a receipt for a subscription, or any other recurring email that I can't block, I set up a filter to auto-archive those emails where I can find them if needed.</li>\n<li>Finally archive it. I archive all of my emails once they're completed, so the inbox only has unread and unattended emails. You can start this by simply selecting all of your emails and archiving them immediately, then follow the above steps going forward.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And I just keep doing that. I found that over time, once the cruft has been unsubscribed, filtered, or moved elsewhere; the only emails that hit my inbox are important ones that require my attention. Additionally, I only receive between 5 and 15 emails a day, and they aren't buried and require significantly less cognitive load to address.</p>\n<p>Naturally everyone's workflow will look different based on the work that they do and personal preference. However I think it is universal to say being active about email creates a better experience for you and the people and services you interact with. This is just how I like to do it.</p>\n<p>It's also possible to control what kinds of emails you receive. If you take a look at my <a href=\"https://herman.bearblog.dev/contact/\" target=\"_blank\">contact page</a>, you'll notice that it's intentionally formatted, and tweaked regularly. I have a big picture of my face to remind people that they're interacting with a human being (this is particularly useful for support requests). It then provides easy links to the most frequently requested resources. I specify my working hours, establishing that people will need to be patient when waiting for a response from me, especially over weekends (this is also particularly useful for support requests). And then finally my email is at the bottom in non-copy-and-paste (and maybe anti-bot) format.</p>\n<p>I encourage people to randomly email me. Especially if it's to discuss a post of mine, invite me for <a href=\"https://herman.bearblog.dev/coffee/\" target=\"_blank\">a coffee</a>, or just open a line of communication. The page is set up to point people in the right direction when looking for information, help them quickly resolve their queries, and to remind them that I'm not a nameless customer support agent.</p>\n<p>I am quite privileged to decide what emails are important, since I work for myself. However, even if you receive a lot of email that can't be filtered out, having a system around what you can archive or unsubscribe from will inevitably make life easier.</p>\n<p>Email is a great tool when used well. It is a place of slow(er) communication, and for some a place for connection. In many ways it is an extension of oneself. I like to keep it tidy.</p>"

Did you know that pre-contact aborigines didn&#8217;t know that sex caused conception? Wait, no, what if they did know it, and were just pretending not to? Wait, no, what if they sort of deliberately suppress the knowledge as a way of defusing paternity conflicts after traditional wife-swapping rituals? Wait, no, what if it&#8217;s racist to accuse aborigines of not understanding something obvious like this? Wait, no, what if it&#8217;s ethnocentric to call Western beliefs &#8220;obvious&#8221;? Wait, no! . . . this comes from a book called <em>Arguments About Aborigines</em>, which I have ordered on the strength of this chapter.</p><p><strong>46:</strong> Wikipedia on the attempt to censor Michelangelo&#8217;s <em>Last Judgment:</em></p><blockquote><p>Because he depicted naked figures, the artist was accused of immorality and obscenity. A censorship campaign (known as the \"Fig-Leaf Campaign\") was organized by [Cardinal] Carafa and Monsignor Sernini (Mantua's ambassador) to remove the frescoes. From this campaign drew support for the more natural state of the figures. In response, phallic imagery began permeating throughout Vatican City, beginning the trend of the crude drawings in places such as in graffiti art in bathrooms, textbooks, and other public places to be easily found. <strong>This trend continues to the present day.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Like the Streisand Effect if people still had some dim memory that there was something about the name &#8220;Streisand&#8221; in the year 2500. And:</p><blockquote><p>The Pope's Master of Ceremonies Biagio da Cesena said \"it was most disgraceful that in so sacred a place there should have been depicted all those nude figures, exposing themselves so shamefully, and that it was no work for a papal chapel but rather for the public baths and taverns.\" In response Michelangelo worked da Cesena's semblance into the scene as Minos, judge of the underworld. It is said that when he complained to the Pope, the pontiff responded that his jurisdiction did not extend to hell, so the portrait would have to remain.</p></blockquote><p><strong>47: </strong>When a couple has a child, everyone knows the woman&#8217;s career suffers more than the man&#8217;s. <a href=\"https://stephaniehmurray.substack.com/p/the-child-penalty-is-mostly-just\">But did you know that this effect comes almost entirely from daughters</a>? (maternal earnings penalty 3% for a son, 26% for a daughter). Commenters suggest that fathers spend more time with sons and vice versa, partly counterbalancing the overall tendency for mothers to spend more time with children. </p><p><strong>48: </strong><a href=\"https://x.com/Scholars_Stage/status/1927487894291202509\">T. Greer on China&#8217;s strategy for invading Taiwan</a>.
