I started a new job at <a href=\"https://githubnext.com/\">Github Next</a> at the beginning of October; a team tasked with researching and building the next generation of tools for software developers. Which at this point in history unquestionably means agents.</p>\n<p>It's hard to think of historical parallels where a field changed this rapidly in such an unrelenting and distributed way. Even Andrej Karpathy <a href=\"https://x.com/karpathy/status/2004607146781278521?s=20\">feels behind</a></p>\n<p>I am not trying to add to the hype and FOMO here. Only to be honest about what it feels like inside my particular information bubble. I am becoming a product of my X feed, which is unintentionally finely tuned to show an infinite stream of developer-flavoured AI panic anxiety that looks something like this:</p>\n<p>You might suggest that I spend less time on X, but I'm not inclined to look away just as the train gets up to full speed. Sure it's a distorted reality, but it points to real ground truth: even if progress on language models slows this year, we are still far behind in using what already exists to reshape software design and engineering.</p>\n<p>To be clear, I am tired, but thrilled by the capabilities overhang. No one has the full context of what is happening around us. Pick any piece of it to work on in earnest and you'll find bushels of low hanging fruit.</p>\n<p>I am not a resolutions person, but it's hard to enter a new year without stopping to take stock and strategise a bit. My policy for the first year of my kid's life is that I get a free pass at everything; eating too many chocolate Hobnobs? Free pass. Not reading enough books? Free pass. Haven't cleared out that pile of crap in the hallway? Free pass. This excuses me from most new-years-shaped personal improvement goals.</p>\n<p>But the one thing I've lost over the last nine months that I urgently need to find again is my belief that anything I write matters. It's been hard to know what to say with a landscape changing this fast. It's hard to gather my thoughts in a resource depleted state. It's hard to believe my opinions have any legitimacy compared to the people working inside the foundation labs, while I scramble together information in between 3am feeds and nursery runs. I've lost a little of my confidence as a researcher and contributor to The Discourse. My intention for this year is to take my own advice and pick some low hanging fruit.</p>"

And what a chance! The last few years of the human era will be wild. They&#8217;ll be like classical Greece and Rome: a sudden opening up of new possibilities, where the first people to take them will be remembered for millennia to come. What a waste of the privilege of living in Classical Athens to try to become the richest olive merchant or whatever. Even in Roman times, trying to become Crassus would be, well, crass. </p><p>In 2014, I wrote <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/10/20/in-the-future-everyone-will-be-famous-to-fifteen-people/\">In The Future Everyone Will Be Famous To Fifteen People</a>. The argument was: suppose humanity ends up occupying millions of galaxies. People will still remember Earth as a special time. The mountainous mass of future historians will press down upon a tiny speck of current people.

A random woman gave Jesus a washcloth to wipe his face on the way to his crucifixion. She is now known as St. Veronica, patroness of laundry workers, and one out of every 2,500 girls in America is named in her honor. She has an annual feast day, approximately one million beautiful Renaissance paintings, a chapel in Jerusalem, and lesser churches all around the world (including one here in San Francisco). The richest olive merchant in Jerusalem that year is long forgotten, but she endures.</p><p>St. Veronica isn&#8217;t unusual in her charity: any one of us might lend a rag to a person in need. She&#8217;s special because she happened to commit her random act of kindness at the crucial - fine, pun <em>sort of</em> intended - moment of religious history, when a tiny speck of recorded happenings must support trillions of person-years of later adoration. If you worry about the &#8220;permanent underclass&#8221; meme, then you already believe we&#8217;re not <em>not</em> at another crucial moment. I&#8217;m not asking you to give up your dreams of owning a bigger moon than everyone else in order to chase a tiny chance of becoming the future&#8217;s equivalent of Jesus. I&#8217;m suggesting you give them up in order to offer the future a washcloth, and see if it honors your memory.</p><p>You have only X years to escape being permanently boring when the weight of galactic humanity descends to scrutinize your life forever. Ten million years from now, do you want transhuman intelligences on a Niven Ring somewhere in Dario Amodei&#8217;s supercluster to briefly focus their deific gaze on your legacy and think &#8220;Yeah, he spent the whole hinge of history making B2B SAAS products because he was afraid of &#8216;joining the permanent underclass&#8217;, now he has a moon 20% bigger than the rest of us?&#8221; Or do you want them to think &#8220;She was one of the heroes who arose when the fate of humanity balanced on a knife&#8217;s edge, fought against the thousand forms of entropy that could have ended our paradise before it began, helped create a vision of broad-based prosperity that benefitted all humanity, and gets 0.000038501% of the credit for our current happy state. We grant her the rank of Forebear, and the Ancestor Veneration And Simulation Collective has built a megacathedral to her memory three star systems over&#8221;?</p><p>I&#8217;m not trying to push you in any direction, honest. If you get everything totally wrong, too bad, but you&#8217;ll still be remembered forever for trying. Even Pontius Pilate has immortality of a sort. Both Eliezer Yudkowsky and Beff Jezos have their page in the textbooks assured. If you&#8217;re a well-off Silicon Valley person, you&#8217;re already well-placed to join them. So participate in the discourse. Create some art. Donate to a cause you believe in. Make a prediction.

The biggest reason for this is actual fertility is also influenced by child mortality, which has fallen a lot since 1960.</p></blockquote>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oyU5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c55b765-6bf5-4d98-acd2-017dd1797b13_693x453.webp\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>So in this model, the question becomes why are desired family sizes falling?</p>\n<p>Lyman thinks this mostly comes down to comparisons with others (he explicitly doesn\u2019t want to use the word \u2018status\u2019 here).</p>\n<p>And his thesis is essentially that people around the world saw European wealth, found themselves \u2018at the bottom\u2019 of a brand-new social scale, and were told to fix this they had to Westernize, and Western culture causes the fertility decline.</p>\n<p>This doesn\u2019t explain where the Western desire for smaller families came from.</p>\n<p>I also don\u2019t think that this is why Western culture was adapted. I think Western culture is more attractive to people in various ways &#8211; it largely wins in the \u2018marketplace of ideas\u2019 when the decisions are up to individuals. Which I think is largely the level at which the decisions are made.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pessimism</h4>\n\n\n<p>People\u2019s severe pessimism, and inability to understand how good we have it, is making all these issues a lot worse.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/benlandautaylor/status/1973451306926055934\">Ben Landau-Taylor</a>: Knowing a decent amount of history will cure lots of fashionable delusions, but none quite so hard as \u201cHow could anyone bring a child into a world as remarkably troubled and chaotic as the year 2025\u201d.</p>\n<p>Matt McAteer: Historical periods with names like \u201cThe Twenty Years\u2019 Anarchy\u201d, \u201cThe Killing Time\u201d, \u201cThe Bronze Age Collapse\u201d\u2026or god forbid, \u201cThe Great Emu War\u201d\u20262025 doesn\u2019t seem so bad by comparison.</p>\n<p>Nested 456: My mother grew up playing in bomb sites in northern England right after WW2. Really we\u2019re spoiled brats in comparison</p></blockquote>\n<p>Are there big downsides and serious issues? Oh, definitely, atomization and lack of child freedoms and forms of affordability are big problems, and AI is a big risk.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Baby Boom</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/baby-boom-seven-charts\">Saloni Dattani and Lucas Rodes-Guirao offer us a fun set of charts</a> about the baby boom, but they don\u2019t offer an explanation for how or why that happened, as Derek Thompson points out <a href=\"https://x.com/DKThomp/status/1894025331851268166\">none of the standard explanations fully line up with the data</a>. A lot of people seem to grasp at various straws in the comments.</p>\n<p>Handy and Shester do offer an explanation for a lot of it, <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/10/the-microfoundations-of-the-baby-boom.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-microfoundations-of-the-baby-boom\">pointing to decline in maternal mortality</a>, saying this explained the majority of increases in fertility. That is certainly an easy story to tell. Having a child is super scary, so if you make it less scary and reduce the health risks you should get a lot more willingness to have more kids.</p>\n<p>Tyler Cowen sees this as a negative for a future baby boom, since maternal mortality is now low enough that you can\u2019t pull this trick again. The opposite perspective is that until the Baby Boom we had this force pushing hard against having kids and people had tons of kids anyway, whereas now it is greatly reduced, so if we solve our other problems we would be in a great spot.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Paperwork</h4>\n\n\n<p>The paperwork issue is highly linked to the safety obsession issues, but also takes on a logic all its own.</p>\n<p>As with car seat requirements, the obvious response is \u2018that\u2019s silly, people wouldn\u2019t not have kids because of that\u2019 but actually no, this stuff is a nightmare, it\u2019s a big cost and stress on your life, it adds up and people absolutely notice. AI being able to handle most of this can\u2019t come soon enough.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/KTmBoyle/status/1915449549327663279\">Katherine Boyle</a>: We don\u2019t talk enough about how many forms you have to fill out when raising kids. Constant forms, releases, checklists, signatures. There\u2019s a reason why litigious societies have fewer children. People just get tired of filling out the forms.</p>\n<p>The forms occasionally matter. But I\u2019ve found you don\u2019t have to fill out the checklists. Pro tip. Throw them away.</p>\n<p>Blake Scholl: I was going to have more children but the paperwork was too much.</p>\n<p>Sean McDonald: It\u2019s shocking how many times I\u2019ve been normied in the circumstance I won\u2019t blindly sign a parent form. People will get like..actually mad if you read them.</p>\n<p>Nathan Mintz: An AI agent to fill out forms for parents &#8211; will DM wiring information later.</p>\n<p>Cristin Culver: It\u2019s 13 tedious steps to reconfirm to my children\u2019s school district that the 13 forms I uploaded last time are still correct. <img alt=\"\ud83e\udd75\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f975.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Car Seats As Contraception</h4>\n\n\n<p>Back in 2022 I wrote an extended analysis on <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/on-car-seats-as-contraception\">car seats as contraception</a>. Prospective parents faced with having to change cars, and having to deal with the car seats, choose to have fewer children.</p>\n<p>People think you can only fit two car seats in most cars. This drives behaviors remarkably strongly, resulting in substantial reductions in birth rates. No, really.</p>\n<p>The obvious solution is that the extent of the car seat requirements are mostly patently absurd, and can be heavily reduced with almost no downsides.</p>\n<p>It turns out there are also ways to put in three car seats, in many cases, using currently available seats, with a little work. That setup is still annoying as hell, but you can do it.</p>\n<p>The improved practical solution is there is a European car seat design that takes this to four car seats across a compact. <a href=\"https://x.com/LeahLibresco/status/1964747798055928299\">It can be done. They have the technology</a>.</p>\n<p>In an even stupider explanation than usual, the problem is that our crash test fixtures that we use cannot physically include a load leg, so we cannot test the four car seat setup formally, so we cannot formally verify that they comply with safety regulations.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Scarlet Astrorum: I know why we can\u2019t have 4 kids to a row in the car and it\u2019s a silly regulatory thing. Currently, US testing protocols do not allow crash testing of U.S. car seats that feature a load leg, similar to the British four-seater Multimac (pictured).</p>\n<p>The crash test fixture itself is designed so it cannot physically include a load leg. The sled test fixture does not have a floor so there is no place to attach a load leg.</p>\n<p>This means safe, multiple-kid carseats used widely in Europe can\u2019t even be *evaluated* for safety- it\u2019s not that they break US safety regulations, they just can\u2019t even attach onto the safety testing sled, which is all seat (also pictured).</p>\n<p>To test the 4-kid carseats which use a load arm, there are already functional test fixtures, like the ECE R129 Dynamic Test Bench, pictured here, which has a floor. We just need to add this as a testing option. Manufacturers could still test with the old sled.</p>\n<p>What needs to change: 49 CFR \u00a7 571.213 s10.1-4 and Figure 1A which lock you in to testing with a floorless sled All that needs to change is updating the wording to clarify test positioning for a sled with a floor as well.</p></blockquote>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FGOZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd05afc7b-08de-44e2-b94c-8420619d736a_1700x1132.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>You would also have to spread the word so people know about this option.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You Can\u2019t Afford It</h4>\n\n\n<p>Of course you are richer than we used to be, <a href=\"https://x.com/ScarletAstrorum/status/1890907223838105966\">but not measured in the cost to adhere to minimal child raising standards</a>, especially housing and supervision standards.</p>\n<blockquote><p>David Holz: i find it so strange when people say they can\u2019t afford kids. your ancestors were able to afford kids for the last 300,000 years! are we *really* less wealthy now? you might think your parents were better off, but how about further back? they still went on.</p>\n<p>Scarlet Astrorum: What people mean when they say this is often \u201cI am not legally allowed to raise children the way my poor ancestors did\u201d</p>\n<p>Personally I only have to go back 2 generations to find behavior that I think is reasonable given circumstances but would be currently legally considered neglect</p>\n<p>\u201cI will not risk the custody of my existing children to raise more children than I can supervise according to today\u2019s strict standards\u201d is unfortunately a very reasonable stance.

If you shrink that number dramatically, the result would be very different, at least in America.</p>\n<p>America has the unique advantage that we want to have children, and like this man we are big mad that we feel unable to have them, usually because of things fungible with money. So we should obviously help people pay for this public good.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Housework</h4>\n\n\n<p>There is the housing theory of everything.<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/02/18/fertility-decline-women-kids-claudia-goldin/\"> Then there\u2019s the housework theory of everything?</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>Heather Long: Goldin concludes that two factors explain much of the downward trend by country: the speed at which women entered the workforce after World War II, and how quickly men\u2019s ideas about who should raise kids and tidy up at home caught up.

The various types of costs are, again presumably, mostly fungible.</p>\n<p>The idea that \u201850-50\u2019 is a magic thing that makes the work go away, or that it seeming fair would take away the barrier, is silly. The problem identified here is too much work, too many costs, that fall on the woman in particular, and also the household in general.</p>\n<p>One can solve that with money, but the way to do it is simply to decrease the necessary amount of work. There used to be tons of housework because it was physically necessary, we did not have washers and dryers and dishwashers and so on. Whereas today, this is about unreasonable standards, and a lot of those standards are demands for child supervision and \u2018safety\u2019 or \u2018enrichment\u2019 that simply never happened in the past.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Greedy Careers</h4>\n\n\n<p>If market labor has increasing returns to scale, <a href=\"https://x.com/RuxandraTeslo/status/1900186033515364405\">then taking time off for a child is going to be expensive in terms of lifetime earnings</a> and level of professional advancement. <a href=\"https://worksinprogress.co/issue/fertility-on-demand/\">Ruxandra\u2019s full article is here,</a> I quote mostly from her thread.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ruxandra Teslo: One\u2019s 30s are a crucial period for professional advancement. Especially in so-called \u201cgreedy careers\u201d: those where returns to longer hours are non-linear.</p>\n<p>But one\u2019s mid 30s is also when most women\u2019s fertility starts to drop.</p>\n<p>In this piece, I lay out how a large part of the \u201cgender pay gap\u201d is just this: a motherhood pay gap. And, as Nobel Laureate Claudia Goldin points out, this is particularly true in high-stakes careers like business, law, medicine, entrepreneurship and so on.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UTxF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef73ce94-5ea7-4731-beb1-955e572ed5f0_900x725.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>This reduction in earnings is not just about money either: it\u2019s about general career advancement and personal satisfaction with one\u2019s profession. Time lost in one\u2019s 30s is hard to recuperate from later on.</p>\n<p>In law, for example, one\u2019s 30s is when the highest levels of salary growth take place. Founders who launch unicorns (startups worth more than a billion dollars) have a median age of 34 when they found their companies. In academia, one\u2019s thirties are usually the time when a researcher goes through a string of high-pressure postdoctoral positions in an attempt to secure an independent position.</p>\n<p>Aware of this, women delay pregnancy until they have advanced in their careers as far as possible. This is especially true for women w/ professional degrees. Women without a bachelor\u2019s degree tend to have 1 to 1.5 children on ~ by age 28, while those with higher educational attainment have around 0.25 children by same age.</p>\n<p>Highly educated women attempt to catch up during their 30s, with their birth rates increasing more rapidly. However, this compensatory period is limited, as fertility rates across all education levels tend to plateau around age 39. Thus, the educated group ends up with less kids.</p>\n<p>The chance of conceiving a baby naturally with regular sex drops from 25 percent per month in one\u2019s twenties to about five percent per month at 40, while the chance of miscarrying rises from about eight percent for women under 30 to around one in three for 40-year-olds.</p>\n<p>[thread continues and morphs into discussing technological fertility solutions]</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://worksinprogress.co/issue/fertility-on-demand/\">From Her Article</a>: Women know this gap exists and plan accordingly: in countries where the motherhood penalty is keenest, the birth rate is <a href=\"https://www.boomcampaign.org/p/the-impact-of-the-child-penalty-on?r=27r4jr&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web\">lower</a>.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>We have come a long way from the explicit sex discrimination of the past. Today, the gap is primarily driven by the career toll exacted by motherhood.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A lot of the problem is our inability to realistically talk and think about the problem.

For many, that takes away a strong reason to have kids.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Grandparents</h4>\n\n\n<p>The New York Times put out an important short article that made people take notice, <a href=\"https://archive.is/b67Kq\">The Unspoken Grief of Never Becoming a Grandparent</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Robert Sterling: I know a huge number of people in their 60s and 70s with one grandchild at most. Many with zero.</p>\n<p>These people had 3-4 kids of their own, and they assumed their kids would do the same. They planned for 10-15 grandkids at this age.</p>\n<p>Not for me to judge, but it\u2019s sad to see.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I have little doubt that those considering having kids are not properly taking into account the grandparent effect, either for their parents or in the future for themselves.</p>\n<p>Throughout, the frame is \u2018of course my children should be able to make their own choices about whether to have kids,\u2019 and yes no one is arguing otherwise, but this risks quickly bleeding into the frame of \u2018no one else\u2019s preferences should factor into this decision,\u2019 which is madness.</p>\n<p>It also frames the tragedy purely in experiential terms, of missing out on the joy and feeling without purpose. It also means your line dies out, which is also rather important, but we\u2019ve decided as a society you are not allowed to care about that out loud.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/webdevMason/status/1856210668736917976\">Mason</a>: I really hope I am able to say whatever I need to say and do whatever I need to do for my children to have some grasp of what a complex and transcendent joy it is to bring a new person into the world.</p>\n<p>My daughter\u2019s great-grandfather is dying at hospice. He is not truly present anymore.</p>\n<p>Even when he was able to first meet her, he was not always fully there.</p>\n<p>But a few times he did recognize me, so he knew who she was, and he would not eat so that he could just watch her toddle around.</p>\n<p>I do not know how to explain it, man. At the very end, when you barely even remember who you are, the newest additions to your lineage hold you completely spellbound.</p>\n<p>He would just stare at her and say, \u201cShe never even cries,\u201d over and over, so softly.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The flip side is that parents, who are prospective grandparents, seem unwilling to push for this. Especially tragic is when they hoard their wealth, leaving their kids without the financial means to have kids. There is an obviously great trade for everyone &#8211; you support them financially so they can have the kids they would otherwise want &#8211; but everyone is too proud or can\u2019t admit what they want or wants them to \u2018make it on their own\u2019 or other such nonsense.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/AudreyPollnow/status/1856411205067321738\">Audrey Pollnow has extensive thoughts</a>.</p>\n<p>I appreciated this part of her framing: Having kids is now \u2018opt-in,\u2019 which is great, except for two problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We\u2019ve given people such high standards for when they should feel permission to opt-in. Then if they do go forward anyway, it is common to mostly refuse to help.</li>\n<li>Because it is opt-in, there\u2019s a feeling that the kids are therefore not anyone else\u2019s responsibility, only the parents, at least outside an emergency. Shirking that responsibility hurts the prospect of having grandparents, as any good or even bad decision theorist knows, and thus does not improve one\u2019s life or lineage.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://radiopaper.com/conversation/2sL5a68lCw4t\">I do not agree with her conclusion</a> that therefore contraception, which enables us to go to \u2018opt-in,\u2019 is bad actually.

We have no hesitations talking about the downsides, but we do hesitate on the upsides, and we especially hesitate to point out the negative consequences of not having kids.

Contrary to popular myth, South Korean pro-parent subsidies have not been very large, and relative to their modest size, they have been fairly successful.</p>\n<p>\u2026 In South Korea, mothers\u2019 employment falls by 49 percent relative to fathers, over ten years \u2013 62 percent init\u00adially, then rising as their child ages.

The effect appears to be the result of a real increase in births, rather than a shift in the timing of births.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/patio11/status/1999300123382489565\">Patrick McKenzie</a>: I don\u2019t think I had clocked \u201cThe nation we presently understand to be South Korea has opted to cease existing.\u201d until WIP phrased baked-in demographic decline in the first sentence here.</p>\n<p>Think we wouldn\u2019t have many lawyers or doctors if we decided \u201cWell we tried paying lawyers $22k once, that didn\u2019t work, guess money can\u2019t be turned into lawyers and that leaves me fresh out of ideas.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you ask for a $270k expense, and offer $22k in subsidy, that helps, but not much.</p>\n<p>The result here is actually pretty disappointing, and implies a cost much larger than that in America. The difference is that in America we want to have more kids and can\u2019t afford them, whereas in South Korea they mostly don\u2019t want more kids and also can\u2019t afford them. That makes it a lot harder to make progress purely with money.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s plausible that this would improve with scale. If the subsidy was $30k initially and then $15k per year for 18 years, so you can actually pay all the expenses (although not the lost time), that completely changes the game and likely causes massive cultural shifts. The danger would be if those funds were then captured by positional competition, especially private tuition and tutoring, so you\u2019d need to also crack down on that in this cultural context. My prediction is if you did both of those it would basically work, but that something like that is what it would take.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/01/south-korea-fact-of-the-day-5.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=south-korea-fact-of-the-day-5\">2024 was the first year since 2015 that total births increased in South Korea</a>, by 3.1%, which of course is not anything remotely like enough.</p>\n<p>Robin Hanson points us to this article called The End of Children, mostly highlighting <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/03/03/the-population-implosion\">the horror show that is South Korea</a> when it comes to raising children.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://conversableeconomist.com/2025/05/05/koreas-low-fertility-rate/\">Timothy Taylor takes a shot at looking for why South Korea\u2019s fertility is so low</a>, nothing I haven\u2019t covered before.

It would be much better to offer this money as an expanded child tax credit and let families decide how to spend that, including the option to only have one income.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kazakhstan</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/TothGCsaba/status/1958909909883322587\">Kazakhstan remains the existence proof that fertility</a> <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10680-023-09671-6#Tab1\">can recover</a>, with economic recovery and growth boosting seemingly rather than hurting fertility as they recovered from the economic woes they experienced in the 1990s.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3-Tr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b1a28bd-1270-4087-8034-1f0ae45f3725_552x524.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Israel</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/MoreBirths/status/1870911221630685465\">More Births looks into how Israeli fertility remains so high</a>. \u200b</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YuAP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a433237-c61b-437a-b6ef-c6923f94d93e_900x722.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<blockquote><p>More Births: On the combined measures of income and fertility, one nation is far ahead of the rest.

Israel is the only country in the world that does well in both categories.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Israel has high levels of education. It has high housing costs. It has existential threats from outside, but so do Ukraine and Azerbaijan. Israeli levels of religiosity are unremarkable, only 27% attend a service weekly and secular Jewish fertility is around replacement. Social services are generous but not unusually so.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ultimately, those who live in Israel or talk to Israelis almost always arrive at the same conclusion. Israeli culture just values having children intensely.</p>\n<p>\u2026 Another wonderful article, by Danielle Kubes in Canada\u2019s <em>National Post</em>, offers precisely the same explanation for high Israeli fertility: Israel is positively dripping with pronatal belief.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The conclusion is, a lot of things matter, but what matters most is that Israel has strong pronatal beliefs. As in, they rushed dead men from the October 7 attacks to the hospital, so they could do sperm extractions and allow them to have kids despite being dead.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Consequences</h4>\n\n\n<p>Fix your fertility rate, seek abundance beyond measure, or lose your civilization.</p>\n<p>Your call.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/SamoBurja/status/1901784722143121781\">Samo Burja</a>: As far as I can tell, the most notable political science results of the 21st century is democracy cannot work well with low fertility rates.</p>\n<p>All converge on prioritizing retirees over workers and immigrants over citizens escalating social transfers beyond sustainability.</p>\n<p>I think this means we should try to understand non-democratic regimes better since they will represent the majority of global political power in the future.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that the great graying and mass immigration simply are the end of democracies as we understood them.</p>\n<p>Just as failure to manage an economy and international trade were the end of Soviet Communism as we understood it.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Unfounded Optimism</h4>\n\n\n<p>Why do official baseline scenarios consistently project recovering fertility rates?</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/KelseyTuoc/status/1973130593807507483\">Kelsey Piper</a>: always a great sign when a projection is \u201cfor completely mysterious reasons this trend will reverse starting immediately and return to the baseline we believed in 25 years ago\u201d</p>\n<p>Jason Furman: Fertility rates are way below what the Social Security Trustees projected in both 2000 and 2010.

It may partly explain Britain\u2019s relative decline from the late 19th century.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For most of history the rich had more children that survived to adulthood than the poor.
