(<a href=\"https://substack.com/home/post/p-182350864\">xposted from new home</a>)</p>\n<p>I was at my very first job, Linden Lab, when EC2 and S3 came out in 2006. We were running Second Life out of three datacenters, where we racked and stacked all the servers ourselves. At the time, we were tangling with a slightly embarrassing data problem in that there was no real way for users to delete objects (the Trash folder was just another folder), and by the time we implemented a delete function, our ability to run garbage collection couldn\u2019t keep up with the rate of asset creation. In desperation, we spun up an experimental project to try using S3 as our asset store. Maybe we could make this Amazon\u2019s problem and buy ourselves some time?</p>\n<p>Why yes, we could. Other \u201cexperimental\u201d projects sprouted up like weeds: rebuilding server images in the cloud, running tests, storing backups, load testing, dev workstations. Everybody had shit they wanted to do that exceeded our supply of datacenter resources.</p>\n<p>By 2010, the center of gravity had shifted. Instead of \u201cmainstream engineering\u201d (datacenters) and \u201cexperimental\u201d (cloud), there was \u201cmainstream engineering\u201d (cloud) and \u201clegacy, shut it all down\u201d (datacenters).</p>\n<p>Why am I talking about the good old days? Because I have a gray beard and I like to stroke it, child.

An Open Letter to Vendors Selling AI for SREs</a>\u201d, which makes it sound like we\u2019re talking to vendors, but we\u2019re not; we\u2019re talking to our fellow SREs, begging them to engage with AI on the grounds that it\u2019s not ALL hype.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-wrap\" id=\"youtube2-twl_PdIpRA0\">\n<div class=\"youtube-inner\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>We\u2019re saying to a room of professional technological pessimists that AI\u00a0<em>needs</em>\u00a0them to engage. That their realism and attention to risk is more important than ever, but in order for their critique to be relevant and accurate and be\u00a0<em>heard</em>, it has to be grounded in expertise and knowledge. Nobody cares about the person outside taking potshots.</p>\n<p>This talk recently came up in conversation, and it made me realize\u2014with a bit of a shock\u2014how far my position has come since then.</p>\n<p>That was just eight months ago, and AI still felt like it was somehow separable, or a satellite of tech mainstream. People would gripe about conferences stacking the lineup with AI sessions, and AI getting shoehorned into every keynote.</p>\n<p>I get it. I too love to complain about technology, and this is certainly an industry that has seen its share of hype trains: dotcom, cloud, crypto, blockchain, IoT, web3, metaverse, and on and on. I understand why people are cynical\u2014why some are even actively looking for reasons to believe it\u2019s a mirage.</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset can-restack\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/substackcdn.com/image/fetch/%24s_%21b0yb%21%2Cw_1456%2Cc_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cq_auto%3Agood%2Cfl_progressive%3Asteep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94f8cfc9-7e48-4f16-af50-a3b97ff642e6_1536x1024.jpeg?w=416&#038;ssl=1\" />\n<div class=\"image-link-expand\">\n<div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>But for me, this year was for AI what 2010 was for the cloud: the year when AI stopped being satellite, experimental tech and started being the mainstream, foundational technology.

This would reduce American children&#8217;s access to rotavirus, meningitis, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, influenza, RSV, and chickenpox vaccines.

Technical governance is at the intersection of engineering and regulation, and includes things like designing chips with cryptographic off switches, or analyzing US and international law to see what levers different groups have to monitor AI training. The fellowship lasts 8 weeks (exact dates tbd but flexible), pays a $1200/week stipend, and will start with a one-week intro in Berkeley (flights/accommodations provided) followed by seven weeks potentially remote.

If you can pull off this level of resisting rising expectations you can then enjoy objectively high material living standards versus the past. That doesn\u2019t solve a lot of your other problems.

Society strongarms us to buy more house, more healthcare, more child supervision and far more advanced technology. The minimum available quality of various goods, in ways we both do and don\u2019t care about, has risen a lot.

Nah, not really bro, not easily.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>First, some brief questions worth asking in advance:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Can you actually execute on the one income plan?</li>\n<li>If not, what are you going to do about it?</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/zdch/status/1997058778668142780\">Zac Hill</a>: [That two incomes buy more than one] is the rub of this whole discourse. Wages being much higher means the cost of a person not working is also much higher. But is that a problem in need of a solution? If so, what is the solution, and why is \u201caccept a much lower income\u201d not also an acceptable solution?</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">It Takes Two (2)</h4>\n\n\n<p>Even if you could somehow execute on the above plan to survive on one income by having life suck in various ways, that plan also takes two.</p>\n<p>Not two incomes. Two parents.</p>\n<p>Hey baby, want to live on one income, Will Ricciardella style? Hey, come back here.</p>\n<p>Telling young men in particular \u2018you can do it on one income\u2019 via this kind of approach is a joke, because try telling the woman you want to marry that you want to live in the style Will Ricciardella describes above. See if she says yes.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">If So, Then What Are You Going To Do About It, Punk?</h4>\n\n\n<p>The question \u2018so what are you going to do about it?\u2019 is still a very good one.</p>\n<p>What do you do if families have the option of two incomes, and we set Expectations and Requirements based on two incomes, and you want to get by with only one? Adjusting how you spend money, and using the other parent\u2019s time to save some money, will only go so far.</p>\n<p>If you want one income households and stay at home parents to be viable here, I would say four things are required, in some combination. You don\u2019t need all four, but you definitely need #1, and then some additional help.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can deal with the Requirements. Let people purchase much less health care, child care and housing. Give people a huge amount of<a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/slack\"> Slack</a>, such that they can survive on one income despite the ability to earn two, and also pay for kids.</li>\n<li>You can deal with the Expectations. Raise the status and social acceptability of living cheap and making sacrifices.</li>\n<li>You can lessen the marginal returns to a second income, by increasing effective marginal tax rates. And That\u2019s Terrible, don\u2019t do this, but do note it would work.</li>\n<li>You can improve the economics of having children more generally. Children are an expensive public good. We can and should use the tax code to shift the burden.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I usually discuss these issues and questions, especially around #4, in terms of declining fertility. It is the same problem. If people don\u2019t feel able to have children in a way they find acceptable, then they will choose not to have children.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/jmhorp/status/1995521388178980978\">On the marginal tax rates, consider these graphs</a>.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vaqd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4869b7d0-4b51-4449-8c20-289a6bb0f31e_863x553.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cjjF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff9c800b6-da2e-43f9-b71c-41631d7cac87_1008x754.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YQhk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba97f57a-70e1-443e-b51b-aafcd6c376bc_1456x822.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>That\u2019s all obviously terrible policy, but it also means that you can obviously support a family on one $30k income if you could have done it on two $30k incomes, since your net benefits take home pay is not substantially lower after child care.</p>\n<p>Alternatively or additionally, from a policy perspective, you can accept that you\u2019re looking at two income households, and plan the world around making that work.</p>\n<p>The big problem with a two income household is child supervision.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The increased child supervision requirements, as in things like if anyone spots a 12 year old not in a parent\u2019s line of sight they think about calling the cops, are insanely expensive in every sense. This is the biggest pain point.</li>\n<li>The second biggest pain point is direct costs for daycare, which we could make substantially cheaper if we wanted to, and we could also subsidize it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/womens-professional-rise-is-good\">As Matthew Yglesias points out</a>, our school system and its endless days off implicitly assumes the mother can watch the children, while we also forbid letting children spend those days on their own, often even indoors. The obvious solution is to not give younger kids days off that aren\u2019t also national holidays, or to offer free other childcare on those days, where \u2018older\u2019 is defined as \u2018can leave them on their own for the day and no one tries to call CPS.\u2019</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ideally you do all of that anyway, it\u2019s badly needed, and you open up both choices.</p>\n<p>Now, back to the question of what is going on.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Revolution of Rising Expectations Redux</h4>\n\n\n<p>What should we make here of<a href=\"https://economistwritingeveryday.com/2025/05/14/spending-on-necessities-has-declined-dramatically-in-the-united-states/\"> the fact that spending on food, clothing and housing</a> (aka \u2018necessities\u2019) has collectively declined as a percentage of income, and also the food is way better and the houses are bigger?</p>\n<p>The definition of \u2018necessity\u2019 is not a constant, as the linked post admits. The \u2018necessities\u2019 that have gotten cheaper are the \u2018necessities of the past.\u2019 If things like education and health care and cell phones are de facto mandatory, and you have to buy them, then they are now necessities, even if in 1901 the services in question flat out didn\u2019t exist.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not to downplay how much the past sucked. It sucked a lot. Go see Hamnet or Train Dreams or The Housemaid.</p>\n<p>But there are other ways it didn\u2019t suck. In large part that was because you were allowed to suck without the rug being pulled out from under you for the crime of not having a rug, and also you didn\u2019t have to compare to all the families with fancy rugs.</p>\n<p>Life is vastly better. Life also really sucks compared to Rising Expectations.</p>\n<p>Setting aside AI, what do we do about it?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It\u2019s tough to lower the Rising Expectations. We should still do what we can here, primarily via cultural efforts, in the places we can do that.</li>\n<li>Rising Requirements are often unforced errors. We Can Fix It. We should attack. If we legalized housing, and legalized passing up Hansonian medicine, and got to a reasonable place on required child supervision, that would do it.</li>\n<li>Pay Parents Money. Children are a public good, and we are putting so much of the cost burden directly on the parents. People feel unable to raise families, and don\u2019t have children they want to have. We should do more transfers from the childless to those with children, and less of other types of transfers. Also eliminate all forms of the marriage penalty. Consider explicit subsidies for one income married families with kids under some threshold age. As in, acknowledge that stay at home parent is a job, and pay them for it.</li>\n<li>Provide more public goods for families. Remarkably small things can matter a lot.</li>\n<li>Reforming our system of transfers and benefits and taxes to eliminate the Poverty Trap, such that no one ever faces oppressive marginal tax rates or incentives to not work, and we stop forcing poor families to jump through so many hoops.</li>\n<li>All other ways of improving things also improve this. Give people better opportunities, better jobs, better life experiences, better anything, and especially better hope for the future in any and all ways.</li>\n</ol>"
