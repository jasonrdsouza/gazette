                "<p>For nearly a decade, the header of this website has been decorated with a mosaic-like pattern of coloured squares.\nI\u00a0can choose a colour for individual posts or pages, and that tints the title, the links, and the header.\nIt adds some texture and visual interest, without being too distracting.</p>\n\n<p>The implementation is pretty straightforward: I have one function that generates the coordinates of each square, and another that generates varying shades of the tint colour.\nPut those together, and it draws the header image.</p>\n\n<p>I recently improved the way I choose the shades of the tint colour, which makes the headers look more coherent, especially in dark mode.\nThe change is subtle, but a definite improvement.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-old-approach-varying-the-hsl-lightness\">The old approach: varying the HSL lightness</h2>\n\n<p>Before, this is how I generated the shades:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n<strong>Map to HSL.</strong>\nConvert the tint colour to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV\">hue-saturation-lightness (HSL) colour space</a>.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Define the bounds.</strong>\nI chose 7/8 and 8/7 of the original lightness, because it looked good in the first few colours I tried.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Jitter lightness.</strong>\nPick a random lightness value in this range.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Recombine and convert.</strong>\nPair this new lightness with the original hue and saturation, and convert back to sRGB.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I was trying to create colours which looked similar and varied only in lightness, so you\u2019d see lighter or darker shades of the tint colour.\nMy headers are PNG images, which are usually saved as sRGB, which is I why I convert back in the final step.</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what the old code looked like:</p>\n<pre><code>require <span class=\"s1\">'color'</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\"># Given a hex colour as a string (e.g. '#123456') generate</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># an infinite sequence of colours which vary only in brightness.</span>\ndef <span class=\"n\">get_colours_like</span><span

class=\"p\">.</span>to_rgb\n    end\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p>I <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed\">seeded</a> the random generator so it always returned the same colours \u2013 this meant my local dev environment and web server would always generate identical header images.\nNote that it\u2019s seeded based on the colour, so different tint colours will have light/dark squares in different places.</p>\n\n<p>All the colour calculations are done by Austin Ziegler\u2019s excellent <a href=\"https://github.com/halostatue/color\">color gem</a>, which saved me from implementing colour conversions myself.</p>\n\n<p>This approach is simple, but it has problems.\nVarying the lightness by proportion means the range varied from colour to colour \u2013 headers for dark colours didn\u2019t have enough contrast, while light colours had too much contrast.</p>\n\n<p>Here are three examples \u2013 notice how the dark header is almost solid colour, while the light header has enough contrast to become distracting:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"samples\">\n  <figure>\n    <img alt=\"Dark red coloured squares, which all blend into a dark red mush\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2026/470906.png\" />\n    <figcaption>#470906</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img alt=\"Brighter red coloured squares, with some visible variation but not much\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2026/d01c11.png\" />\n    <figcaption>#d01c11</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img alt=\"Very bright red coloured squares, some of which are almost white or light pink\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2026/f69b96.png\" />\n    <figcaption>#f69b96</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n\n<p>This heuristic worked for the first colour I tried (<code>#d01c11</code>, the site\u2019s original tint colour) but it breaks down as I\u2019ve added more colours, especially in dark mode.</p>\n\n<p>I could replace the percentages with fixed offsets \u2013 for example, plus or minus 25% lightness \u2013 but this wouldn\u2019t fix the problem.\nHumans aren\u2019t machines; we don\u2019t perceive colours as linear numerical values.\nThe human eye is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_vision#Physiology_of_color_perception\">more sensitive to some colours than others</a>, so the same numerical jump in HSL doesn\u2019t feel like the same visual difference.</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s look at another example, where I\u2019ll fix the hue and saturation, and step the lightness by 25%.\nThese differences don\u2019t feel the same:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"samples\">\n  <figure>\n    <img alt=\"A deep blue square which is highly saturated\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2026/blue-50.png\" />\n    <figcaption>hsl(240, 100%, 50%)</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img alt=\"A lavender-coloured square\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2026/blue-75.png\" />\n    <figcaption>hsl(240, 100%, 75%)</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img alt=\"A square of pure white\" id=\"white_square\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2026/blue-100.png\" />\n    <figcaption>hsl(240, 100%, 100%)</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n\n<p>There are alternative colour spaces like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklch\">OKLCH</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB\">CIELAB</a> which try to capture the nuances of human biology and how we interpret colours, and that\u2019s where I looked at for a replacement.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-cielab-colour-space\">The CIELAB colour space</h2>\n\n<p>The CIELAB colour space is based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opponent_process\">opponent process theory</a>, which suggests that we perceive colour as a battle of three opposing pairs: black vs. white, red vs. green, and blue vs. yellow.\nThink about how you never see a reddish-green or a blueish-yellow \u2013 these colours are opposites.</p>\n\n<p>These three pairs give us the three coordinates in CIELAB space:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<em>L*</em> is the perceptual lightness (black vs. white)</li>\n  <li>\n<em>a*</em> is the red-green axis</li>\n  <li>\n<em>b*</em> is the blue-yellow axis</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(The other three letters stand for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_on_Illumination\">Commission internationale de l\u2019\u00e9clairage</a>, the standards body who developed CIELAB in 1976.)</p>\n\n<p>Within this colour space, we can calculate the <em>perceptual difference</em> between two colours.\nIdeally, that numerical distance should match our human perception of the change.\nThe goal is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference#Tolerance\"><em>perceptually uniformity</em></a>: if you move a fixed numerical distance anywhere in the space, the \u201camount\u201d of change should feel the same to a human observer.</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s much easier said than done: the measurement formulas (like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference#CIELAB_%CE%94E*\">Delta\u00a0E</a>) have been refined over decades, and deficiences have been found in CIELAB, especially for shades of blue.\nNewer spaces like OKLAB try to capture the nuances of human biology even more accurately.\nBut for the purpose of my header images, CIELAB is good enough, and a big improvement over HSL.</p>\n\n<p>One place I already use CIELAB is in my tool for <a href=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2021/dominant-colours/\">extracting dominant colours</a>.\nI\u2019m using <em>k</em>\u2011means clustering to group colours that are \u201cclose\u201d together, and it makes sense to measure closeness using perceptual distance.</p>\n\n<p>The Ruby gem I\u2019m using supports CIELAB but not OKLAB, which also informed my decision.\nColour maths is complicated, and I\u2019d rather use an existing implementation than write it all myself.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"my-new-approach-varying-the-cielab-perceptual-lightness\">My new approach: varying the CIELAB perceptual lightness</h2>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s my new heuristic:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n<strong>Map to CIELAB.</strong>\nConvert the tint colour to CIELAB space.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Define the bounds.</strong>\nChoose a fixed distance, and find how much you need to increase/decrease the perceptual brightness <em>L*</em> to reach that distance.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Jitter lightness.</strong>\nPick a random <em>L*</em> value in this range.</li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Recombine and convert.</strong>\nPair this new lightness with the original <em>a*</em> and <em>b*</em> components, and convert back to sRGB.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To find the bounds, I do a binary search on the possible lightness values to find the perceptual lightness which gets me closest to the target distance.\nIf I\u2019m looking for the lighter shade, I search the range <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mo>(</mo>&lt;/mo&gt;<mi>L</mi><mi>*</mi><mo>,</mo><mn>100</mn><mo>)</mo>&lt;/ml&gt;</math>.\nIf I\u2019m looking for the darker shade, I search the range <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mo>(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mi>L</mi><mi>*</mi><mo>)</mo>&lt;/ml&gt;.</math></p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the code:</p>\n<pre><code>require <span

And more and more people are talking about it. But what is ruliology? Since I invented the term, I decided I should write something to explain it. But then I realized: I actually already wrote something back in 2021 when I first invented the term. What I wrote back then was part of something longer. But here now is the part that explains ruliology:</em></p>\n<p><img alt=\"A banner displaying the word \u201cruliology\u201d, labeled as a noun, followed by the definition \u201cthe pure basic science of what simple rules do\u201d.\" height=\"155\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/sites/43/2026/01/sw01122026hero.png\" title=\"A banner displaying the word \u201cruliology\u201d, labeled as a noun, followed by the definition \u201cthe pure basic science of what simple rules do\u201d.\" width=\"624\" /></p>\n<p>If one sets up a system to follow a particular set of simple rules, what will the system do? Or, put another way, how do all those simple programs out there in the computational universe of possible programs behave?</p>\n<p>These are pure, abstract questions of basic science. They\u2019re questions one\u2019s led to ask when one\u2019s operating in the computational paradigm that I describe in <em><a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/toc.html\">A New Kind of Science</a></em>. But at some level they\u2019re questions about the specific science of what abstract rules (that we can describe as programs) do.<span id=\"more-71870\"></span></p>\n<p>What is that science? It\u2019s not computer science, because that would be about programs we construct for particular purposes, rather than ones that are just \u201cout there in the wilds of the computational universe\u201d. It\u2019s not (as such) mathematics, because it\u2019s all about \u201cseeing what rules do\u201d rather than finding frameworks in which things can be proved. And in the end, it\u2019s clear it\u2019s actually a new science\u2014that\u2019s rich and broad, and that I, at least, have had the pleasure of practicing for forty years.</p>\n<p>But what should this science be called? I&#8217;ve wondered about this for decades. I&#8217;ve filled so many pages with possible names. Could it be based on Greek or Latin words associated with rules? Those are <em>arch-</em> and <em>reg-</em>: very well-trafficked roots. What about words associated with computation? That&#8217;d be <em>logis-</em> or <em>calc-</em>. None of these seem to work. But\u2014in something akin to the process of <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#metamodeling-and-the-metatheory-of-models\">metamodeling</a>\u2014we can ask: What is the essence of what we want to communicate in the word?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all about studying rules, and what their consequences are. So why not the simple and obvious \u201cruliology\u201d? Yes, it\u2019s a new and slightly unusual-sounding word. But I think it does well at communicating what this science that I\u2019ve enjoyed for so long is about. And I, for one, will be pleased to call myself a \u201cruliologist\u201d. </p>\n<p>But what is ruliology really about? It\u2019s a pure, basic science\u2014and a very clean and precise one. It\u2019s about setting up abstract rules, and then seeing what they do. There\u2019s no \u201cwiggle room\u201d. No issue with \u201creproducibility\u201d. You run a rule, and it does what it does. The same every time.</p>\n<p>What does the <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p59--more-cellular-automata/\">rule 73 cellular automaton starting from a single black cell do</a>? What does some <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p78--turing-machines/\">particular Turing machine do</a>? What about some particular <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p204--multiway-systems/\">multiway string substitution system</a>? These are specific questions of ruliology. </p>\n<p>At first you might just do the computation, and visualize the result. But maybe you notice some particular feature. And then you can use whatever methods it takes to get a specific ruliological result\u2014and to establish, for example, that in the rule 73 pattern, <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-3-2--rule-73/\">black cells appear only in odd-length blocks</a>.</p>\n<p>Ruliology tends to start with specific cases of specific rules. But then it generalizes, looking at broader ranges of cases for a particular rule, or whole classes of rules. And it always has concrete things to do\u2014visualizing behavior, measuring specific features, and so on.</p>\n<p>But ruliology quickly comes face to face with computational irreducibility. What does some particular case of some particular rule eventually do? That may require an irreducible amount of computational effort to find out\u2014and if one insists on knowing what amounts to a general truly infinite-time result, it may be formally undecidable. It\u2019s the same story with looking at different cases of a rule, or different rules. Is there any case that does this? Or any rule that does it?</p>\n<p>What\u2019s remarkable to me\u2014even after 40 years of ruliology\u2014is how many surprises there end up being. You have some particular kind of rule. And it looks as if it\u2019s only going to behave in some particular way. But no, eventually you find a case where it does something completely different, and unexpected. And, yes, this is in effect computational irreducibility reaching into what one\u2019s seeing.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I\u2019ve thought of ruliology as being at first a bit like natural history. You\u2019re exploring the world of simple programs, finding what strange creatures exist in it\u2014and capturing them for study. (And, yes, in actual biological natural history, the diversity of what one sees is presumably at its core exactly the <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2024/05/why-does-biological-evolution-work-a-minimal-model-for-biological-evolution-and-other-adaptive-processes/\">same computational phenomenon</a> we see in abstract ruliology.)</p>\n<p>So how does ruliology <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/\">relate to complexity</a>? It\u2019s a core part\u2014and in fact the most fundamental part\u2014of studying the <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#returning-to-the-foundations-of-complexity\">foundations of complexity</a>. Ruliology is like studying complexity at its ultimate source. And about seeing just how complexity is generated from its simplest origins.</p>\n<p>Ruliology is what builds raw material\u2014and intuition\u2014for making models. It\u2019s what shows us what\u2019s possible in the computational universe, and what we can use to model\u2014and understand\u2014the systems we study.</p>\n<p>In metamodeling we\u2019re going from models that have been constructed, and drilling down to see what\u2019s underneath them. In ruliology we\u2019re in a sense going the other way, building up from the minimal foundations to see what can happen.</p>\n<p>In some ways, ruliology is like natural science. It\u2019s taking the computational universe as an abstracted analog of nature, and studying how things work in it. But in other ways, ruliology is something more generative than natural science: because within the science itself, it\u2019s thinking not only about what is, but also about what can abstractly be generated.</p>\n<p>Ruliology in some ways starts as an experimental science, and in some ways is abstract and theoretical from the beginning. It\u2019s experimental because it\u2019s often concerned with just running simple programs and seeing what they do (and in general, computational irreducibility suggests you often can\u2019t do better). But it\u2019s abstract and theoretical in the sense that what\u2019s being run is not some actual thing in the natural world, with all its details and approximations, but something completely precise, defined and computational.</p>\n<p>Like natural science, ruliology starts from observations\u2014but then builds up to theories and principles. Long ago I found a <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p231--four-classes-of-behavior/\">simple classification of cellular automata</a> (starting from random initial conditions)\u2014somehow reminiscent of identifying solids, liquids and gases, or different kingdoms of organisms. But beyond such classifications, there are also much broader principles\u2014with the most important, I believe, being the <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/\">Principle of Computational Equivalence</a>. </p>\n<p>The everyday course of doing ruliology doesn\u2019t require engaging directly with the whole Principle of Computational Equivalence. But throughout ruliology, the principle is crucial in guiding intuition, and having an idea of what to expect. And, by the way, it\u2019s from ruliology that we can get evidence (like the <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p675--the-rule-110-cellular-automaton/\">universality of rule 110</a>, and of the <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/\">2,3 Turing machine</a>) for the broad validity of the principle.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been doing ruliology (though not by that name) for forty years. And I\u2019ve done a lot of it. In fact, it\u2019s probably been my top methodology in everything I\u2019ve done in science. It\u2019s what led me to understand the origins of complexity, first in cellular automata. It\u2019s what led me to formulate the general ideas in <em>A New Kind of Science</em>. And it\u2019s what gave me the intuition and impetus to <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/\">launch our new Physics Project</a>.</p>\n<p>I find ruliology deeply elegant, and satisfying. There\u2019s something very aesthetic\u2014at least to me\u2014about the purity of just seeing what simple rules do. (And it doesn\u2019t hurt that they often make very pleasing images.) It\u2019s also satisfying when one can go from so little and get so much\u2014and do so automatically, just by running something on a computer. </p>\n<p>And as well I like the fundamental permanence of ruliology. If one\u2019s dealing with the simplest rules of some type, they\u2019re going to be foundational not only now, but forever. It\u2019s like simple mathematical constructs\u2014like the icosahedron. There were icosahedral dice in ancient Egypt. But when we find them today, their shapes still seem completely modern\u2014because the icosahedron is something fundamental and timeless. Just like the rule 30 pattern or countless other discoveries in ruliology.</p>\n<p>In a sense perhaps one of the biggest surprises is that ruliology is such a comparatively new activity. But as I <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-2-3--close-approaches-to-core-discoveries/\">cataloged in <em>A New Kind of Science</em></a>, it has precursors going back hundreds and perhaps thousands of years. But without the whole paradigm of <em>A New Kind of Science, </em>there wasn\u2019t a context to understand why ruliology is so significant. </p>\n<p>So what constitutes a good piece of ruliology? I think it\u2019s all about simplicity and minimality. The best ruliology happens after metamodeling is finished\u2014and one\u2019s really dealing with the simplest, most minimal class of rules of some particular type. In my efforts to do ruliology, for example in <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, I like to be able to \u201cexplain\u201d the rules I\u2019m using just by an explicit diagram, if possible with no words needed. </p>\n<p>Then it\u2019s important to show what the rules do\u2014as explicitly as possible. Sometimes\u2014as in cellular automata\u2014there\u2019s a very obvious visual representation that can be used. But in other cases it\u2019s important to do the work to find some scheme for visualization that\u2019s as explicit as possible, and that both shows the whole of what\u2019s going on and doesn\u2019t introduce distracting or arbitrary additional elements.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s amazing how often in doing ruliology I\u2019ll end up making an array of thumbnail images of how certain rules behave. And, again, the explicitness of this is important. Yes, one often wants to do various kinds of filtering, say of rules. But in the end I\u2019ve found that one needs to just look at what happens. Because that\u2019s the only way to successfully notice the unexpected, and to get a sense of the irreducible complexity of what\u2019s out there in the computational universe of possible rules.</p>\n<p>When I see papers that report what amounts to ruliology, I always like it when there are explicit pictures. I\u2019m disappointed if all I see are formal definitions, or plots with curves on them. It\u2019s an inevitable consequence of computational irreducibility that in doing good ruliology, one has to look at things more explicitly.</p>\n<p>One of the great things about ruliology as a field of study is how easy it is to explore new territory. The computational universe contains an infinite number of possible rules. And even among ones that one might consider \u201csimple\u201d, there are inevitably astronomically many on any human scale. But, OK, if one explores some particular ruliological system, what of it?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a bit like chemistry where one explores properties of some particular molecule. Exploring some particular class of rules, you may be lucky enough to come upon some new phenomenon, or understand some new general principle. But what you know you\u2019ll be doing is systematically adding to the body of knowledge in ruliology.</p>\n<p>Why is that important? For a start, ruliology is what provides the raw material for making models, so you\u2019re in effect creating a template for some potential future model. And in addition, when it comes to technology, an important approach that I\u2019ve discussed (and used) quite extensively involves \u201cmining\u201d the computational universe for \u201ctechnologically useful\u201d programs. And good ruliology is crucial in helping to make that feasible.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a bit like creating technology in the physical universe. It was crucial, for example, that good physics and chemistry had been done on liquid crystals. Because that\u2019s what allowed them to be identified\u2014and used\u2014in making displays.</p>\n<p>Beyond its \u201cpragmatic\u201d value for models and for technology, another thing ruliology does is to provide \u201cempirical raw material\u201d for making broader theories about the computational universe. When I discovered the Principle of Computational Equivalence, it was as a result of several years of detailed ruliology on particular types of rules. And good ruliology is what prepares and catalogs examples from which theoretical advances can be made.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth mentioning that there\u2019s a certain tendency to want to \u201cnail down ruliology\u201d using, for example, mathematics. And sometimes it\u2019s possible to derive a nice summary of ruliological results using, say, some piece of discrete mathematics. But it\u2019s remarkable how quickly the mathematics tends to get out of hand, with even a very simple rule having behavior that can only be <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-12-8--turing-machine-600720/\">captured by large amounts of obscure mathematics</a>. But of course that\u2019s in a sense just computational irreducibility rearing its head. And showing that mathematics is not the methodology to use\u2014and that instead something new is needed. Which is precisely where ruliology comes in.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve spent many years defining the character and subject matter of what I\u2019m now calling ruliology. But there\u2019s something else I\u2019ve done too, which is to build a large tower of practical technology for actually doing ruliology. It\u2019s taken more than forty years to build up to what\u2019s now the <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/\">full-scale computational language</a> that is the <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/language/\">Wolfram Language</a>. But all that time, I was using what we were building to do ruliology. </p>\n<p>The Wolfram Language is great and important for many things. But when it comes to ruliology, it\u2019s simply a perfect fit. Of course it\u2019s got lots of relevant built-in features. Like visualization, graph manipulation, etc., as well as immediate support for systems like <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CellularAutomaton.html\">cellular automata</a>, <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SubstitutionSystem.html\">substitution systems</a> and <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TuringMachine.html\">Turing machines</a>. But what\u2019s even more important is that its fundamental symbolic structure gives it an explicit way to represent\u2014and run\u2014essentially any computational rule. </p>\n<p>In doing practical ruliological explorations\u2014and for example searching the computational universe\u2014it\u2019s also useful to have immediate support for things like <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/ParallelComputing.html\">parallel computation</a>. But another crucial aspect of the Wolfram Language for doing practical ruliology is the concept of <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/notebooks/\">notebooks and computable documents</a>. Notebooks let one organize both the process of research and the presentation of its results. </p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been <a href=\"https://www.wolframphysics.org/archives/index/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">accumulating research notebooks</a> about ruliology for more than 30 years now\u2014with textual notes, images of behavior, and code. And it\u2019s a great thing. Because the stability of the Wolfram Language (and its notebook format) means that I can immediately go back to something I did 30 years ago, run the code, and build on it. And when it comes to presenting results, I can do it as a <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/11/what-is-a-computational-essay/\">computational essay</a>, created in a notebook\u2014in which the task of exposition is shared between text, pictures and computational language code.</p>\n<p>In a traditional technical paper based on the mathematical paradigm, the formal part of the presentation will normally use mathematical notation. But for ruliology (as for \u201ccomputational X\u201d fields) what one needs instead is computational notation, or rather computational language\u2014which is exactly what the Wolfram Language provides. And in a good piece of ruliology\u2014and ruliology presentation\u2014the notation should be simple, clear and elegant. And because it\u2019s in computational language, it\u2019s not just something people read; it\u2019s also something that can immediately be executed or integrated somewhere else.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"An AI-generated image of a plaque on a university building that reads \u201cDepartment of Ruliology\u201d.\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/sites/43/2026/01/sw01122026department-a.png\" style=\"width: 130px; height: auto; margin-left: 10px; float: right;\" title=\"An AI-generated image of a plaque on a university building that reads \u201cDepartment of Ruliology\u201d.\" />What should the future of ruliology be?

Well, life it\u2019s fair, I report the facts rather than make the rules, and the whole thing sounds like a you problem.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Kryssy La Reida: Serious question for men\u2026what is it that makes you feel like you are in a relationship with a woman that you can\u2019t express your feelings to? Or why would you even want to be in one where you don\u2019t have a safe space to do so? If your partner isn\u2019t that safe landing space for those emotions what is the point? Or are you just conditioned to not express them?</p>\n<p>Eric Electrons: Many women will often say they want vulnerability in a man, no matter how calmly and respectfully delivered, but treat us differently once they get it, use it against us when upset, joke about it, or share it without our consent to friends and family.</p>\n<p>It takes time and experience to truly identify a woman who is trustworthy and knowledgeable enough to handle expressing your feelings to as a man. Especially, if she\u2019s a significant other.</p>\n<p>Philosophi_Cat: It\u2019s true that many women say they want a man who\u2019s \u201cin touch with his emotions,\u201d yet get the \u201cick\u201d when he expresses them. This can be bewildering for men, but the issue lies in <em>how</em> emotion is expressed, not in the fact of feeling it.</p>\n<p>Yes, women tend value a man who has emotional fluency and depth, someone who can articulate his inner world and empathise with hers.</p>\n<p>But they recoil when a man loses his composure, collapses emotionally and turns to her for emotional containment. The moment she has to soothe or stabilise him, when she must step into the role of his therapist or mother, the polarity between them collapses. She no longer feels his strength; she feels his need. And that is where the \u201cick\u201d arises from.</p>\n<p>So this is the key distinction: Emotional depth does not mean emotional dumping.</p>\n<p>A man can speak openly about his struggles while remaining self-possessed and anchored in his own centre. He might say, \u201cI\u2019ve had a rough week and I\u2019m working through some frustration, but I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d rather than dissolving into self-pity or seeking reassurance. He shares what\u2019s real without burdening her with it. His emotions are contained by his own form.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s what women respond to: emotional transparency grounded in composure. It signals a robust and stable inner centre. It shows he can hold complexity without being consumed by it.</p>\n<p>By contrast, many men, fearing that any show of feeling will make them appear weak, over-correct by suppressing or hiding their emotions entirely.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/robinhanson/status/1988586523990868050\">Robin Hanson</a>: So men, feel emotions only if you fully command them. If you are instead vulnerable to them, you are \u201cick\u201d. Got that?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Robin\u2019s imprecise here. It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t feel the emotions, it\u2019s that you can\u2019t talk about or too obviously reveal them, and especially can\u2019t burden her with them. Unless, that is, you are sufficiently justified in not commanding them in a given situation, in which case you can do it.</p>\n<p>As with many other similar things this creates a skill issue. Yes, we\u2019d all (regardless of gender) like to be fully in touch with and in command of our emotions and in a place where we can own and share all of it securely and all that, while also having a good sense of when it\u2019s wise to not share. That\u2019s asking a lot, so most people need practical advice on how to handle it all.</p>\n<p>When you sense potential trouble and the wrong move can cause permanent damage up to and including the ick, risk aversion and holding things back is the natural play. But if you always do that you definitely fail, and you also don\u2019t fail fast. A lot of risk aversion is aversion to failing fast when you should welcome failing fast, which is the opposite of the correct strategy.</p>\n<p>So you\u2019ll need to start getting command and ownership of at least some of those emotions, and you should err on the side of sharing more faster if you\u2019re in position to handle it, but also it\u2019s fine to hold other stuff back or be vague about it, especially negative stuff.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You Are Still Single Because You Don\u2019t Know When To Show Emotions</h4>\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll be told that the above is overthinking things. It isn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>It is extremely attractive to feel and openly show your emotions and get away with it, if you do it successfully, largely because it is so difficult to do it successfully.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/primalpoly/status/1955997698202722372\">Taylor</a>: wish men understood how attractive it is when they can feel &amp; openly show their emotions instead of acting like a sociopathic brick wall.</p>\n<p>Pay Roll Manager Here: Any man reading her tweet, please do not believe her.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/robinhanson/status/1956008288207728798\">Geoffrey Miller:</a> Sexual selection through mate choice can shape traits faster than any other evolutionary process can. If women were really attracted to men who cried a lot, men would have evolved, very quickly, to cry a lot.</p>\n<p>Robin Hanson: And if women who actually knew what they wanted and said so honestly were attractive to men, that would have evolved very quickly too, right?</p></blockquote>\n<p>On the evolutionary level, yes selection is rapid but even if the effect were extreme that\u2019s over centuries and millennia, not decades. So the \u2018if this was attractive evolution would have handled it\u2019 argument only holds for traits that would have been attractive in older worlds very different from our own, in cultures radically different from our own, where selection operated very differently.</p>\n<p>Also, a lot of your reproductive success in those worlds (and ours) is about intersexual dynamics and resource acquisition, and several other factors, so a trait can be attractive but still get aggressively selected against.</p>\n<p>So while yes, obviously evolution can offer some very big hints and should be considered, you cannot assume that this is predictive of what works now.</p>\n<p>\u2018Can feel and openly show emotions\u2019 is not one thing. There are some ways that being able to feel and openly show emotions is attractive and winning. In other ways and situations it is very much not. Like when you train an LLM, there are a bunch of correlated things that will tend to move in correlated ways, and modifying one thing also modifies other things.</p>\n<p>So yes, when you see the player in the clip talk about missing his family, that is (mostly) a good use of feeling and showing emotions at this point (although it wouldn\u2019t have gone as great in the same spot even a few decades ago, I am guessing). But that doesn\u2019t mean that showing that level of emotion and crying on a regular basis will go that well.</p>\n<p>This is a skill issue. Being the brick wall is not a universally optimal play. But it is a safer play in any given situation. In many situations it is indeed correct, and at low levels of related skill it is better than the alternatives even more often.</p>\n<p>First best is to be in touch with your emotions but be high skilled in managing them and knowing when and how to communicate them to others, and so on. Second best is to be cautious. Long term, yes, you want to pick up this skill.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019re Single Because You Don\u2019t Have Enough Gendered Energy</h4>\n\n\n<p>This is speculative.

I think it\u2019s some combination of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I\u2019m less attracted to men who blindly follow social scripts.</li>\n<li>I have no interest in unequal partnership (except for kinky reasons) and I want my date to appreciate that.</li>\n<li>I dislike the kind of feminism that demands a bunch of advantages for women without accepting the corresponding responsibilities, and it disappoints me when women don\u2019t reject this.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is not to say that I\u2019m against men ever paying, I just wish we\u2019d reject it as this weird value-laden social norm. My preferred scenario would be to randomize it each time, perhaps weighted more towards the person who is wealthier</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/Aella_Girl/status/1964715675831976375\">Aella:</a> Yeah when I let a guy pay on a date I feel myself putting one foot into escort world where I become suddenly aware that our relationship is transactional.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The transactionalism worry is real as a downside. Despite this, I believe men should very clearly pay on most first dates, for at least five good (related) reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The man is usually the one doing the asking.</li>\n<li>The man is usually the one doing the planning.</li>\n<li>The man does not want her to have the distraction or bad vibes of thinking about money or having not paid. This is a lot of vibe improvement at low cost.</li>\n<li>The man wants the woman to say yes more often both to the first and subsequent dates, and have positive memories and a positive experience.</li>\n<li>The man wants to send a costly signal of several things.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thus, given other dynamics present, the man should usually pay for the first date. This is a relatively acceptable way to make the date market clear more often and improve outcomes.</p>\n<p>To the extent that the above justifications are broken, such as when the woman is initiating and suggesting the activity, that is an exception.</p>\n<p>Consider an obvious example where one party should pay: If you are invited over to someone\u2019s house for dinner, very obviously they should usually not send you a bill, no matter what relationship you have with them or what else you might do or not do. Similarly, I am a big fan of the rule I have with some of my friends that whoever travels the farthest does not pay for dinner.</p>\n<p>Very obviously, if you have someone like Ruby or Aella where the vibes run the other way, and not paying hurts their experience? Then you should split or they should pay, It is on her to let him know this. He should reach for and request the check in a way that indicates intention to pay, but in a soft way that is interruptible.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019re Single But Not Because You Make Too Much Money</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/JeremiahDJohns/status/1937895580547559881\">Jeremiah Johnson</a>: So Cartoons Hate Her <a href=\"https://www.cartoonshateher.com/p/do-women-have-to-lie-about-their\">tested the \u2018Men are turned off when women have high paying jobs\u2019 hypothesis</a>.

See Taylor Tomlinson\u2019s bit about how she wants to marry a stay-at-home dad, but not a man who wants to be one, so she needs to find a successful man and destroy him, and she\u2019s kind of into him resenting her for it.</p>\n<p>Which is all entirely compatible with CHH\u2019s findings, but also means that you\u2019re strictly better off making more money rather than less.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019re Single Because You Gave Someone A Ride</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/shut_thefu_/status/1950846604447301746\">Shut Thefu:</a> Don\u2019t have my car today so requested a colleague if he can drop me on the way.</p>\n<p>His exact reply, \u201csorry dear, my wife may not appreciate it.\u201d Men, it is really that simple.</p>\n<p>Aella: Are the monogs ok</p>\n<p>J: But yet you wanted to put him in that position. <img alt=\"\ud83e\udd14\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f914.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>Unfair: If dropping a colleague on your way is such an issue with your partner, you\u2019re in a toxic relationship that will end badly one way or the other</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/loserbent/status/1951005496686813352\">Sammy:</a> is it not entirely offensive to people that their partner\u2019s are out there implying their relationship can\u2019t survive a simple favor lmao?</p>\n<p>\u201csorry my marriage is weaker than a car ride home with a woman. for some reason this is neither embarrassing nor sexist\u201d</p>\n<p>Books By J: I was confused too when I saw the post earlier lol</p>\n<p>Could never be me.

Then he apparently followed me and found the coffee shop I frequented. All this time I thought we had a sweet first time meeting story. He accidentally bumped into me, apologized, and offered to buy me coffee for the trouble.</p>\n<p>He told me what he was ordering and it was the exact same thing I always get and I thought it was an amazing coincidence, I joked that it was fate and we spent like an hour talking over coffee. I feel so stupid. Apparently it was similar to a scene in a book that I had read and told my coworker I had thought was cute.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m just so frustrated, like why would you do this? And how much of our year and a half relationship is a lie.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The original response thread I saw this from said <a href=\"https://x.com/thechosenberg/status/1930398517081817200\">this was romantic</a> and asked \u2018you thought a meet cute was organic in 2025?\u2019 Yes, meet cutes can still be organic, or involve a lot less stalking and deception.</p>\n<p>The main problem with mostly harmless versions of such things is that they strongly correlate with and predict future very much not harmless versions of those and other things.

For example, one sometimes needs to Perform Vacation (or another occasion or action) and present as if one is happy in context, and they want you to do this if needed but it wouldn\u2019t work if they outright knew you were faking it.</p>\n<p>There certainly is also a class of \u2018do your research\u2019 strategies where you would okay with someone doing this as long as they kept it to themselves how they found out.</p>\n<p>As many noted, the (often far more intensive) gender flipped version of this is common, and guys are remarkably often entirely fine with it (including many cases where it goes way too far and they shouldn\u2019t be, but also many cases in which it is totally fine). This is not \u2018fair\u2019 but the logic follows.</p>"
