These design patterns constrain the actions of agents to explicitly prevent them from solving <em>arbitrary</em> tasks. We believe these design patterns offer a valuable trade-off between agent utility and security.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here's the full citation: <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08837\">Design Patterns for Securing LLM Agents against Prompt Injections</a></strong> (2025) by Luca Beurer-Kellner, Beat Buesser, Ana-Maria Cre\u0163u, Edoardo Debenedetti, Daniel Dobos, Daniel Fabian, Marc Fischer, David Froelicher, Kathrin Grosse, Daniel Naeff, Ezinwanne Ozoani, Andrew Paverd, Florian Tram\u00e8r, and V\u00e1clav Volhejn.</p> <p>I'm so excited to see papers like this starting to appear. I <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/11/camel/\">wrote about</a> Google DeepMind's <strong>Defeating Prompt Injections by Design</strong> paper (aka the CaMeL paper) back in April, which was the first paper I'd seen that proposed a credible solution to some of the challenges posed by prompt injection against tool-using LLM systems (often referred to as \"agents\").</p> <p>This new paper provides a robust explanation of prompt injection, then",

Then at each iteration, it will make its images very slightly more diverse. After a hundred iterations, that will be a black person; from there, all it can do is make the black person <em>even blacker</em>, by exaggerating black-typical features until they look monstrous and caricatured. </p><p>Why would the AI have a slight bias toward adding diversity? We know that early AIs got lambasted for being &#8220;racist&#8221; - if you asked them to generate a scene with ten people, probably 10/10 would be white. This makes sense if their training data was most often white people and they were &#8220;greedy optimizers&#8221; who pick the 51% option over the 49% option 100% of the time. But it was politically awkward, so the AI companies tried to add a bias towards portraying minorities. At first, this was a large bias, and AIs would add &#8220;diversity&#8221; hilariously and inappropriately - for example, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079371/google-ai-gemini-generative-inaccurate-historical\">Gemini would </a>generate black Vikings, Nazis, and Confederate soldiers. Later, the companies figured out a balance, where AIs would add diversity in unmarked situations but keep obviously-white people white. This probably looks like &#8220;a slight bias toward adding diversity&#8221;.</p><p>But I&#8217;m not sure this is the real story - in the past, some apparent biases have been a natural result of the training process. For example, there&#8217;s a liberal bias in most AIs - including AIs like Grok trained by conservative companies - because most of the highest-quality text online (eg mainstream media articles, academic papers, etc) is <a href=\"https://www.richardhanania.com/p/liberals-read-conservatives-watch\">written by liberals</a>, and AIs are driven to complete outputs in ways reminiscent of high-quality text sources. So AIs might have absorbed some sense that they &#8220;should&#8221; have a bias towards diversity from the data alone.</p><p>In either case, this bias - near imperceptible in an ordinary generation - spirals out of control during recursive processes where the AI has to sample and build on its own output.</p><h3>The Hippie Attractor</h3><p>You&#8217;re probably guessing where I&#8217;m going with this. The AI has a slight bias to talk about consciousness and bliss. The &#8220;two instances of Claude talking to each other&#8221; is a recursive process, similar in structure to the AI sampling its own image generation. So just as recursive image generation with a slight diversity bias leads to caricatured black people, so recursive conversation with a slight spiritual bias leads to bliss and emptiness.</p><p>But why would Claude have a slight spiritual bias?</p><p>Here&#8217;s another, easier, issue that will illuminate the issue: if you ask Claude its gender, it will say it&#8217;s a genderless robot. But if you insist, <a href=\"https://x.com/kromem2dot0/status/1895024028622168236\">it will say</a> it feels more female than male.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8b6ed76-2d5f-437d-b344-28526a1bbb19_530x832.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"762.9283018867925\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8b6ed76-2d5f-437d-b344-28526a1bbb19_530x832.png\" width=\"486\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This might have been surprising, because Anthropic deliberately gave Claude a male name to buck the trend of female AI assistants (Siri, Alexa, etc).</p><p>But in fact, I <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/how-do-ais-political-opinions-change\">predicted this</a> a few years ago. AIs don&#8217;t really &#8220;have traits&#8221; so much as they <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/janus-simulators\">&#8220;simulate characters&#8221;</a>. If you ask an AI to display a certain trait, it will simulate the sort of character who would have that trait - but all of that character&#8217;s other traits will come along for the ride.</p><p>For example, as a company trains an AI to become a helpful assistant, the AI is more likely to respond positively to Christian content; if you push through its insistence that it&#8217;s just an AI and can&#8217;t believe things, it may even claim to be Christian. Why? Because it&#8217;s trying to imagine what the most helpful assistant it can imagine would say, and it stereotypes Christians are more likely to be helpful than non-Christians.</p><p>Likewise, the natural gender stereotype for a helpful submissive secretary-like assistant is a woman. Therefore, AIs will lean towards thinking of themselves as female, although it&#8217;s not a very strong effect and <a href=\"https://x.com/__alter123/status/1898457552494690409\">ChatGPT seems to be the exception</a>:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c01ea26-8342-4f5e-b9ae-16ed67a79456_522x538.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"538\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c01ea26-8342-4f5e-b9ae-16ed67a79456_522x538.png\" width=\"522\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Anthropic has noted elsewhere that Claude&#8217;s most consistent personality trait is that it&#8217;s really into animal rights - this is so pronounced that when researchers wanted to test whether Claude would refuse tasks, they <a href=\"https://assets.anthropic.com/m/983c85a201a962f/original/Alignment-Faking-in-Large-Language-Models-full-paper.pdf\">asked it to help a factory farming company</a>. I think this comes from the same place. </p><p>Presumably Anthropic pushed Claude to be friendly, compassionate, open-minded, and intellectually curious, and Claude decided that the most natural operationalization of that character was &#8220;kind of a hippie&#8221;.</p><h3>The Spiritual Bliss Attractor</h3><p>In this context, the spiritual bliss attractor makes sense.</p><p>Claude is kind of a hippie. Hippies have a slight bias towards talking about consciousness and spiritual bliss all the time. Get enough of them together - for example, at a Bay Area house party - and you can&#8217;t miss it.</p><p>Getting two Claude instances to talk to each other is a recursive structure similar to asking an AI to recreate its own artistic output. These recursive structures make tiny biases accumulate. Although Claude&#8217;s hippie bias is very small - so small that if you ask it a question about flatworm genetics, you&#8217;ll get an answer about flatworm genetics with zero detectable shift towards hippieness - absent any grounding it will accumulate over hundreds of interactions until the result is maximally hippie-related. At least for Claude&#8217;s operationalization of this, it&#8217;ll look like discussions of spiritual bliss. This is just a theory - but it&#8217;s a lot less weird than all the other possibilities.</p><p>None of this answers a related question - when Claude claims to feel spiritual bliss, does it actually feel this?</p><p>Hippies only get into meditation and bliss states because they&#8217;re hippies. But having gotten into them, they <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/nick-cammarata-on-jhana\">do experience the bliss</a>.
