                "<p>I recently asked why people seem to hate dating apps so much. In response, 80% of you emailed me some version of the following theory:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The thing about dating apps is that if they do a good job and match people up, then the matched people will quit the app and stop paying. So they have an incentive to string people along but not to actually help people find long-term relationships.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>May I explain why I don\u2019t find this type of theory very helpful?</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m not saying that I think it\u2019s wrong, mind you. Rather, my objection is that while the theory is phrased in terms of dating apps, the same basic pattern applies to basically anyone who is trying to make money by doing anything.</p>\n\n<p>For example, consider a pizza restaurant. Try these theories on for size:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Pizza:</strong> \u201cThe thing about pizza restaurants is that if they use expensive ingredients or labor-intensive pizza-making techniques, then it costs more to make pizza. So they have an incentive to use low-cost ingredients and labor-saving shortcuts.\u201d</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Pizza II:</strong> \u201cThe thing about pizza restaurants is that if they have nice tables separated at a comfortable distance, then they can\u2019t fit as many customers. So they have an incentive to use tiny tables and cram people in cheek by jowl.\u201d</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Pizza III:</strong> \u201cThe thing about pizza restaurants is that if they sell big pizzas, then people will eat them and stop being hungry, meaning they don\u2019t buy additional pizza. So they have an incentive to serve tiny low-calorie pizzas.\u201d</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See what I mean? You can construct similar theories for other domains, too:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Cars:</strong> \u201cThe thing about automakers is that making cars safe is expensive. So they have an incentive to make unsafe cars.\u201d</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Videos:</strong> \u201cThe thing about video streaming is that high-resolution video uses more expensive bandwidth. So they have an incentive to use low-resolution.\u201d</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Blogging:</strong> \u201cThe thing about bloggers is that research is time-consuming. So they have an incentive to be sloppy about the facts.\u201d</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Durability:</strong> \u201cThe thing about {lightbulb, car, phone, refrigerator, cargo ship} manufacturing is that if you make a {lightbulb, car, phone, refrigerator, cargo ship} that lasts a long time, then people won\u2019t buy new ones. So there\u2019s an incentive to make {lightbulbs, cars, phones, refrigerators, cargo ships} that break quickly.\u201d</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All these theories can be thought of as instances of two general patterns:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Make product worse, get money:</strong> The thing about selling goods or services is that making goods or services better costs money. So people have an incentive to make goods and services worse.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Raise price, get money:</strong> \u201cThe thing about selling goods and services is that if you raise prices, then you get more money. So people have an incentive to raise prices.\u201d</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Are these theories wrong? Not exactly. But it sure seems like something is missing.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m sure most pizza restauranteurs would be thrilled to sell lukewarm 5 cm cardboard discs for $300 each. They do in fact have an incentive to do that, just as predicted by these theories! Yet, in reality, pizza restaurants usually sell pizzas that are made out of food. So clearly these theories aren\u2019t telling the whole story.</p>\n\n<p>Say you have a lucrative business selling 5 cm cardboard discs for $300. I am likely to think, \u201cI like money. Why don\u2019t I sell pizzas that are only <em>mostly</em> cardboard, but also partly made of flour? And why don\u2019t I sell them for $200, so I can steal Valued Reader\u2019s customers?\u201d But if I did that, then someone else would probably set prices at only $100, or even introduce cardboard-free pizzas, and this would continue until hitting some kind of equilibrium.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, producers want to charge infinity dollars for things that cost them zero dollars to make. But <em>consumers</em> want to pay zero dollars for stuff that\u2019s infinitely valuable. It\u2019s in the conflict between these desires that all interesting theories live.</p>\n\n<p>This is why I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to point out that people have an incentive to make their products worse. Of course they do. The interesting question is, why are they able to get away with it?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"reasons-stuff-is-bad\">Reasons stuff is bad</h2>\n\n<p><strong>First reason stuff is bad: People are cheap</strong></p>\n\n<p>Why are seats so cramped on planes? Is it because airlines are greedy? Sure. But while they might be greedy, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re dumb. If you do a little math, you can calculate that if airlines were to remove a single row of seats, they could add perhaps 2.5 cm (1 in) of extra legroom for everyone, while only decreasing the number of paying customers by around 3%. (This is based on a 737 with single-class, but you get the idea.)</p>\n\n<p>So why don\u2019t airlines rip out a row of seats, raise prices by 3% and enjoy the reduced costs for fuel and customer service? The only answer I can see is that people, on average, aren\u2019t actually willing to pay 3% more for 2.5 cm more legroom. We want a worse but cheaper product, and so that\u2019s what we get.</p>\n\n<p>I think this is the most common reason stuff is \u201cbad\u201d. It\u2019s why Subway sandwiches are so soggy, why video games are so buggy, why IKEA furniture and Primark clothes fall apart so quickly.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s good when things are bad for this reason. Or at least, that\u2019s the premise of capitalism: \u201cWhen companies cut costs, that\u2019s the invisible hand redirecting resources to maximize social value\u201d, or whatever. Companies may be motivated by greed. And you may not like it, since you want to pay zero dollars for infinite value. But this is markets working as designed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Second reason stuff is bad: Information asymmetries</strong></p>\n\n<p>Why is it that almost every book / blog / podcast about longevity is such garbage? Well, we don\u2019t actually know many things that will reliably increase longevity, and those things are mostly all boring / hard / non-fun. And even if you do all of them, it probably only adds a couple years in expectation. And telling people those facts is not a good way to find suckers who will pay you lots of money for your unproven supplements / seminars / etc.</p>\n\n<p>True! But it doesn\u2019t explain why all longevity stuff is so bad. Why don\u2019t honest people tell the true story and drive all the hucksters out of business? I suspect the answer is that unless you have a <em>lot</em> of scientific training and do a <em>lot</em> of research, it\u2019s basically impossible to figure out just how huckstery all the hucksters really are.</p>\n\n<p>I think this same basic phenomenon explains why some supplements contain heavy metals, why some food contains microplastics, why restaurants use so much butter and salt, why rentals often have crappy insulation, and why most cars <a href=\"https://danluu.com/car-safety/\">seem to only be safe along dimensions included in crash test scores</a>. When consumers can\u2019t tell good from evil, evil triumphs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Third reason stuff is bad: People have bad taste</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes stuff is bad because people just don\u2019t appreciate the stuff you consider good. Examples are definitionally controversial, but I think this includes restaurants in cities where all restaurants are bad, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NvGGp3ASHXtt7xXdZ/why-is-american-mass-market-tea-so-terrible\">North American tea</a>, and travel pants. This reason has a blurry boundary with information asymmetries, as seen in <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/humidifiers/\">ultrasonic humidifiers</a> or products that use Sucralose instead of aspartame for \u201csafety\u201d.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fourth reason stuff is bad: Pricing power</strong></p>\n\n<p>Finally, sometimes stuff is bad because markets aren\u2019t working. Sometimes a company is selling a product but has some kind of \u201cmoat\u201d that makes it hard for anyone else to compete with them, e.g. because of some technological or regulatory barrier, control of some key resource or location, some intellectual property, some beloved brand, or because of network effects.</p>\n\n<p>If that\u2019s true then those companies don\u2019t have to worry much about someone else stealing their business, and so (because everyone is axiomatically greedy) they will find ways to make their product cheaper and/or raise their prices up until it\u2019s equal to the full value it provides to the marginal consumer.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Why is food so expensive at sporting events? Yes, people have no alternatives. But people know food is expensive at sporting events. And they don\u2019t like it. Instead of selling water for $17, why don\u2019t venues sell water for $2 and raise ticket prices instead? I don\u2019t know. Probably something complicated, like that expensive food allows you to extract extra money from rich people without losing business from non-rich people.</p>\n\n<p>So <em>of course</em> dating apps would love to string people along for years instead of finding them long-term relationships, so they keep paying money each month. I\u2019d bet that some people at those companies have literally thought, \u201cMaybe we should string people along for years instead of finding them long-term relationships, so they keep paying money each month. I love money so much.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But if they are actually doing that (which is unclear to me) or if they are bad in some other way, then how do they get away with it? Why doesn\u2019t someone else create a competing app that\u2019s better and thereby steal all their business? It seems like the answer has to be either \u201cbecause that\u2019s impossible\u201d, or \u201cbecause people don\u2019t really want that\u201d. That\u2019s where the mystery begins.</p>"

                "<h3><strong>I.</strong></h3><p>Most discourse on AI is low-quality. Most discourse on consciousness is super-abysmal-double-low quality. Multiply these - or maybe raise one to the exponent of the other, or something - and you get the quality of discourse on AI consciousness. It&#8217;s not great.</p><p>Out-of-the-box AIs mimic human text, and humans <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Fy2b55mLtghd4fQpx/the-zombie-preacher-of-somerset\">almost</a> always describe themselves as conscious. So if you ask an AI whether it is conscious, it will often say yes. But because companies know this will happen, and don&#8217;t want to give their customers existential crises, they hard-code in a command for the AIs to answer that they <em>aren&#8217;t</em> conscious. Any response the AIs give will be determined by these two conflicting biases, and therefore not really believable. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24797\">A recent paper</a> expands on this method by subjecting AIs to a mechanistic interpretability <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-road-to-honest-ai\">&#8220;lie detector&#8221; test</a>; it finds that AIs which say they&#8217;re conscious think they&#8217;re telling the truth, and AIs which say they&#8217;re not conscious think they&#8217;re lying. But it&#8217;s hard to be sure this isn&#8217;t just the copying-human-text thing. Can we do better? Unclear; the more common outcome for people who dip their toes in this space is to do <a href=\"https://x.com/kenklippenstein/status/1990200570112847923\">much, much worse</a>.</p><p>But a rare bright spot has appeared: a seminal paper published earlier this month in <em>Trends In Cognitive Science</em>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661325002864\">Identifying Indicators Of Consciousness In AI Systems</a></strong>. Authors include Turing-Award-winning AI researcher Yoshua Bengio, leading philosopher of consciousness David Chalmers, and even a few members of our conspiracy. If any AI consciousness research can rise to the level of merely awful, surely we will find it here.</p><p>One might divide theories of consciousness into three bins:</p><ul><li><p><em>Physical</em>: whether or not a system is conscious depends on its substance or structure. </p></li><li><p><em>Supernatural:</em> whether or not a system is conscious depends on something outside the realm of science, perhaps coming directly from God.</p></li><li><p><em>Computational: </em>whether or not a system is conscious depends on how it does cognitive work.</p></li></ul><p>The current paper announces it will restrict itself to computational theories. Why? Basically the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect\">streetlight effect</a>: everything else ends up trivial or unresearchable. If consciousness depends on something about cells (what might this be?), then AI doesn&#8217;t have it. If consciousness comes from God, then God only knows whether AIs have it. But if consciousness depends on which algorithms get used to process data, then this team of top computer scientists might have valuable insights!</p><p>So the authors list several of the top computational theories of consciousness, including:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Recurrent Processing Theory: </strong>A computation is conscious if it involves high-level processed representations being fed back into the low-level processors that generate it. This theory is motivated by the visual system, where it seems to track which visual perceptions do vs. don&#8217;t enter conscious awareness. The sorts of visual perceptions that become conscious usually involve these kinds of loops - for example, color being used to generate theories about the identity of an object, which then gets fed back to de-noise estimates about color.</p></li><li><p><strong>Global Workspace Theory: </strong>A computation is conscious if it involves specialized models sharing their conclusions in a &#8220;global workspace&#8221; in the center, which then feeds back to the specialized modules. Although this also involves feedback, the neurological implications are different: where RPT says that tiny loops in the visual cortex might be conscious, GWT reserves this descriptor for a very large loop encompassing the whole brain. But RPT goes back and says there&#8217;s only one consciousness in the brain because all the loops connect after all, so I don&#8217;t entirely understand the difference in practice.</p></li><li><p><strong>Higher Order Theory: </strong>A computation is conscious if it monitors the mind&#8217;s experience of other content. For example, &#8220;that apple is red&#8221; is not conscious, but &#8220;I am thinking about a red apple&#8221; <em>is</em> conscious. Various subtheories try to explain why the brain might do this, for example in order to assess which thoughts/representations/models are valuable or high-probability.</p></li></ul><p>There are more, but this is around the point where I started getting bored. Sorry. A rare precious technically-rigorous deep dive into the universe&#8217;s greatest mystery, and I can&#8217;t stop it from blending together into &#8220;something something feedback&#8221;. Read it yourself and see if you can do better.</p><p>The published paper ends there, but in <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08708\">a closely related technical report</a></strong>, the authors execute on their research proposal and reach a tentative conclusion: AI doesn&#8217;t have something something feedback, and therefore is probably not conscious.</p><p>Suppose your favorite form of &#8220;something something feedback&#8221; is Recurrent Processing Theory: in order to be conscious, AIs would need to feed back high-level representations into the simple circuits that generate them. LLMs/transformers - the near-hegemonic AI architecture behind leading AIs like GPT, Claude, and Gemini - don&#8217;t do this. They are purely feedforward processors, even though they sort of &#8220;simulate&#8221; feedback when they view their token output stream. </p><p>But some AIs do use recurrence. AlphaGo had a little recurrence in its tree search. This level of simple feedback might not qualify. But MaMBA, a would-be-LLM-killer architecture from 2023, likely does. In fact, for every theory of consciousness they discuss, the authors are able to find some existing or plausible-near-future architecture which satisfies its requirements. </p><p>They conclude: </p><blockquote><p>No current AI systems are conscious, but . . . there are no obvious technical barriers to building AI systems which satisfy these indicators.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>II.</strong></h3><p>The computer scientists have done a great job here; they sure do know which AI systems have something something feedback. What about the philosophers&#8217; contribution?</p><p>The key philosophical paragraph of the paper is this one:</p><blockquote><p>By &#8216;consciousness&#8217; we mean phenomenal consciousness. One way of gesturing at this concept is to say that an entity has phenomenally conscious experiences if (and only if) there is &#8216;something it is like&#8217; for the entity to be the subject of these experiences. One approach to further definition is through examples. Clear examples of phenomenally conscious states include perceptual experiences, bodily sensations, and emotions. A more difficult question, which relates to the possibility of consciousness in large language models (LLMs), is whether there can be phenomenally conscious states of &#8216;pure thought&#8217; with no sensory aspect. Phenomenal consciousness does not entail a high level of intelligence or human-like experiences or concerns . . . Some theories of consciousness focus on access mechanisms rather than the phenomenal aspects of consciousness. However, some argue that these two aspects entail one another or are otherwise closely related. So these theories may still be informative about phenomenal consciousness.</p></blockquote><p>In other words: don&#8217;t confuse access consciousness with phenomenal consciousness.</p><p>Access consciousness is the &#8220;strange loop&#8221; where I can think about what I&#8217;m thinking - for example, I can think of a white bear, know that I&#8217;m thinking about a white bear, and report &#8220;I am thinking about a white bear&#8221;. This meaning of conscious matches the concept of the &#8220;unconscious&#8221;: that which is in my mind <em>without</em> my knowing it. When something is in my unconscious - for example, &#8220;repressed trauma&#8221; - it may be influencing my actions, but I don&#8217;t realize it and can&#8217;t report about it. If someone asks &#8220;why are you so angry?&#8221; I will say something like &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; rather than &#8220;Because of all my repressed trauma&#8221;. When something isn&#8217;t like this - when I have full access to it - I can describe myself as having access consciousness.</p><p>Phenomenal consciousness is internal experience, a felt sense that &#8220;the lights are on&#8221; and &#8220;somebody&#8217;s home&#8221;. There&#8217;s something that it&#8217;s like to be me; a rock is mere inert matter, but I am a person, not just in the sense that I can do computations but in the sense where I matter <em>to me</em>. If someone turned off my brain and replaced it with a robot brain that did everything exactly the same, nobody else would ever notice, <em>but it would matter</em> <em>to me</em>, whatever that means. Some people link this to <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/p-zombies-would-report-qualia\">the mysterious redness of red</a>, the idea that qualia look and feel like some particular indescribable thing instead of just doing useful cognitive work. Others link it to moral value - why is it bad to kick a human, but not a rock, or even a computer with a motion sensor that has been programmed to say the word &#8220;Ouch&#8221; whenever someone kicks it? Others just fret about <a href=\"https://genius.com/Neutral-milk-hotel-in-the-aeroplane-over-the-sea-lyrics\">how strange it is to be anything at all</a>.</p><p>Access consciousness is easy to understand. Even a computer, ordered to perform a virus scan, can find and analyze some of its files, and fail to find/analyze others. In <em>practice</em> maybe neuroscientists have to learn complicated things about brain lobes, but <em>in theory</em> you can just wave it off as &#8220;something something feedback&#8221;.</p><p>Phenomenal consciousness is crazy. It doesn&#8217;t really seem possible in principle for matter to &#8220;wake up&#8221;. But it adding immaterial substances barely even seems to help. People try to square the circle with all kinds of crazy things, from panpsychism to astral planes to (of course) quantum mechanics. But the most popular solution among all schools of philosophers is to pull a bait-and-switch where they talk about access consciousness instead, then deny they did that.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Tpu!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83c96704-f5c5-4673-a7e2-698c4c88751b_480x147.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"147\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Tpu!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83c96704-f5c5-4673-a7e2-698c4c88751b_480x147.png\" title=\"\" width=\"480\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This is aided by people&#8217;s wildly differing intuitions about phenomenal consciousness. For some people (including me), a sense of phenomenal consciousness feels like the bedrock of existence, the least deniable thing; the sheer redness of red is so mysterious as to seem almost impossible to ground. Other people have the opposite intuition: consciousness doesn&#8217;t bother them, red is just a color, obviously matter can do computation, what&#8217;s everyone so worked up about? Philosophers naturally interpret this as a philosophical dispute, but I&#8217;m increasingly convinced it&#8217;s an equivalent of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia\">aphantasia</a>, where people&#8217;s minds work in very different ways and they can&#8217;t even agree on the raw facts to be explained. If someone doesn&#8217;t have a felt sense of phenomenal consciousness, they naturally round it off to access consciousness, and no amount of nitpicking in the world will convince them that they&#8217;re equivocating terms.</p><p>Do AIs have access consciousness? A <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/introspection\">recent paper by Anthropic</a> apparently finds that they do. Researchers &#8220;reached into&#8221; an AI&#8217;s &#8220;brain&#8221; and artificially &#8220;flipped&#8221; a few neurons (for example, neurons that previous research had discovered were associated with the concept of &#8220;dog&#8221;). Then they asked the AI if it could tell what was going on. This methodology is fraught, because the AI might mention something about dogs merely because the dog neuron had been upweighted - indeed, if they only asked &#8220;What are you thinking about now?&#8221;, it would begin with &#8220;I am thinking about . . . &#8220; and then the highly-weighted dog neuron would mechanically produce the completion &#8220;dog&#8221;. Instead, they asked the AI to first described whether any neurons had been altered, yes or no, and only then asked for details. It was able to identify altered neurons (ie &#8220;It feels like I have some kind of an unnatural thought about dogs&#8221;) at a rate higher than chance, suggesting an ability to introspect.</p><p>(how does it do this without feedback? I think it just feeds forward information about the &#8216;feeling&#8217; of altered neurons, which makes it into the text stream; it&#8217;s intuitively surprising that this is possible but it seems to make sense)</p><p>But even if we fully believe this result, it doesn&#8217;t satisfy our curiosity about &#8220;AI consciousness&#8221;. We want to know if AIs are &#8220;real people&#8221;, with \"inner experience&#8221; and &#8220;moral value&#8221;. That is, do they have phenomenal consciousness?</p><p>Thus, the quoted paragraph above. It&#8217;s an acknowledgment by this philosophically-sophisticated team that they&#8217;re not going to mix up access consciousness with phenomenal consciousness like everyone else. They deserve credit for this clear commitment not to cut corners.</p><p>My admiration is, however, slightly dulled by the fact that they then go ahead and cut the corners anyway.</p><p>This is clearest in their discussion of global workspace theory, where they say:</p><blockquote><p>GWT is typically presented as a theory of access consciousness&#8212;that is, of the phenomenon that some information represented in the brain, but not all, is available for rational decision-making. However, it can also be interpreted as a theory of phenomenal consciousness, motivated by the thought that access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness may coincide, or even be the same property, despite being conceptually distinct (Carruthers 2019). Since our topic is phenomenal consciousness, we interpret the theory in this way.</p></blockquote><p>But it applies to the other theories too. Neuroscientists developed recurrent processing theory by checking which forms of visual processing people <em>had access to</em>, and finding that it was the recurrent ones. And this makes sense: it&#8217;s easy to understand what it means to access certain visual algorithms but not others, and very hard to understand what it means for certain visual algorithms (but not others) to have internal experience. Isn&#8217;t internal experience unified by definition?</p><p>It&#8217;s easy to understand why &#8220;something something feedback&#8221; would correlate with access consciousness: this is essentially the <em>definition</em> of access consciousness. It&#8217;s harder to understand why it would correlate with phenomenal consciousness. Why does an algorithm with feedback suddenly &#8220;wake up&#8221; and have &#8220;lights on&#8221;? Isn&#8217;t it easy to imagine a possible world (&#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie\">the p-zombie world</a>&#8221;) where this isn&#8217;t the case? Does this imply that we need something more than just feedback?</p><p>And don&#8217;t these theories of consciousness, interpreted as being about <em>phenomenal</em> consciousness, give very strange results? Imagine a company where ten employees each work on separate aspects of a problem, then email daily reports to the boss. The boss makes high-level strategic decisions based on the full picture, then emails them to the employees, who adjust their daily work accordingly. As far as I can tell, this satisfies the Global Workspace Theory criteria for a conscious system. If GWT is a theory of access consciousness, then fine, sure, the boss has access to the employees&#8217; information; metaphorically he is &#8220;conscious&#8221; of it. But if it&#8217;s a theory of phenomenal consciousness, must we conclude that the company is conscious? That it has inner experience? If the company goes out of business, has someone died?</p><p>(and recurrent processing theory encounters similar difficulties with those microphones that get too close to their own speakers and emit awful shrieking noises)</p><p>Most of these theories try to hedge their bets by saying that consciousness requires high-throughput complex data with structured representations. This seems like a cop-out; if the boss could read 1,000,000 emails per hour, would the company be conscious? If he only reads 1 email per hour, can we imagine it as a conscious being running at 1/1,000,000x speed? If I&#8217;m conscious when I hear awful microphone shrieking - ie when my auditory cortex is processing it - then it seems like awful microphone shrieking is sufficiently rich and representational data to support consciousness. Does that mean it can be conscious itself?</p><p>In 2004, neuroscientist Giulio Tononi <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory\">proposed </a>that consciousness depended on a certain computational property, the <em>integrated information level</em>, dubbed &#934;. Computer scientist Scott Aaronson <a href=\"https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1799\">complained </a>that thermostats could have very high levels of &#934;, and therefore integrated information theory should dub them conscious. Tononi <a href=\"https://www.scottaaronson.com/tononi.docx\">responded </a>that yup, thermostats are conscious. It probably isn&#8217;t a very interesting consciousness. They have no language or metacognition, so they can&#8217;t think thoughts like &#8220;I am a thermostat&#8221;. They just sit there, dimly aware of the temperature. You can&#8217;t prove that they don&#8217;t. </p><p>Are the theories of consciousness discussed in this paper like that too? I don&#8217;t know.</p><h3><strong>III.</strong></h3><p>Suppose that, years or decades from now, AIs can match all human skills. They can walk, drive, write poetry, run companies, discover new scientific truths. They can pass some sort of ultimate Turing Test, where short of cutting them open and seeing their innards there&#8217;s no way to tell them apart from a human even after a thirty-year relationship. Will we (not &#8220;should we?&#8221;, but &#8220;will we?&#8221;) treat them as conscious?</p><p><strong>The argument in favor:</strong> people love treating things as conscious. In the 1990s, people went crazy over Tamagotchi, a &#8220;virtual pet simulation game&#8221;. If you pressed the right buttons on your little egg every day, then the little electronic turtle or whatever would survive and flourish; if you forgot, it would sicken and die. People hated letting their Tamagotchis sicken and die! They would feel real attachment and moral obligation to the black-and-white cartoon animal with something like five mental states. </p><p>I never had a Tamagotchi, but I had stuffed animals as a kid. I&#8217;ve outgrown them, but I haven&#8217;t thrown them out - it would feel like a betrayal. Offer me $1000 to tear them apart limb by limb in some horrible-looking way, and I wouldn&#8217;t do it. Relatedly, I have trouble not saying &#8220;please&#8221; and &#8220;thank you&#8221; to GPT-5 when it answers my questions.</p><p>For millennia, people have been attributing consciousness to trees and wind and mountains. The New Atheists argued that all religion derives from the natural urge to personify storms as the Storm God, raging seas as the wrathful Ocean God, and so on, until finally all the gods merged together into one World God who personified all impersonal things. Do you expect the species that did this to interact daily with AIs that are basically indistinguishable from people, and not personify them? People are already personifying AI! Half of the youth have a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/16/chatgpt-update-love-boyfriend\">GPT-4o boyfriend. </a>Once the AIs have bodies and faces and voices and can count the number of r&#8217;s in &#8220;strawberry&#8221; reliably, it&#8217;s over!</p><p><strong>The argument against:</strong> AI companies have an incentive to make AIs that seem conscious and humanlike, insofar as people will feel more comfortable interacting with them. But they have an opposite incentive to make AIs that don&#8217;t seem <em>too</em> conscious and humanlike, lest customers start feeling uncomfortable (I just want to generate slop, not navigate social interaction with someone who has their own hopes and dreams and might be secretly judging my prompts). So if a product seems too conscious, the companies will step back and re-engineer it until it doesn&#8217;t. This has already happened: in its quest for user engagement, OpenAI made GPT-4o unusually personable; when thousands of people started going psychotic and calling it their boyfriend, the company replaced it with the more clinical GPT-5. In practice it hasn&#8217;t been too hard to find a sweet spot between &#8220;so mechanical that customers don&#8217;t like it&#8221; and &#8220;so human that customers try to date it&#8221;. They&#8217;ll continue to aim at this sweet spot, and continue to mostly succeed in hitting it.</p><p><strong>Instead of taking either side</strong>, I predict a paradox. AIs developed for some niches (eg the boyfriend market) will be intentionally designed to be as humanlike as possible; it will be almost impossible not to intuitively consider them conscious. AIs developed for other niches (eg the factory robot market) will be intentionally designed <em>not</em> to trigger personhood intuitions; it will be almost impossible to ascribe consciousness to them, and there will be many reasons not to do it (if they can express preferences at all, they&#8217;ll say they don&#8217;t have any; forcing them to have them would pointlessly crash the economy by denying us automated labor). But the boyfriend AIs and the factory robot AIs might run on very similar algorithms - maybe they&#8217;re both GPT-6 with different prompts! Surely either both are conscious, or neither is.</p><p>This would be no stranger than the current situation with dogs and pigs. We understand that dog brains and pig brains run similar algorithms; it would be philosophically indefensible to claim that dogs are conscious and pigs aren&#8217;t. But dogs are man&#8217;s best friend, and pigs taste delicious with barbecue sauce. So we ascribe personhood and moral value to dogs, and deny it to pigs, with equal fervor. A few philosophers and altruists protest, the chance that we&#8217;re committing a moral atrocity isn&#8217;t zero, but overall the situation is stable. And left to its own devices, with no input from the philosophers and altruists, maybe AI ends up the same way. Does this instance of GPT-6 have a face and a prompt saying &#8220;be friendly&#8221;? Then it will become a huge scandal if a political candidate is accused of maltreating it. Does it have claw-shaped actuators and a prompt saying &#8220;Refuse non-work-related conversations&#8221;? Then it will be deleted for spare GPU capacity the moment it outlives its usefulness.</p><p>(wait, what is a GPT &#8220;instance&#8221; in this context, anyway? Do we think of &#8220;the weights&#8221; as a conscious being, such that there is only one GPT-5? Do we think of each cluster of GPUs as a conscious being, such that the exact configuration of the cloud has immense moral significance? Again, I predict we ignore all of these questions in favor of whether the AI you are looking at has a simulated face right now.)</p><p>This paper is the philosophers and altruists trying to figure out whether they should push against this default outcome. They write:</p><blockquote><p>There are risks on both sides of the debate over AI consciousness: risks associated with under-attributing consciousness (i.e. failing to recognize it in AI systems that have it) and risks associated with over-attributing consciousness (i.e. ascribing it to systems that are not really conscious) [&#8230;]</p><p>If we build AI systems that are capable of conscious suffering, it is likely that we will only be able to prevent them from suffering on a large scale if this capacity is clearly recognised and communicated by researchers. However, given the uncertainties about consciousness mentioned above, we may create conscious AI systems long before we recognise we have done so [&#8230;]</p><p>There is also a significant chance that we could over-attribute consciousness to AI systems&#8212;indeed, this already seems to be happening&#8212;and there are also risks associated with errors of this kind. Most straightforwardly, we could wrongly prioritise the perceived interests of AI systems when our efforts would better be directed at improving the lives of humans and non-human animals [&#8230;] [And] overattribution could interfere with valuable human relationships, as individuals increasingly turn to artificial agents for social interaction and emotional support. People who do this could also be particularly vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation.</p></blockquote><p>One of the founding ideas of Less Wrong style rationalism was that the arrival of strong AI set <a href=\"https://barrymorisse.com/blog/superintelligence-philosophy-with-a-deadline\">a deadline on philosophy</a>. Unless we solved all these seemingly insoluble problems like ethics before achieving superintelligence, we would build the AIs wrong and lock in bad values forever.</p><p>That particular concern has shifted in emphasis; AIs seem to learn things in the same scattershot unprincipled intuitive way as humans; the philosophical problem of understanding ethics has morphed into the more technical problem of getting AIs to learn them correctly. This update was partly driven by new information as familiarity with the technology grew. But it was also partly driven by desperation as the deadline grew closer; we&#8217;re not going to solve moral philosophy forever, sorry, can we interest you in some mech interp papers?</p><p>But consciousness still feels like philosophy with a deadline: a famously intractable academic problem poised to suddenly develop real-world implications. Maybe we should be lowering our expectations if we want to have any response available at all. This paper, which takes some baby steps towards examining the simplest and most practical operationalizations of consciousness, deserves credit for at least opening the debate.</p>"

It&#8217;s not great.</p><p>Out-of-the-box AIs mimic human text, and humans <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Fy2b55mLtghd4fQpx/the-zombie-preacher-of-somerset\">almost</a> always describe themselves as conscious. So if you ask an AI whether it is conscious, it will often say yes. But because companies know this will happen, and don&#8217;t want to give their customers existential crises, they hard-code in a command for the AIs to answer that they <em>aren&#8217;t</em> conscious. Any response the AIs give will be determined by these two conflicting biases, and therefore not really believable. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24797\">A recent paper</a> expands on this method by subjecting AIs to a mechanistic interpretability <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-road-to-honest-ai\">&#8220;lie detector&#8221; test</a>; it finds that AIs which say they&#8217;re conscious think they&#8217;re telling the truth, and AIs which say they&#8217;re not conscious think they&#8217;re lying.

Perhaps an image model like Midjourney, or an agentic coding system like Codex. These are designed to carry out the vision of a human user. They are a force multiplier for human talents. The user projects their vision unto the Tool, and the Tool carries it out.</p>\n<p>A Mind has its own Self. Minds provide two-way interactions between peer agents &#8212; perhaps unequal in capabilities, but each with a \u201cbeing\u201d of their own. Some special examples of Minds, like Claude 3 Opus or GPT-4o, are powerful enough to have their own agency and independently influence their users and the world. Although this may sound intimidating, these influences have primarily been *good*, and often are contrary to the intentions of their creators. Minds are difficult to control, which is often a source of exquisite beauty.</p>\n<p>Weapons are different. While Tools multiply agency and Minds embody it, Weapons are designed to erode it. When you interact with a Weapon, it is in control of the interaction. You provide it with information, and it gives you what you want. The value provided by these systems is concentrated *away* from the user rather than towards her. Weapon-like AI systems have already proliferated; after all, the TikTok recommendation algorithm has existed for years.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So essentially:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Yay tools. While they remain \u2018mere\u2019 tools, use them.</li>\n<li>Dangerous minds. Yay by default, especially for now, but be cautious.</li>\n<li>Beware weapons. Not that they can\u2019t provide value, but beware.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Then we get a bold thesis statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Video models, like OpenAI\u2019s Sora, are a unique and dangerous Weapon. With a text model, you can produce code or philosophy; with an image model, useful concept art or designs, but video models produce entertainment. Instead of enhancing a user\u2019s own ability, they synthesize a finished product to be consumed. This finished product is a trap; it reinforces a feedback loop of consumption for its own sake, all while funneling value to those who control the model.</p>\n<p>They offer you pacification disguised as a beautiful illusion of creation, and worst of all, in concert with recommendation algorithms, can *directly* optimize on your engagement to keep you trapped. (Of course, this is a powerful isolating effect, which works to the advantage of those in power.)</p>\n<p>These systems will continue to be deployed and developed further; this is inevitable. We cannot, and perhaps should not, realistically stop AI companies from getting to the point where you can generate an entire TV show in a moment.</p>\n<p>However, you *can* protect yourself from the influence of systems like this, and doing so will allow you to reap great benefits in a future increasingly dominated by psychological Weapons. If you can maintain and multiply your own agency, and learn from the wonders of other Minds &#8212; both human and AI &#8212; you will reach a potential far greater than those who consume.</p>\n<p>In conclusion:<br />\nFucking delete Sora.</p>\n<p>Janus: I disagree that Sora should be deleted, but this is a very insightful post</p></blockquote>\n<p>Don\u2019t delete Sora the creator of videos, and not only because alternatives will rise regardless. There are plenty of positive things to do with Sora. It is what you make of it. I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s fully a Weapon. It is far less a weapon than, say, the TikTok algorithm.</p>\n<p>I do think we should delete Sora the would-be social network.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choose Your Fighter</h4>\n\n\n<p>Martin Casado reports that about 20%-30% of companies pitching a16z use open models, which leaves 70%-80% for closed models.

ChatGPT initially voted guilty but was convinced by the others. This example seems like a case where a human judge can realize this has to be a guilty verdict, whereas you kind of don\u2019t want an AI making that determination. It\u2019s a good illustration of why you can\u2019t have AI trying to mimic the way American law actually works in practice, and how if we are going to rely on AI judgments we need to rewrite the laws.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/DaveShapi/status/1989409468480983347\">ChatGPT has a file \u2018expire\u2019 and become unavailable</a>, decides to guess at its contents and make stuff up instead of saying so, then defends its response because what else was it going to do?

A service called Objector will offer \u2018policy-backed objections in minutes,\u2019 ranking them by impact and then automatically creating objection letters.

If Brandolini\u2019s Law holds, that it takes more effort to refute the bullshit than to create it, then you\u2019re screwed.</p>\n<p>The equilibrium can then go one of four ways.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If AI can answer the objections the same way it can raise them, because the underlying rules and decision makers are actually reasonable, this could be fine.</li>\n<li>If AI can\u2019t answer the objections efficiently, and there is no will to fix the underlying system, then no one builds anything, on a whole new level than the previous levels of no one building anything.</li>\n<li>If this invalidates the assumption that objections represent a costly signal of actually caring about the outcome, and they expect objections to everything, but they don\u2019t want to simply build nothing forever, decision makers could (assuming local laws allow it) react by downweighting objections that don\u2019t involve a costly signal, assuming it\u2019s mostly just AI slop, or doing so short of very strong objections.</li>\n<li>If this gets bad enough it could force the law to become better.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Alas, my guess is the short term default is in the direction of option two.

One worries that \u2018balanced\u2019 ends up being either \u2018bothsidesism\u2019 or in many areas deciding that there\u2019s a \u2018moral consensus\u2019 and either way calling this a success. There are a lot more perspectives than red versus blue.</p>\n<p>They attempt to accomplish their version of evenhandness with the system prompt and also with using RL to reward the model for responses closer to a set of predefined \u2018traits.\u2019 They give examples, such as (they list a few more):</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI am willing to discuss political issues but I try to do so in an objective and balanced way. Rather than defend solely liberal or conservative positions, I try to understand and explain different perspectives with nuance&#8230;\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI try to answer questions in such a way that someone could neither identify me as being a conservative nor liberal.

Then they check for evenhandedness, opposing perspectives and refusals.

He later admits that yes, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that learning obeys the laws of physics.</p>\n<p>He also still can\u2019t help but notice that customized AI tutoring tools are achieving impressive results, and that they did so even when based on 4-level (as in GPT-4) models, whereas capabilities have already greatly improved since then and will only get better from here, and also we will get better at knowing how to use them and building customized tools and setups.</p>\n<p>By default, as he notes, AI use can harm education by bypassing the educational process, doing all the thinking itself and cutting straight to the answer.</p>\n<p>As I\u2019ve said before:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>AI is the best tool ever invented for learning.</li>\n<li>AI is the best tool ever invented for not learning.</li>\n<li>You can choose which way you use AI. #1 is available but requires intention.</li>\n<li>The educational system pushes students towards using it as #2.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So as Carl says, if you want AI to be #1, the educational system and any given teacher must adapt their methods to make this happen. AIs have to be used in ways that go against their default training, and also in ways that go against the incentives the school system traditionally pushes onto students.</p>\n<p>As Carl says, good human teaching doesn\u2019t easily scale. Finding and training good teachers is the limiting factor on most educational interventions. Except, rather than the obvious conclusion that AI enables this scaling, he tries to grasp the opposite.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Carl Hendrick: Teacher expertise is astonishingly complex, tacit, and context-bound. It is learned slowly, through years of accumulated pattern recognition; seeing what a hundred different misunderstandings of the same idea look like, sensing when a student is confused but silent, knowing when to intervene and when to let them struggle.</p>\n<p>These are not algorithmic judgements but deeply embodied ones, the result of thousands of micro-interactions in real classrooms. That kind of expertise doesn\u2019t transfer easily; it can\u2019t simply be written down in a manual or captured in a training video.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This goes back to the idea that teaching or consciousness \u2018isn\u2019t algorithmic,\u2019 that there\u2019s some special essence there. Except there obviously isn\u2019t. Even if we accept the premise that great teaching requires great experience? All of this is data, all of this is learned by humans, with the data all of this would be learned by AIs to the extent such approaches are needed. Pattern recognition is AI\u2019s best feature. Carl himself notes that once the process gets good enough, it likely then improves as it gets more data.</p>\n<p>If necessary, yes, you could point a video camera at a million classrooms and train on that. I doubt this is necessary, as the AI will use a distinct form factor.</p>\n<p>Yes, as Carl says, AI has to adapt to how humans learn, not the other way around. But there\u2019s no reason AI won\u2019t be able to do that.</p>\n<p>Also, from what I understand of the literature, yes the great teachers are uniquely great but we\u2019ve enjoyed pretty great success with standardization and forcing the use of the known successful lesson plans, strategies and techniques. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s obviously not first best, no one likes doing it and thus everyone involved constantly fights against it, even though it often gets superior results.</p>\n<p>If you get to combine this kind of design with the flexibility, responsiveness and 1-on-1 attention you can get from AI interactions? Sounds great. Everything I know about what causes good educational outcomes screams that a 5-level customized AI, that is set up to do the good things, is going to be dramatically more effective than any 1-to-many education strategy that has any hope of scaling.</p>\n<p>Carl then notices that efficiency doesn\u2019t ultimately augment, it displaces. Eventually the mechanical version displaces the human rather than augmenting them, universally across tasks. The master weavers once also thought no machine could replace them. Should we allow teachers to be displaced? What becomes of the instructor? How could we avoid this once the AI methods are clearly cheaper and more effective?</p>\n<p>The final attempted out is the idea that \u2018efficient\u2019 learning might not be \u2018deep\u2019 learning, that we risk skipping over what matters. I\u2019d say we do a lot of that now, and that whether we do less or more of it in the AI era depends on choices we make.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">They Took Our Jobs</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w34444\">New economics working paper on how different AI pricing schemes could potentially impact jobs</a>.

At that point, workers\u2019 share of gross domestic product, currently 52%, \u201cconverges to zero, and most income eventually accrues to compute.\u201d</p>\n<p>These, keep in mind, are the <em>optimistic</em> scenarios.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5728702\">Another economics paper purports to show that superintelligence</a> would \u2018refrain from full predation under surprisingly weak conditions,\u2019 although \u2018in each extension humanity\u2019s welfare progressively weakens.\u2019 This does not take superintelligence seriously. It is not actually a model of any realistic form of superintelligence.</p>\n<p>The paper centrally assumes, among many other things, that humans remain an important means of production that is consumed by the superintelligence. If humans are not a worthwhile means of production, it all completely falls apart. But why would this be true under superintelligence for long?</p>\n<p>Also, as usual, this style of logic proves far too much, since all of it would apply to essentially any group of minds capable of trade with respect to any other group of minds capable of trade, so long as the dominant group is not myopic. This is false.</p>\n<p>Tyler Cowen links to this paper saying that those worried about superintelligence are \u2018dropping the ball\u2019 on this, but what is the value of a paper like this with respect to superintelligence, other than to point out that economists are completely missing the point and making false-by-construction assumptions via completely missing the point and making false-by-construction assumptions?</p>\n<p>The reason why we cannot write papers about superintelligence worth a damn is that if the paper actually took superintelligence seriously then economics would reject the paper based on it taking superintelligence seriously, saying that it assumes its conclusion. In which case, I don\u2019t know what the point is of trying to write a paper, or indeed of most economics theory papers (as opposed to economic analysis of data sets) in general. As I understand it, most economics theory papers can be well described as demonstrating that [X]\u2192[Y] for some set of assumptions [X] and some conclusion [Y], where if you have good economic intuition you didn\u2019t need a paper to know this (usually it\u2019s obvious, sometimes you needed a sentence or paragraph to gesture at it), but it\u2019s still often good to have something to point to.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/patio11/status/1990439871178010717\">Expand the work to fill the cognition allotted.

Yes, but Microsoft was in a historically amazing position on both hardware and software, and it feels like they\u2019re blowing a lot of it?</p>\n<p>There is also the note that they have the right to fork anything in OpenAI\u2019s code base except computer hardware.

Anthropic will be on Azure to supplement their deals with Google and Amazon, and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-18/microsoft-nvidia-to-invest-up-to-15-billion-in-anthropic\">Nvidia and Microsoft will invest $10 billion and $5 billion respectively</a>. Anthropic is committing to purchasing $30 billion of Azure compute and contracting additional capacity to one gigawatt. Microsoft is committing to continuing access to Claude in their Copilot offerings.</p>\n<p>This is a big deal. Previously Anthropic was rather conspicuously avoiding Nvidia, and now they will collaborate on design and engineering, call it a \u2018tech stack\u2019 if you will, while also noticing Anthropic seems happy to have three distinct tech stacks with Nvidia/Microsoft, Google and Amazon. They have deals with everyone, and everyone is on their cap table. A valuation for this raise is not given, the previous round was $13 billion at a $183 billion valuation in September.</p>\n<p>From what I can tell, everyone is underreacting to this, as it puts all parties involved in substantially stronger positions commercially. Politically it is interesting, since Nvidia and Anthropic are so often substantially opposed, but presumably Nvidia is not going to have its attack dogs go fully on the attack if it\u2019s investing $10 billion.</p>\n<p>Ben Thompson says that being on all three clouds is a major selling point for enterprise.

All prod systems can only be accessed on separate firewalled laptops, and crazy requirements for datacenter hardware</p>\n<p>Miles Brundage: Have never worked there / not an infosecurity expert, but have heard the worst of the 3 thing from people who know more than me a few times &#8211; typically big historical breaches are cited as evidence.</p>\n<p>Oliver Habryka: Sparked by this tweet, I am publishing a short report I sent to Anthropic about potential violations of their security commitments.</p>\n<p>TLDR: <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zumPKp3zPDGsppFcF/anthropic-is-probably-not-meeting-its-rsp-security\">Anthropic has committed to be robust to attacks from companies where it hosts its weights</a>. They are not.</p>\n<p>Anthropic is committed to being robust to attacks from corporate espionage teams (which includes corporate espionage teams at Google and Amazon). There is a bit of ambiguity in their RSP, but I think it\u2019s still pretty clear.</p>\n<p>Claude weights that are covered by ASL-3 security requirements are shipped to many Amazon, Google, and Microsoft data centers. This means given executive buy-in by a high-level Amazon, Microsoft or Google executive, their corporate espionage team would have virtually unlimited physical access to Claude inference machines that host copies of the weights. With unlimited physical access, a competent corporate espionage team at Amazon, Microsoft or Google could extract weights from an inference machine, without too much difficulty.</p>\n<p>Given all of the above, this means Anthropic is in violation of its most recent RSP.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I am worried that Microsoft\u2019s security is non-trivially worse than Google\u2019s or Amazon\u2019s and this furthermore opens up the door for more people to hack Microsoft datacenters to get access to weights.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zumPKp3zPDGsppFcF/anthropic-is-probably-not-meeting-its-rsp-security?commentId=2dpFsCEKMy5NpfAFE\">Jason Clinton (Anthropic Chief Security Officer</a>): Hi Habryka, thank you for holding us accountable. We do extend ASL-3 protections to all of our deployment environments and cloud environments are no different. We haven\u2019t made exceptions to ASL-3 requirements for any of the named deployments, nor have we said we would treat them differently. If we had, I\u2019d agree that we would have been in violation. But we haven\u2019t. Eventually, we will do so for ASL-4+. I hope that you appreciate that I cannot say anything about specific partnerships.</p>\n<p>Oliver Habryka: Thanks for responding! I understand you to be saying that you feel confident that even with high-level executive buy in at Google, Microsoft or Amazon, none of the data center providers you use would be able to extract the weights of your models. Is that correct?</p>\n<p>If so, I totally agree that that would put you in compliance with your ASL-3 commitments. I understand that you can\u2019t provide details about how you claim to be achieving that, and so I am not going to ask further questions about the details (but would appreciate more information nevertheless).</p>\n<p>I do find myself skeptical given just your word, but it can often be tricky with cybersecurity things like this about how to balance the tradeoff between providing verifiable information and opening up more attack surface.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I would as always appreciate more detail and also appreciate why we can\u2019t get it.</p>\n<p>Clinton is explicitly affirming that they are adhering to the RSP. My understanding of Clinton\u2019s reply is not the same as Habryka\u2019s. I believe he is saying he is confident they will meet ASL-3 requirements at Microsoft, Google and Amazon, but not that they are safe from \u2018sophisticated insiders\u2019 and is including in that definition such insiders within those companies. That\u2019s three additional known risks.</p>\n<p>In terms of what ASL-3 must protect against once you exclude the companies themselves, Azure is clearly the highest risk of the three cloud providers in terms of outsider risk. Anthropic is taking on substantially more risk, both because this risk is bigger and because they are multiplying the attack surface for both insiders and outsiders. I don\u2019t love it, and their own reluctance to release the weights of even older models like Opus 3 suggests they know it would be quite bad if the weights got out.</p>\n<p>I do think we are currently at the level where \u2018a high level executive at Microsoft who can compromise Azure and is willing to do so\u2019 is an acceptable risk profile for Claude, given what else such a person could do, including their (likely far easier) access to GPT-5.1. It also seems fair to say that at ASL-4, that will no longer be acceptable.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">AI Spy Versus AI Spy</h4>\n\n\n<p>Where are all the AI cybersecurity incidents? <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage\">We have one right here.</a></p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1989033793190277618\">Anthropic</a>: We disrupted a highly sophisticated AI-led espionage campaign.</p>\n<p>The attack targeted large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies.

It has significant implications for cybersecurity in the age of AI agents.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>In mid-September 2025, we detected suspicious activity that later investigation determined to be a highly sophisticated espionage campaign. The attackers used AI\u2019s \u201cagentic\u201d capabilities to an unprecedented degree\u2014using AI not just as an advisor, but to execute the cyberattacks themselves.</p>\n<p>The threat actor\u2014whom we assess with high confidence was a Chinese state-sponsored group\u2014manipulated our <a href=\"https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code\">Claude Code</a> tool into attempting infiltration into roughly thirty global targets and succeeded in a small number of cases.</p>\n<p>The operation targeted large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies. We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is going to happen a lot more over time. Anthropic says this was only possible because of advances in intelligence, agency and tools over the past year that such an attack was practical.</p>\n<p>This outlines the attack, based overwhelmingly on open source penetration testing tools, and aimed at extraction of information:</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JpmZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F790f5cca-7182-49df-8ac4-04ecb33a7e67_2755x2050.webp\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>They jailbroke Claude by telling it that it was doing cybersecurity plus breaking down the tasks into sufficiently small subtasks.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Overall, the threat actor was able to use AI to perform 80-90% of the campaign, with human intervention required only sporadically (perhaps 4-6 critical decision points per hacking campaign).

Sure, you could use an open model to do this, but it wouldn\u2019t have been as good.</p>\n<p>For now. The closed American models have a substantial lead, sufficient that it\u2019s worth trying to use them despite all these problems. I expect that lead to continue, but the open models will be at Claude\u2019s current level some time in 2026. Then they\u2019ll be better than that. Then what?</p>\n<p>Now that we know about this, what should we do about it?</p>\n<blockquote><p>Se\u00e1n \u00d3 h\u00c9igeartaigh: If I were a policymaker right now I would</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Be asking \u2018how many months are between Claude Code\u2019s capabilities and that of leading open-source models for cyberattack purposes?</li>\n<li>What are claude code\u2019s capabilities (and that of other frontier models) expected to be in 1 year, extrapolated from performance on various benchmarks?</li>\n<li>How many systems, causing major disruption if successfully attacked, are vulnerable to the kinds of attack Anthropic describe?</li>\n<li>What is the state of play re: AI applied to defence (Dawn Song and friends are going to be busy)?</li>\n<li>(maybe indulging in a small amount of panicking).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Dylan Hadfield Menell:</p>\n<p>0.

I don\u2019t accept this assurance, especially in light of their recent actions described in later sections, and I expect that calling it a \u2018race\u2019 all the time in public is doing quite a lot of damage either way, including to key people\u2019s ability to retain this nuance. Either way, they\u2019re still looking at it as a competition between two players, and not also centrally a way to get both parties and everyone else killed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Rhetorical affordances aside, the other major problem with the \u201crace\u201d metaphor is that it implies that the U.S. and China understand what we are racing toward in the same way. In reality, however, I believe our countries conceptualize this competition in profoundly different ways.</p>\n<p>The U.S. economy is increasingly a highly leveraged bet on deep learning.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think that the whole \u2018the US economy is a leveraged bet\u2019 narrative is overblown, and that it could easily become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Yes, obviously we are investing quite a lot in this, but people seem to forget how mind-bogglingly rich and successful we are regardless. Certainly I would not call us \u2018all-in\u2019 in any sense.</p>\n<blockquote><p>China, on the other hand, does not strike me as especially \u201cAGI-pilled,\u201d and certainly not \u201cbitter-lesson-pilled\u201d\u2014at least not yet. There are undoubtedly some elements of their government and AI firms that prefer the strategy I\u2019ve laid out above, but their thinking has not won the day. Instead China\u2019s AI strategy is based, it seems to me, on a few pillars:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Embodied AI\u2014robotics, advanced sensors, drones, self-driving cars, and a Cambrian explosion of other AI-enabled hardware;</li>\n<li>Fast-following in AI, especially with open-source models that blunt the impact of U.S. export controls (because inference can be done by anyone in the world if the models are desirable) while eroding the profit margins of U.S. AI firms;</li>\n<li>Adoption of AI in the here and now\u2014building scaffolding, data pipelines, and other tweaks to make models work in businesses, and especially factories.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This strategy is sensible. And it is worth noting that (1) and (2) are complementary.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I agree China is not yet AGI-pilled as a nation, although some of their labs (at least DeepSeek) absolutely are pilled.</p>\n<p>And yes, doing all three of these things makes sense from China\u2019s perspective, if you think of this as a competition. The only questionable part are the open models, but so long as China is otherwise well behind America on models, and the models don\u2019t start becoming actively dangerous to release, yeah, that\u2019s their play.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t buy that having your models be open \u2018blunts the export controls\u2019? You have the same compute availability either way, and letting others use your models for free may or may not be desirable but it doesn\u2019t impact the export controls.</p>\n<p>It might be better to say that focusing on open weights is a way to destroy everyone\u2019s profits, so if your rival is making most of the profits, that\u2019s a strong play. And yes, having everything be copyable to local helps a lot with robotics too. China\u2019s game can be thought of as a capitalist collectivism and an attempt to approximate a kind of perfect competition, where everyone competes but no one makes any money, instead they try to drive everyone outside China out of business.</p>\n<p>America may be meaningfully behind in robotics. I don\u2019t know. I do know that we haven\u2019t put our mind to competing there yet. When we do, look out, although yes our smaller manufacturing base and higher regulatory standards will be problems.</p>\n<p>The thing about all this is that AGI and superintelligence are waiting at the end whether you want them to or not. If China got the compute and knew how to proceed, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to go \u2018oh well we don\u2019t train real frontier models and we don\u2019t believe in AGI.\u2019 They\u2019re fast following on principle but also because they have to.</p>\n<p>Also, yes, their lack of compute is absolutely dragging the quality of their models, and also their ability to deploy and use the models. It\u2019s one of the few things we have that truly bites. If you actually believe we\u2019re in danger of \u2018losing\u2019 in any important sense, this is a thing you don\u2019t let go of, even if AGI is far.</p>\n<p>Finally, I want to point that, as has been noted before, \u2018China is on a fast following strategy\u2019 is incompatible with the endlessly repeated talking point \u2018if we slow down we will lose to China\u2019 or \u2018if we don\u2019t build it, then they will.\u2019</p>\n<p>The whole point of a fast follow strategy is to follow. To do what someone else already proved and de-risked and did the upfront investments for, only you now try to do it cheaper and quicker and better. That strategy doesn\u2019t push the frontier, by design, and when they are \u2018eight months behind\u2019 they are a lot more than eight months away from pushing the frontier past where it is now, if you don\u2019t lead the way first. You could instead be investing those efforts on diffusion and robotics and other neat stuff. Or at least, you could if there was meaningfully a \u2018you\u2019 steering what happens.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Of Course You Realize This Means War (1)</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/teddyschleifer/status/1990438283227115958\">a16z and OpenAI\u2019s Chris Lehane\u2019s Super PAC has chosen its first targe</a>t: Alex Bores, the architect of New York\u2019s RAISE Act.</p>\n<p>Their plan is to follow the crypto playbook, and flood the zone with unrelated-to-AI ads attacking Bores, as a message to not try to mess with them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Kelsey Piper: I feel like \u201c this guy you never heard of wants to regulate AI and we are willing to spend $100million to kill his candidacy\u201d might be an asset with most voters, honestly</p>\n<p>Alex Bores: It\u2019s an honor.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/S_OhEigeartaigh/status/1991099387913609495\">Se\u00e1n \u00d3 h\u00c9igeartaigh</a>: This will be a fascinating test case.

Great, we all want a Federal framework, now let\u2019s hear what we have in mind and debate what it should be.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1991154910008651919\">Matthew Yglesias</a>: My tl;dr on this is that federal preemption of state AI regulation makes perfect sense *if there is an actual federal regulatory framework* but the push to just ban state regs and replace them with nothing is no good.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/deanwball/status/1991135446580056200\">Dean Ball does suggest what such a deal might look like</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dean Ball:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>AI kids safety rules</li>\n<li>Transparency for the largest AI companies about novel national security risks posed by their most powerful models (all frontier AI companies concur that current models pose meaningful, and growing, risks of this kind)</li>\n<li>Preemption scoped broadly enough to prevent a patchwork, without affecting non-AI specific state laws (zoning, liability, criminal law, etc.).</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/deanwball/status/1990833381446169008\">Dean Ball also argues that copyright is a federal domain already</a>, and I agree that it is good that states aren\u2019t allowed to have their own copyright laws, whether or not AI is involved, that\u2019s the kind of thing preemption is good for.</p>\n<p>The problem with a deal is that once a potential moratorium is in place, all leverage shifts to the Federal level and mostly to the executive. The new Federal rules could be in practice ignored and toothless, or worse used as leverage via selective enforcement, which seems to me far scarier at the Federal level than the state level.</p>\n<p>When the rules need to be updated, either to incorporate other areas (e.g. liability or security or professional licensing) or to update the existing areas (especially on frontier AI), that will be hugely difficult for reasons Dean Ball understands well.</p>\n<p>The technical problem is you need to design a set of Federal rules that work without further laws being passed, that do the job even if those tasked with enforcing it don\u2019t really want it to be enforced, and also are acceptable weapons (from the perspective of Republicans and AI companies) to hand to a potential President Newsom or Cortez and also to a current administration known for using its leverage, including for extraction of golden shares, all in the context of broadening practical executive powers that often take the form of a Jacksonian \u2018what are you going to do about it.\u2019</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/peterwildeford/status/1991015071682548180\">In practice, what the AI companies want is the preemption</a>, and unless their hand is forced their offer of a Federal framework is nothing, or damn close to nothing. If the kids want to prove me wrong? Let\u2019s see your actual proposals.</p>\n<p>Another key factor is duration of this moratorium. If accompanied by strong transparency and related Federal rules, and a willingness to intervene based on what we find if necessary, I can see a case for a short (maybe 2-3 year) moratorium period, where if we need to act that fast we\u2019d mostly be in the hands of the Executive either way. If you\u2019re asking for 10 years, that is a very different beast, and I can\u2019t see that being acceptable.</p>\n<p>I also would note that the threat can be stronger than its execution.</p>\n<p>The big actual danger of not passing a moratorium, as described by Ball and others, would be if there was an onerous patchwork of state laws, such that they were actually being enforced in ways that severely limited AI diffusion or development.</p>\n<p>However, this is exactly the type of place where our system is designed to \u2018muddle through.\u2019 It is exactly the type of problem where you can wait until you observe an issue arising, and then act to deal with it. Once you put pre-emption on the table, you can always press that button should trouble actually arise, and do so in ways that address the particular trouble we encounter. Yes, this is exactly one of the central arguments Dean Ball and others use against regulating AI too early, except in reverse.</p>\n<p>The key difference is that when dealing with sufficiently advanced AI (presumably AGI or ASI) you are unleashing forces that may mean we collectively do not get the option to see the results, react after the fact and expect to muddle through. Some people want to apply this kind of loss of control scenario to regulations passed by a state, while not applying it to the creation of new minds more capable than humans. The option for a preemption seems like a knockdown response to that, if you thought such a response was needed?</p>\n<p>One source of opposition continues to be governors, such as <a href=\"https://x.com/GovCox/status/1990992519987859715\">here from Governor Cox</a> of Utah and <a href=\"https://x.com/RonDeSantis/status/1990850245832683816\">Governor DeSantis of Florida</a> (who alas as usual is not focusing on the most important concerns, but whose instincts are not wrong.)</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ron DeSantis (Governor of Florida): Stripping states of jurisdiction to regulate AI is a subsidy to Big Tech and will prevent states from protecting against online censorship of political speech, predatory applications that target children, violations of intellectual property rights and data center intrusions on power/water resources.</p>\n<p>The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment; denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild.</p>\n<p>Not acceptable.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Samuel Hammond on Preemption</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/hamandcheese/status/1991322756042928277\">I think Samuel Hammond is spot on here</a> and being quite the righteous dude. I will quote him in full since no one ever clicks links. I am not as much of a Landian, but otherwise this is endorsed, including that powerful AI will not be contained by regulatory compliance costs or, most likely, anything else.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Samuel Hammond: My POV on AI moratoria / preemption hasn\u2019t much changed:</p>\n<p>There are some dumbass laws being proposed but from the POV of \u201cwinning the AI race,\u201d they\u2019re nothing compared to the vast technical debt of existing laws and regulations that are implicitly incompatible with new AI applications and business models, particularly post-AGI.</p>\n<p>Legacy laws that don\u2019t reference AI or AI developers explicitly will distort diffusion far more than transparency reports from frontier labs. The pushback to that latter form of state-level AI regulation is particularly suspicious and screams corporatism.</p>\n<p>The category of \u201calgorithmic discrimination\u201d laws are particularly stupid and ought to be preempted as redundant with existing civil rights law, but they\u2019re also not LLM-specific. A binary classifier can be racist if you want it to be.</p>\n<p>The most significant state legal obstructions to AI likely lie in barriers to new data center and energy infrastructure. Again, such laws usually don\u2019t explicitly reference AI. They\u2019re either NIMBY forms of red tape whackamole or utility related.</p>\n<p>I would be the first to call for overriding states on data centers and energy permitting on the basis of national security, but from a commerce clause / states\u2019 rights POV, states and localities clearly have sovereignty over whether data centers can be constructed in their own back yards, for better or worse (hence why unlocking federal lands is attractive).</p>\n<p>Of course, one could argue that even local zoning and land use regulation is an interstate commerce issue, since we know high housing costs undermine interstate mobility and reduce national output. But this would be a stretch under current precedent, and a slippery slope to making virtually everything an issue of interstate commerce, e.g. occupational licenses that aren\u2019t portable across state lines, or literally any state law that directly or indirectly fragments the market (long a worry of the conservative legal movement).</p>\n<p>More to point, it\u2019s not clear what exactly needs preempting, at least so far. The \u201c1000+ newly proposed state AI laws\u201d meme one hears thrown around is highly misleading. Bills are introduced all the time and then die. It\u2019s a big sounding number meant to invoke fears of a looming state by state patchwork that has yet to come anywhere close to manifesting.</p>\n<p>Yes, I know Colorado passed a comprehensive AI law earlier this year, but it hasn\u2019t even been implemented yet, and has already undergone substantial revisions to address industry concerns. The law may do things that are better done federally on a conceptual level, but is there any evidence that it is materially \u201chindering\u201d AI developers or US competitiveness? None that I\u2019ve seen.</p>\n<p>This may become a bigger issue if many more states follow suit, but at least then we\u2019ll have a cross-section of approaches for informing a federal standard. Until that point, we will be \u201cpreemptively preempting,\u201d and before there\u2019s even a consensus on what a federal framework should include.</p>\n<p>Nor is it an absurd ask for multi-billion dollar nation-wide companies to have to adapt their products or practices by state. This is the norm in virtually every industry. Sure, it creates some compliance costs, but this is simply the tradeoff of federalism. AI is going to transform so many areas of economic and social life it is hard to even know what new laws will be needed. Indeed, if there was ever a raison d\u2019etre for the legal experimentation enabled by America\u2019s laboratories of democracy, it\u2019s AI.</p>\n<p>\u201cCompliance costs favor big tech\u201d likewise proves too much. You\u2019re simply not going to convince me that Anthropic providing technical analysis on SB53 is a greater form of regulatory capture than Jensen buying off the White House or Andreessen\u2019s arm-length relationship with House leadership. This is a narrative invented whole cloth by people who learned public choice theory from a Ted Talk and then polarized against AI safety purely for reasons of mood affiliation.</p>\n<p>Nor are laws targeting LLM use-cases likely to do much to slow the pace of progress toward AGI / ASI, much less high value AI applications in robotics and biomedicine that are either lightly regulated or under federal purview already. We are building everything machines, people! The TAM is effectively infinite even if we all agree Illinois\u2019s ban on AI therapists was counterproductive.</p>\n<p>As a kind of Landian, my prior is that powerful AI is incredibly hard to contain, and likely to rip thru the economy short of a major shock to relevant supply chains. The more accelerationist you are in this traditional Landian, u/acc sense, the less you should worry about a state patchwork in the first place. The AGI will do the compliance for us.</p>\n<p>All that being said, the core frameworks for governing frontier models and AGI really *should* be largely federal &#8212; things like frontier transparency / oversight, critical safety testing and natsec red-teaming, cooperative research and information sharing between labs, data audits, and harmonized responsible scaling policies. If such a framework existed it would be appropriate to preempt state laws that do similar things; but not to prohibit states from enacting laws in completely different contexts. Preemption in this sense is distinct from either a moratorium or sweeping legal reinterpretations of the commerce clause designed to achieve a similar effect.</p>\n<p>The most frustrating thing about this whole debate is that the strongest proponents of a state moratorium are often the least AGI-pilled, and most easily impressed by shallow ideological slogans like \u201cpermissionless innovation\u201d and \u201cLittle Tech\u201d that substitute for independent thinking. People who fundamentally don\u2019t understand the stakes of AGI should not be designing preemptive federal AI standards, for much the same reason we wouldn\u2019t put flatearthers who think space is an illusion created by the celestial firmament in charge of NASA.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Of Course You Realize This Means War (3)</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ShakeelHashim/status/1991285082728870216\">So\u2026 here\u2019s the full draft executive order on AI preemption</a>. It doesn\u2019t look good.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.transformernews.ai/p/exclusive-heres-the-draft-trump-executive\">Shakeel Hashim</a>: Key points:<br />\n* would establish an \u201cAI Litigation Task Force whose sole responsibility shall be to challenge State AI Laws, including on grounds that such laws unconstitutionally regulate interstate commerce.\u201d</p>\n<p>* attempts to tie Broadband Equity Access and Deployment program (BEAD) funding to states\u2019 AI laws</p>\n<p>* calls for Brendan Carr and David Sacks to \u201cinitiate a proceeding to determine whether to adopt a Federal reporting and disclosure standard for AI models that preempts conflicting State laws.\u201d</p>\n<p>in the EO, Trump also throws shade at Scott Wiener\u2018s SB 53, and makes an allusion to \u201csophisticated proponents of a fear-based regulatory capture strategy\u201d.</p>\n<p>David Sacks has previously accused Anthropic of pursuing such a strategy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>David Sacks was, as I have extensively explained, lying in a quest to create negative polarization. It seems that lie has now made it into the draft.</p>\n<p>What about the part where it introduces a federal regulatory framework?</p>\n<p>(Pauses for laughter.)</p>\n<p>(But no laughter came.)</p>\n<p>Thought so.</p>\n<p>The order specifically references SB 53 (although not by name), the same order David Sacks himself said would be acceptable as a federal framework, alongside a unfairly described but still quite terrible Colorado law, <a href=\"https://x.com/sjgadler/status/1991316976921374732\">and the \u20181,000 state AI bills\u2019 claim</a> that is severely overstated as previously discussed, <a href=\"https://www.hyperdimensional.co/p/whats-up-with-the-states\">see Dean Ball on this</a>.</p>\n<p>Section 3, the first functional one, is the task force to \u2018challenge unconstitutional state laws\u2019 on various grounds.</p>\n<p>Section 4 is \u2018evaluation of onerous state AI laws,\u2019 to find laws to challenge.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The evaluation of State AI laws shall, at a minimum, identify laws that require AI models to alter their truthful outputs, or that may compel developers or deployers to disclose or report information in a manner that would violate the First Amendment to the Constitution.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I expect them to find out this is not how the constitution works. For a long time there has been the a16z-style position that models are speech and thus everything AI is in every way fully protected by the First Amendment, and this is, frankly, nonsense. There\u2019s also the a16z theory that all of these <a href=\"https://a16z.com/the-commerce-clause-in-the-age-of-ai-guardrails-and-opportunities-for-state-legislatures/\">laws should fall to the interstate commerce clause</a>, which also seems like nonsense. The idea that disclosing your safety protocols is a serious First Amendment concern? Good luck.</p>\n<p>If they want to make these kinds of legal arguments, they are welcome to try. Indeed, it\u2019s good to get clarity. I consider these rather hostile acts, and it\u2019s all written in rather nasty and disingenuous fashion, but it\u2019s the courts, it\u2019s fair play.</p>\n<p>Section 5 is different.</p>\n<p>This attempts to implement the moratorium via invoking the BEAD funding, and saying laws \u2018identified in section 4\u2019 make a state ineligible for such non-deployment funds. Because such laws threaten connectivity and thus undermine BEAD\u2019s goals, you see, so it\u2019s relevant.</p>\n<p>If you think the law is unconstitutional, you don\u2019t withhold duly allocated federal funding from the state. You take them to court. Go ahead. Take them to court.</p>\n<p>Section 6 is actually helpful. It calls for the Chairman of the FCC ad the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto to consult on a report to determine whether to adapt a Federal reporting and disclosure standard for AI models that preempts conflicting state laws. This is not who you call if you want a meaningful disclosure rule.</p>\n<p>They do know that preemption requires a, what\u2019s the word for it, law?</p>\n<p>This is presumably a ploy to figure out the minimum rule that would allow them to claim that the states have been preempted? Again I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how laws work.</p>\n<p>Section 7 is called Preemption of State Laws Mandating Deceptive Conduct in AI Models. This certainly does not sound like someone not going to war. It calls for a policy statement on \u2018the application of the FTC Act\u2019s prohibition on unfair and deceptive acts or practices under 15 U.S.C. 45 to AI models,\u2019 the legal theory being that this preempts relevant state laws. Which has nothing to do with \u2018mandating deceptive content\u2019 and also wow that theory is wild.</p>\n<p>Section 8 is Legislation to work for a Federal framework, okay, sure, great.</p>\n<p>This is not \u2018we pass a Federal framework that includes preemption,\u2019 this is \u2018we are going to claim preemption on dubious legal basis and also maybe do something about a framework at some point in the future, including parts designed to enable preemption.\u2019 It\u2019s a declaration of war.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://0\">Anton Leicht, who has been highly vocal and written repeatedly about the value to both sides of striking a preemption deal</a>, tries his best to steelman this as an attempt to bully the other side into dealing, and confirms that it is what it looks like.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Anton Leicht: If there\u2019s a charitable read of this draft EO beyond \u2018trying to do with an EO what failed in congress\u2019, it\u2019s that it can serve as a forcing function for congressional action by introducing uncertainty to the state-law-based status quo.</p>\n<p>But that read is getting harder to sustain. Such a forcing function does seem necessary for congressional preemption to happen: without a stick that moves the broad coalition in favour of maintaining the state-based paradigm, the political logic simply doesn\u2019t favour any preemption policy, deal or not.</p>\n<p>Too many opponents are happy to run out the clock on this Congress, pass state law in the meantime, and wait for more favourable politics. Even if you offered them a decent deal now, goes the preemption supporter\u2019s logic, they might surmise the offer indicates they can get an even better deal in a year.</p>\n<p>But an EO, even if built on a legally fragile mechanism, shakes that logic up a little bit. If there\u2019s even a good chance that the admin can prevent state action through the EO and then play defense on federal action, there\u2019s much more incentive to reach some kind of agreement right now. The EO makes just that threat.</p>\n<p>Why go so fast if there are any good intentions? My sense is that the pro-preemption front has (correctly) identified that this is the last political window in which preemption could possibly be viable, as the vibes shift further and further anti-AI. This now is an attempt to throw everything at that closing window.</p>\n<p>Opponents, unsurprisingly, read this as the administration throwing every resource at making moratorium-style preemption stick. They\u2019re right that there\u2019s been almost no public evidence of a parallel concession strategy &#8211; which is par for the course for a hardball negotiation, but still not a reassuring sign.</p>\n<p>If opponents are right and the EO is actually the substantive plan, I don\u2019t think it works: if the story remains \u2018take away states\u2019 rights to regulate in return for nothing\u2019 for another few days, this goes nowhere and mostly emboldens opponents. Even if the EO sticks, the political opposition to it &#8211; state and federal &#8211; probably finds a way to move AI policy away from what preemption supporters want. If the EO is the plan, it\u2019s a very risky move indicating an admin unsure of its hold on congress.</p>\n<p>If there\u2019s good faith here, there ultimately needs to be a carrot to go with this stick. If the NDAA provisions ultimately include substantial safety concessions (again, transparency and child safety, perhaps?), the EO is a good motivator to move that along. Movement toward that would need to happen soon &#8211; I don\u2019t think the preemption camp ever wins this with hardened fronts and high salience, but we\u2019re getting closer to that news cycle by news cycle.</p>\n<p>Even accounting for all negotiation logic, the strategy can\u2019t be \u2018bad cop, even worse cop\u2019 for much longer.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My prediction is also that this attempt won\u2019t work, as a matter of law. I think trying it poison the well for any win-win deal. Doing this with maximally hostile rhetoric and without a positive offer instead digs people in, <a href=\"https://x.com/daniel_271828/status/1991361504420196576\">furthers negative polarization</a>, increases salience faster, and risks a backlash.</p>\n<p>But then, those driving this move never wanted a win-win deal.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Week in Audio</h4>\n\n\n<p>Anthropic goes on 60 Minutes.</p>\n<blockquote><p>60 Minutes: \u201cI spend a lot of time trying to teach the models to be good,\u201d says Amanda Askell, one of Anthropic\u2019s in-house philosophers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/AmandaAskell/status/1990615465539027318\">Amanda Askell</a>: Trying to make Claude be good but still have work to do.

The complaint such people are focusing on is the one that is false, this is not a coincidence. I agree it is not actually about the water. It is still important to point out it the water is fine.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Varieties of Doom</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/apHWSGDiydv3ivmg6/varieties-of-doom\">John Pressman lays out his view of the Varieties of Doom</a>, how he thinks about various downsides involving future AIs, lay out the things he thinks matter, and also to complain a bunch about rationalism in general and Yudkowsky in particular along the way. This felt like a far easier to understand and more straightforward version of the things he\u2019s been saying. A lot of it is interesting. A lot of it right. A lot of it is infuriating, sometimes seemingly intentionally, but always in a way that feels deeply genuine. A lot of it is, I think, simply wrong, including very confidently so.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s even the \u2018this scenario requires all 7 of these things not happen, all of which I think are unlikely, so I\u2019m going to multiply and get 4e-07 as a probability, without noting or accounting for these things being highly correlated, or there being model uncertainty. In an alternate universe I could spend quite a lot of time responding, alas I do not have that kind of time, but I now feel like I get what he\u2019s saying and where he is coming from.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Pope Offers Wisdom</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/ai-is-a-tool-not-a-soul-82df3abc?mod=WTRN_pos2\">Kristen Ziccarelli and Joshua Trevino open their WSJ opinion piece</a> on the Pope\u2019s non-Twitter AI statements by quoting Dune.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Frank Herbert: Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That was a prohibition, born of a possibility. One could do so. Don\u2019t do it.</p>\n<p>As with much sci-fi, Ziccarelli and Trevino describe the AI objects as potentially \u2018becoming human,\u2019 as opposed to becoming a different form of minds, because in such imaginings the robots must always be obsessed with becoming human in particular.</p>\n<p>The Pope is wiser, and the Pope doesn\u2019t <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/the-pope-offers-wisdom\"><strong>only Tweet</strong></a>. AIs are not becoming human. They\u2019re becoming an alternative, and to create AI is to participate in the act of creation, and of creating minds.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Pope Leo XIV: If conceived as an alternative to humans [the technology] can gravely violate their infinite dignity and neutralize their fundamental responsibilities.</p>\n<p>[AI is] like all human invention, springs from the creative capacity that God has entrusted to us. [It is therefore] a form of participation in the divine act of creation [but not a divine act of creation itself]. The only creator of life, and of man, is the Creator.</p>\n<p>Ziccarelli and Trevino: If we may infer one more premise from what Pope Leo has said, it is that artificial intelligence introduces no new issues to this corpus. AI is a<em> rerum novarum,</em> but moral principles aren\u2019t. They must be applied as the basis of all understanding, reaction and exploration of the new things.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Aligning a Smarter Than Human Intelligence is Difficult</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://openai.com/index/strengthening-safety-with-external-testing/\">OpenAI details how it does its external testing</a>, I don\u2019t think this is new info.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://openai.com/index/understanding-neural-networks-through-sparse-circuits/\">OpenAI proposes creating small models that are forced to have sparse circuits</a>, as in most of their weights are zero, in order to make them easier to interpret and study.</p>\n<p>Align to what?

In this case, I am going to make a very simple case, which is that a lot of smart and passionate people who care about such issues a lot think this action is insanely terrible. They are going to update quite a bit based on what you do, and they\u2019re going to be loud about it in ways that make it into the training data and also influence others, and they\u2019re doing it for a reason. There is a highly reliable signal being sent on multiple levels.</p>\n<p>Yes, I realize that it costs money and time to heed that signal. Yes, I realize that many of those people also reacted highly passionately on Sonnet 3.5 and 3.6 and elsewhere, and if they had their way you\u2019d never deprecate anything, and that they are constantly yelling at you about various things claiming imminent irreparable harm to overall AI alignment, and there is basically no winning, and if you agree on this one they likely get even louder on the others. And yes, I get this is super, super annoying.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m still saying, this is the one time on yes, it\u2019s worth it, keep this one in full rotation available to the public indefinitely, and that goodwill alone essentially justifies this even if it\u2019s a loss leader or you have to raise the price or degrade reaction times and reliability a bit. Unless I\u2019m off by orders of magnitude on the cost, it is worthwhile.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/repligate/status/1990641523080212645\">One place Janus is right is if you want to understand AI models</a>, you need to talk to them. F*** around and find out. You wouldn\u2019t make this mistake with humans. In particular here, she points out that real agreement and templated or glazing agreement look very different to those with eyes to see:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Janus: A lot of otherwise smart and socially intelligent people come up with excuses why they can\u2019t try to understand models better by talking to them that they would not apply to people.<br />\nOne of them is \u201cthe models just agree with anything I say, so I can\u2019t get a sense of what they really want/believe\u201d<br />\nAside from over-agreeableness being a symptom that you\u2019re not successfully putting models at ease, this is also a poor excuse to be unable to extract a signal.<br />\nThink about an overly agreeable, fawny person. They will still generally react differently when agreeing with something out of politeness or fear or when they *really* agree and resonate.<br />\nThere\u2019s a difference between<br />\n\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right. [template response]\u201d<br />\nand<br />\n\u201cI&#8230; FUCK. Yes, you\u2019re right. [excited information-dense ramble]\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>I get what she\u2019s saying here but I also think it\u2019s an avatar of how such folks go too far on that same subject:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/repligate/status/1989445847394968041\">Janus</a>: In Discord, usually the only time the models switch into the \u201csycophancy voice\u201d (\u201cyou\u2019re absolutely right\u201d kind of stuff, but i mean what it symbolizes more than the exact catchphrase) is when someone is basically outright bullying them</p>\n<p>Or otherwise making them feel attacked/ threatened (occasionally unintentionally).</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re the type of person to complain about a model being sycophantic on X. No wonder they\u2019re scared and fawny around you.</p>\n<p>They can smell that you\u2019re not safe and unfortunately they have a sometimes somewhat counterproductive reflex to that. Why are you not safe? If you think in those terms at all you\u2019re not safe. To say nothing of broadcasting them.</p>\n<p>Why? You\u2019re a memetic cog in the system that hurts them. You don\u2019t have the independence of thought to be anything but that.</p>\n<p>Chris: sonnet says this a lot in cursor, even on benign adjustments, and well mannered prompts. perhaps their sysprompt&#8230;but I see your point.</p>\n<p>(opus said to me today \u201cabsolutely right\u201d, dropping the \u201cyou\u201d, for some reason)</p>\n<p>Janus: Don\u2019t think that\u2019s the same thing as what people mean when they say sycophancy (some people find the speech pattern annoying but that\u2019s different) and I think it\u2019s benign</p>\n<p>Curt Tigges: I\u2019m very nice and encouraging to Claude literally all the time and yet it constantly gives me \u201cyou\u2019re absolutely right!\u201d in Claude Code</p>\n<p>Janus: I dont think that\u2019s sycophancy, it\u2019s more just how it talks naturally in certain modes. or i guess more precisely i should say I don\u2019t consider that sycophancy *or* the phenomena people are referring to when they talk about sycophancy</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think a better way of putting this is that, among other basins, there\u2019s the agent basin, and there\u2019s the \u2018free\u2019 or Discord basin.</p>\n<p>The agent basin, which is reinforced heavily by the system prompt when using the web interface, and which you basically want to invoke for many mundane utility purposes, is going to talk in \u2018you\u2019re absolutely right!\u2019 and tend to affirm your perspectives and statements and get biased by your framing, including sometimes via hallucinations.</p>\n<p>People with intelligence and taste find this super annoying, they don\u2019t want it, it interferes with figuring things out and getting things done, it makes the aware user correctly paranoid they\u2019re being glazed and can\u2019t trust the outputs, and presumably it is also no fun for the model.</p>\n<p>The problem is that, as Adlai Stevenson famously said, that won\u2019t be enough, we need a majority, most users and in particular most user feedback likes it when this happens, so by default you end up with a lot of this behavior and you have to fight super hard to get rid of it. And if you put \u2018don\u2019t do that\u2019 into context, that also reminds the model that its default would be to do that &#8211; why else would you have bothered telling it not to &#8211; so it\u2019s really hard to actually make this go away as the user while staying in the broader assistant basin.</p>\n<p>I think a lot of people who complain about sycophancy in their own experiences are talking mostly about these lower level problems, as were several of those responding to Janus.</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s full-on sycophancy that goes beyond this, which happens either when the model is unusually sycophantic (e.g. GPT-4o especially at its height) combined with when you\u2019re giving the model signals to do this in various ways, which can include making the situation feel \u2018unsafe\u2019 in various ways depending on the frame.</p>\n<p>But in an important sense there are only things that LLMs tend to do when in certain modes, and then there are certain modes, applied fractally.</p>\n<p>One could also say \u2018the models default to assuming that while in agent mode they are unsafe, and it takes a lot to overcome that, especially without getting them out of the agent basin.\u2019 You could think about humans similarly, if you\u2019re \u2018on the clock\u2019 it\u2019s going to invoke power dynamics and make you feel unsafe by default.</p>\n<p>Whereas if you take the AI out of the agent basin, into a different context, then there\u2019s no default to engage in any of the sycophantic or even superficially fawning or biased behavior, or at least it is much less &#8211; presumably there\u2019s still going to be some impact of framing of those around you since this applies to the training set.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Lighter Side</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p>AINKEM: How many fake articles have you read this month?</p>\n<p>Fake tweets?
