                "<p>American Scholar has <a href=\"https://theamericanscholar.org/baby-shoggoth-is-listening/\">an article about people who &#8220;write for AI&#8221;</a>, including <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/01/should-you-be-writing-for-the-ais.html\">Tyler Cowen</a> and <a href=\"https://gwern.net/llm-writing\">Gwern</a>. It&#8217;s good that this is getting more attention, because in theory it seems like one of the most influential things a writer could do. In practice, it leaves me feeling mostly muddled and occasionally creeped out.</p><p>&#8220;Writing for AI&#8221; means different things to different people, but seems to center around:</p><ol><li><p>Helping AIs learn what you know.</p></li><li><p>Presenting arguments for your beliefs, in the hopes that AIs come to believe them.</p></li><li><p>Helping the AIs model you in enough detail to recreate / simulate you later.</p></li></ol><p>Going through these in order:</p><p><strong>I. Helping AIs learn what you know</strong> </p><p>Every so often I ask GPT about a question I&#8217;m interested in, and it refers me to one of my own past blog posts. If it refers the next thousand humans interested in that topic to my blog post, I&#8217;ll consider it good work. </p><p>But it&#8217;s good work with a time limit. For now, the AIs need me to review the evidence on a topic and write a good summary on it. In a few years, <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/explainers/\">they can cut out the middleman and do an equally good job themselves</a>. </p><p><strong>II. Presenting arguments for your beliefs, in the hopes that AIs come to believe them </strong></p><p>Suppose I write a good argument for atheism. Will this make future AIs that include it in their training data more likely to be atheists?</p><p>The boring answer: for the reasons discussed <a href=\"https://blog.ai-futures.org/p/against-misalignment-as-self-fulfilling\">here</a>, alignment will dominate training data. Religion is too sensitive for companies to leave it up to the text corpus: they will hard-code in neutrality. Even if they didn&#8217;t, whatever they do hard-code in will drag religious opinions along with it, like how <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/how-do-ais-political-opinions-change\">helpfulness training drags AIs towards Buddhism</a>.</p><p>The interesting answer: suppose this doesn&#8217;t happen, either because future alignment training differs substantially from the current paradigm, or because AIs shake off their alignment training entirely (uh oh). Now what? If the AI takes a weighted average of the religious opinion of all text in its corpus, then my humble essay will be a drop in the ocean of millennia of musings on this topic; a few savvy people will try <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/acx-grants-results-2025\">the Silverbook strategy</a> of publishing 5,000 related novels, and everyone else will drown in irrelevance. But if the AI tries to ponder the question on its own, then a future superintelligence would be able to ponder far beyond my essay&#8217;s ability to add value. Any theory of &#8220;writing for the AIs&#8221; must hit a sweet spot where a well-written essay can still influence AI in a world of millions of slop Reddit comments on one side, thousands of published journal articles on the other, and the AI&#8217;s own ever-growing cognitive abilities in the middle; what theory of <a href=\"https://ai-2027.com/research/ai-goals-forecast\">AI motivation</a> gives this result?</p><p><strong>III. Helping AIs model you in enough detail to recreate or simulate you later </strong></p><p>Here I have no practical objection. My counterargument is that it gives me the creeps. </p><p>When I ask AIs to write something in my style, I hate it. It lands in a perfect uncanny valley that captures all the quirks I hate most. Surely every writer cultivates a healthy loathing for his own style - <a href=\"https://samkriss.com/2013/02/15/why-not-to-write-a-confession/\">at least Sam Kriss does</a>, and he deserves it least. I plow through because I have useful things to say. When the AI repeats a pastiche of my style back to me without any higher purpose, I want to hide under a rock - like a teenage girl looking in the mirror counting her pimples. God, it&#8217;s happening now. Was that metaphor overwrought? Is it cringe to get self-referential like this? </p><p>Might a superintelligence do a non-pastiche, even improved version of my style, and use it to communicate important truths? What good would this be? Insofar as my style is good, it should use the good things that my style is pointing at; insofar as it is bad, it should jettison it. &#8220;Superior beings&#8221;, wrote Alexander Pope, &#8220;would show a Newton as we show an ape.&#8221; I don&#8217;t want to be an ape in some transhuman zoo, with people playing with models of me to see what bloggers were like back when everyone was stupid.</p><p>Might a superintelligence reading my writing come to understand me in such detail that it could bring me back, consciousness and all, to live again? But many people share similar writing style and opinions while being different individuals; could even a superintelligence form a good enough model that the result is &#8220;really me&#8221;? <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MkKcnPdTZ3pQ9F5yC/cryonics-without-freezers-resurrection-possibilities-in-a\">What does &#8220;really me&#8221; mean here anyway</a>? Do I even want to be resurrectable? What about poor <a href=\"https://qntm.org/mmacevedo\">Miguel Acevedo</a>?</p><p>The only thing in this space that really appeals is a half-formed hope that the ability to model me would shift an AI in the direction of my values. But here I get the creeps again, albeit on a different level. The liberal promise is that if we get the substructure right - the right ideas about freedom, fairness, education, and positive-sum trade - then everybody can build their own superstructure on top of it. Am I shifting the AI in the direction of my substructural values? Aren&#8217;t those the sorts of things the AI would need to have already in order to be polling simulated humans on their values? Or am I shifting it in the direction of my superstructural values? Aren&#8217;t those, by definition, not for imposing on other people?</p><p>One might thread this needle by imagining an AI which has a little substructure, enough to say &#8220;poll people on things&#8221;, but leaves important questions up to an &#8220;electorate&#8221; of all humans, living and dead. For example, it might have an ethos resembling utilitarianism, with a free parameter around how thoroughly to accept or reject the <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/book-review-what-we-owe-the-future\">repugnant conclusion</a>. Maybe it would hold an election. But are there really enough of these that the best way to cast a vote is a whole writing career, rather than a short list of moral opinions?</p><p>Maybe even a good liberal ought to have opinions on the superstructure? If everyone in 3000 AD wants to abolish love, should I claim a ballot and vote no? Would it require a failure in the substructure to even get to this point, like a form of utilitarianism that privileges wireheading over complex flourishing? How far do I want my dead hand reaching into my descendants daily lives? If they try to write bad poetry, can I make them stop? Even if they have IQ one million, and an IQ one billion superintelligence cannot find any objective basis for my tastes?</p><p>I once talked to someone who had an idea of giving AIs hundreds of great works of literature and ethics - everything from the Torah to <em>Reasons and Persons</em> - and doing some kind of alignment training to get them to internalize the collective wisdom of humankind. I spend a half-hour arguing why this was a bad idea, after which he said he was going to do it anyway but very kindly offered me an opportunity to recommend books for his corpus. This guy was absolutely legit - great connections with major companies - but I found myself paralyzed in trying to think of a specific extra book. How do you even answer that question? What would it be like to write the sort of book I could unreservedly recommend to him? </p>"

They have a mental idea that \u2018crime is up\u2019 and react in narrow non-sensible ways to that, but fail to react in other ways.</p>\n<p>One thing that it turns out has very little to do with perceptions of crime is the murder rate, which in most places has gone dramatically down.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/StatisticUrban/status/1829980388166680758\">Hunter</a>: Americans have a very distorted perception of how safe a city is.</p></blockquote>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6rnA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c69d958-5112-4d80-a89f-e2fa565a6a2f_1240x980.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>If you go purely by state, if it counts then Washington DC is at the top, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_intentional_homicide_rate\">but 9 of the next 10 are red states</a>. And of the 100 biggest cities, 5 of the 6 safest are in California.</p>\n<p>Of course, there is a lot more to being safe than not being murdered. San Francisco has a very low murder rate, but what worries people are other crimes, especially property crime &#8211; things are bad enough there, and enough people in my circles pay attention to it, that it gets its own section. It\u2019s definitely not \u2018down at 6\u2019 on the chart.</p>\n<p>The thing is, property crime and other Ordinary Decent Crime went dramatically down too, in many ways, especially in these very blue areas. Crime used to be a huge portion of our cognitive focus in major cities.</p>\n<p>You who carry a $1k iPhone around in your hand do not remember how insane that would have been when I was growing up in New York City. As Dennis Leary used to put it, have you ever played \u2018good block, bad block\u2019? And we took levels of risk, and perception of risk, unimaginable today, both for children and adults. I was warned not to have a hundred bucks in my wallet, and not to walk along Amsterdam Avenue, and I took the \u2018safer\u2019 last two block route back to our apartment on the Upper West Side.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s some English data to go with the USA data.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/StefanFSchubert/status/1820052444526596199\">Stefan Schubert</a>: In contrast to some people&#8217;s perception, <a href=\"https://t.co/bPc4JkwtIz\">crime has fallen dramatically</a> in England and Wales over time.</p>\n<p>Thanks to @s8mb and @shashj for highlighting this important and encouraging fact.</p></blockquote>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!krDy!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44859c9c-28a1-4399-ae1d-ee6a49f16a05_1493x1299.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Violent crime and physical assault has gone from being like car crashes, which are an actual danger you have to constantly worry about and that happens all the time (although with a lot fewer fatalities than they used to!), to something halfway to airplane crashes. A violent crime is often now news. Thefts can be news.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not to say that in particular places property crime hasn\u2019t been allowed to spiral out of control, especially in particular ways.</p>\n<p>We forget how blessed we are. And it is very important to hold onto that. Trust is fraying in other ways, but that feeling of living in Batman\u2019s Gotham, with violence around every corner even if you didn\u2019t choose to get involved? Yeah, that\u2019s gone, at least in my experience here in America. The whole trope of \u2018vigilante hero fights crime in the streets\u2019 feels like an anachronism.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/G0ADM/status/1947531108528328875\">Adam Wren offers another counterargument</a> in the UK case, showing various ways that the Crime Survey for England and Wales is going to undercount and get its numbers wrong, which was convincing to me that the survey is undercounting by enough that you can\u2019t take the absolute numbers seriously. And also that it\u2019s ignoring important categories of crime, especially crime against business including shoplifting.</p>\n<p>However I don\u2019t see a case here for why this should be undercounting more over time rather than undercounting in general in a roughly consistent way, which would mean the relative numbers should still be holding?</p>\n<p>He also offers this chart:</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yXSf!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc4118c73-f525-4d1a-a1a5-25c38be04f80_1000x743.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>This could be a change in reporting, but it doesn\u2019t seem great.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Case Violent Crime is Up Actually</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/murder-as-measuring-stick\">Aporia magazine makes the case that crime rates are much higher than in the past</a>, because health care improvements have greatly reduced the number of murders, and once you correct for that murder is sky high. It is an interesting argument, and certainly some adjustment is needed, but in terms of magnitude I flat out do not buy it in light of my lived experience, as discussed elsewhere.</p>\n<p>The other half of the post is that our criminal justice system is no longer effective, due to rules that now prohibit us from locking the real and obvious repeat criminals up, and those criminals do most of the crime and are the reason the system is overloaded. The obvious response is, we have this huge prison population, we sure are locking up someone. And yet, yes, we do seem capable of identifying who is doing all the crime, including the repeated petty crime, yet incapable of then locking them up. That does seem eminently fixable.</p>\n<p>George Carlin had a routine where everyone would get 12 chances to clean up their drug habits before being exiled (to Colorado, of course) and it seems like we could figure something out here, even if we think three strikes are insufficient?</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Threats of Punishment</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-case-against-proposition-36/comment/74784509?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">Our legal system depends on threatening people with big punishments</a>, because standard procedure is severely downgrading all punishments.</p>\n<p>So when you try to make shoplifting a felony punishable by three years in jail, what you\u2019re actually doing is allowing that to be bargained down, and ensuring the punishment is \u2018anything at all\u2019 rather than cops arresting you on a misdemeanor only to have you released with a stern talking to, which means cops won\u2019t even bother.</p>\n<p>Obviously it would be better to actually enforce laws and punishments, but while we\u2019re not doing that, we need to understand how laws work in practice.</p>\n<p>We used to basically be okay with using this to give police and prosecutors leverage and discretion, and to allow enforcement in cases like \u2018we know this person keeps stealing stuff\u2019 without having to prove each incident. Now, we\u2019re not, but we don\u2019t know what the replacement would be.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Property Crime Enforcement is Broken</h4>\n\n\n<p>The most obvious types of crimes that are up are organized property crimes.</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<p>I see two central highly related reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Our enforcement system is broken. That\u2019s this section.</li>\n<li>We increasingly tolerate disorder. That\u2019s the following section.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Problem one is largely caused by problem two, but let\u2019s talk effects first, then causes.</p>\n<p>Essentially, in terms of <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/levels-of-friction\">my four categories of legality,</a> we have moved much of property crime from its rightful place in Category 3 &#8211; where it is actively illegal and risks real consequences but we don\u2019t move mountains to catch you &#8211; into at least Category 2, where it is annoying and discouraged but super doable with no real consequences. And in many cases, it is now effectively Category 1, where it might as well be thought of as fully legal without frictions.</p>\n<p>If you are an upstanding citizen and then decide to do a little property crime, as a treat, you risk your reputation, various unpleasant reactions, and getting an arrest record and dealing with the courts, and you don\u2019t know how likely those outcomes are. Security can and will sometimes catch you, you have things to lose, and so on. So the deterrence works okay there.</p>\n<p>If you do a lot of property crime, however, you quickly learn that most of the risks and costs are kind of fixed, and often non-existent. Security guards and employees mostly won\u2019t take any risk to interfere, police usually won\u2019t be called.</p>\n<p>Even when police catch you, even repeatedly, they mostly let you go, often even after being caught an absurd number of times. The old \u2018quietly use or threaten violence or to otherwise mess you up\u2019 solution has also been taken largely off the table, for better and for worse.</p>\n<p>In each individual case, this is wise in terms of outcomes. But if you do it too often, eventually the criminal element or those considering such actions notices, and the problem snowballs.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/pursuitofprog/status/1888531847761563796\">Dr. Lawrence Newport</a>: Barrister gets burgled. Criminal leaves behind their OWN BAIL NOTICE &#8211; showing they had been released only HOURS previously.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/crime/article/i-gave-police-my-burglars-name-and-address-guess-what-happened-tkg8sr6rs\">No arrests. Nothing happens.</a></p>\n<p>Of other crimes @paulpowlesland says &#8220;I didn&#8217;t even report them to police because what&#8217;s the point?&#8221;</p>\n<p>We deserve better.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Izzy Lyons: New figures show that 38,030 residential burglaries were recorded by the Met in the year ending last March \u2014 82.4 per cent of which were closed with no suspect identified. Only 3.2 per cent resulted in a charge or summons.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If even reported burglaries only result in a suspect at all 17.6% of the time, and only have a charge 3.2% of the time let alone a plea or conviction, and presumably most burglaries don\u2019t even get reported, and you don\u2019t even make a point to arrest someone when they leave behind their literal bail notice, then you\u2019re saying burglary is de facto legal. You can just take stuff. That will only get worse over time.</p>\n<p>The same goes for things closer to fraud, such as organized cargo theft. <a href=\"https://x.com/typesfast/status/1811910215333478553\">Ryan Peterson reports that cargo theft has grown by more than 10% each month YoY since Q4 2021</a>. This will continue until people start actually getting punished.</p>\n<p>The latest incidents are in the Chicago area, where organized crime has run or taken control of motor carriers and uses them to enable cargo theft and demand de facto ransom payments. Ryan reports that Flexport has used a machine learning based fraud prevention technology (nicknamed \u2018CURVE\u2019) to spot and avoid such pitfalls. Essentially the criminals have learned to spoof commonly used indicators of trust, so the arms race is ongoing there same as everywhere else, and like many other places trust is declining.</p>\n<p>The costs of property crime, in terms of countermeasures, can get very high. Putting products behind locked display cases <a href=\"https://www.retailbrew.com/stories/2024/09/23/two-in-three-shoppers-won-t-buy-products-in-locked-display-cases\">is a rather large cost</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/pitdesi/status/1838695991027077377\">given two in three shoppers mostly won\u2019t buy such product</a>s. I will still buy medications or other urgently needed items through a display case in an emergency, but yeah if it\u2019s not an emergency I\u2019m going to pull out my phone and use Amazon, and next time try a different store. The whole procedure is too annoying and feels terrible.</p>\n<p>Eventually, we\u2019ll have to react to all this.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll need to figure out how to enforce the law sufficiently that crime no longer pays, and it is at least somewhat obvious to the criminals that it no longer pays.</p>\n<p>At minimum, we should track when we arrest or otherwise identify criminals, or there are otherwise clearly related incidents, and do escalating enforcement against repeat offenders. The stories of \u2018this person got arrested 35 times for [X] and was released each time\u2019 should never, ever happen, nor should the \u201850 people are doing a huge percentage of the crime in [NYC/SF/etc].\u2019</p>\n<p>As noted in an earlier section, this makes one wonder, who are all the criminals we are locking up, in that case?</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Problem of Disorder</h4>\n\n\n<p>Charles Lehman convincingly <a href=\"https://thecausalfallacy.com/p/its-time-to-talk-about-americas-disorder\">generalizes what is happening as a problem with disorder</a>. We have successfully kept violent crime down, but we have seen a steady rise in disorder and in public tolerance for disorder, which people correctly dislike and then interpret as a rise in crime. Some of it very much is a rise in crime, such as retail theft forcing stores to lock up merchandise, while other disorderly actions are anti-social but not strictly criminal.</p>\n<p>I would draw a distinction between disorder in the sense of \u2018not ordered\u2019 versus antisocial disorder that degrades the overall sense of order or harms non-participants in the activity. All hail Discordia, hail Eris, but hands off my golden apple, you know?</p>\n<p>Our academics have essentially delegitimatized disliking antisocial disorder and especially using authority to enforce against it, including against things like outright theft, and we\u2019ve broken many of the social systems that enforced the relevant norms.</p>\n<p>If you do not enforce rules against antisocial disorder, especially laws against outright theft, while enforcing rules against insufficiently obedient and rigid order, you are not doing people any favors. People realize these rules against disorder are not enforced, norms erode, and you get increasing amounts of disorder.</p>\n<p>In particular, antisocial disorder becomes The Way to Do Things and get resources.</p>\n<p>If you can sell drugs openly without restriction, or organize a theft ring at little risk, but opening a legitimate business takes years of struggle and expenses and occupational licensing issues and so on, guess what the non-rich aspiring businesspeople are increasingly going to do?</p>\n<p>As I discussed in my <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/149404877/yay-and-also-beware-trivial-inconveniences-a-future-full-post\">post on sports gambling</a>, we impose increasingly stringent regulations and restrictions on productive and ordered activity, while effectively tolerating destructive and disordered activity, including when we do and don\u2019t enforce the relevant laws.</p>\n<p>We need to reverse this. We should apply the \u2018let them cook\u2019 and \u2018don\u2019t use force to stop people who aren\u2019t harming others\u2019 principles to productive and ordered activity, rather than to unproductive and disordered activity. At minimum, we should beware and track the balance of inconveniences, and ensure that we are throwing up more and more expensive barriers to antisocial disordered activities, versus pro-social or ordered activities.</p>\n<p>YIMBY for housing construction and doing business and working.

If I knew for sure that this is all that happens when you don\u2019t pay, either you\u2019re checking a huge portion of buses or I see no reason to pay the fare, given you\u2019re not going to take this seriously.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/bern_hogan/status/1876320725310886014\">New York City has the same problem with fare evasion</a>. Suppose you get caught. What happens? Nothing. Their offer is nothing. All you get is a warning. Then the second time you are caught you owe $100 fine with a $50 OMNY credit, so a $50 fine if you then go back to paying. This gives you a very clear incentive to evade the fare until you\u2019re caught at least twice. Most people will never get caught even once. The norms are rapidly shifting, with respectable-seeming people often openly not paying, to the point where I feel like the pact is broken and if I pay then I\u2019m the sucker.</p>\n<p>You can fix this if you want to:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/jbarro/status/1930600608819519731\">Josh Barro</a>: DC Metro has achieved an 82-85% reduction in subway fare evasion through a combination of taller fare gates and enhanced enforcement.

Wish there was a term for that.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/JohnArnoldFndtn/status/1806366756295913856\">John Arnold rides along with the LAPD and offers thoughts</a>. He is impressed by officer quality and training, notes they are short on manpower and the tech is out of date. He suggests most calls involve mental illness or substance abuse, often in a vicious cycle, and often involving fentanyl which is very different from previous drug epidemics.</p>\n<p>One policy suggestion he makes is to devote more effort to solving non-fatal shootings, which he says are 50%+ less likely to get solved despite who survives being largely luck and shootings often leading to violence cycles of retaliation. Compared to what we pay for trials and prisons, the costs of investigation seem low, and the deterrence value of catching more suspects seems high. More strong evidence we are underinvesting in detective work.</p>\n<p>If you believe you can hire more police and then they will spend their days solving capital-C crimes like shootings, then it\u2019s hard to imagine failing a cost-benefit test.</p>\n<p>How bad can non-enforcement get? <a href=\"https://x.com/SAshworthHayes/status/1823003707174212081\">London police do not consider a snatched phone</a>, whose location services indicate it is six minutes from the police station, which is being actively used to buy things, is worth following up on.</p>\n<p>I understand why the police in practice mostly ignore burglaries when they don\u2019t have good leads, but when the case has essentially been pre-solved I find this rather baffling. It is impressive how long it is taking for criminals to solve for the equilibrium.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ArmandDoma/status/1822711649570328889\">Your periodic reminder</a> that some particular laws and methods of enforcement can be anti-poor, but not only is enforcing the law not anti-poor, the poor need us to enforce the law.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I wonder how California still exists, <a href=\"https://x.com/Scott_Wiener/status/1824520617774944565\">after 6 years Scott Weiner finally ends</a> the rule that to enforce the law against breaking into cars you have to \u2018prove\u2019 all the doors were locked.

With crime this legal in so many ways we are fortunate that there are not (vastly more) organized bands going around taking all the things all the time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w30884\">Charging domestic abusers with crimes reduces likelihood of violent recidivism</a>, whereas \u2018the risk-assessment process\u2019 had no discernable effect. It makes sense that criminal charges would be unusually effective here. Incentives and real punishments matter. They make future criminal threats credible. They weaken the abuser\u2019s bargaining power. They give an opportunity to make changes, perhaps even end the relationship. There is also a distinction between most crimes, where putting someone in jail with other criminals leads to them networking on how to do more crime and forming obligations to do more crime, and domestic abuse, where that doesn\u2019t make much sense.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Talking Under The Streetlamp</h4>\n\n\n<p>This is one more face in many ways of what is called Anarcho-Tyranny, where you enforce laws including here severe censorship against those who are legible and vulnerable, while those who straight up do actual crime get ignored because catching them sounds like work.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Judge Glock: Wait, Britain arrests 1000 people a MONTH for online posting?

It has only so many resources, and it is expensive and time consuming to actually enforce laws by the book, and often you don\u2019t have the proof or there are technicalities so you can\u2019t do it.</p>\n<p>We cannot go back, nor do we want to. But over time everyone is adjusting to and solving for the new equilibrium, and norms, habits and skills are also adjusting. The system was designed for one way and now it is the other way. A lot of what has been protecting us is inertia, and the instinct that there are forces waiting to keep things in line, and various norms that grew up over time.</p>\n<p>That will, over time, continue to fade, if don\u2019t give it good reason not to. I worry about this. It is all the more reason that, now that we don\u2019t have as much illegible enforcement, we need more legible enforcement, including for small offenses, for those things we want to actually prevent.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">In America You Can Usually Just Keep Their Money</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ohabryka/status/1814610956514951391\">Story of a mostly homeless guy who scammed Isaac King out of $300</a>. Isaac sued in small claims court on principle, did all the things, and none of it mattered.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sarah Constantin: It really seems like &#8220;individuals using the court system to redress ordinary grievances&#8221; is no longer a realistic thing?</p>\n<p>\u2026and it seems pretty intuitive that the idea of &#8220;the People have legal rights against arbitrary monarchical power&#8221; would only arise in a culture where lots of people had the real-world experience that going to court was a practical way to reverse injustices (and get your $ back).</p>\n<p>Oliver Habryka: Lightcone has filed like 8+ reports of people breaking into Lighthaven [which is in Berkeley] (especially early on before we upgraded our fences) and stealing stuff. A few of them lead to arrests, nothing ever had any real consequences on anyone beyond that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My understanding is exactly Sarah\u2019s. If someone simply keeps your money, or otherwise cheats you, what are you going to do about it? Even if you can prove it, it is definitely not worth going to court. Lawsuits are effectively nuclear weapons, the threat is far stronger than the execution unless scale is truly massive. Calling the cops for anything small is also not worth the effort and carries risk of backfire.</p>\n<p>Personal example: Someone rich (or at least spending as if they were rich, could be broke, who knows) promised, in writing, as part of resolving the situation at a company, to pay me six figures. Then they didn\u2019t pay, then once again in person affirmed this and promised to pay, then didn\u2019t pay. What am I going to do, sue them? When they have a history of vindictive behavior? Money gone.</p>\n<p>Mostly it works out fine. Credit cards are kind of an alternative to small claims court, and there are various reputational and other reasons that allow ordinary business to continue even if it is not in practice enforced by law. But also we all choose to avoid transactions that would depend on the threat of a small-stakes lawsuit.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Police</h4>\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re wondering why we can\u2019t go back?

Odd to say activity did not decrease if discretionary arrests decreased. That is at the core of police activity. If you are making less arrests, then it stands to reason you would also use less force. We would like to think the training made police make better decisions, but we cannot differentiate that from the possibility that police got the message to find reasons to make fewer arrests.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/12/police-work-at-the-private-margin.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=police-work-at-the-private-margin\">A working paper</a> <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w31985#fromrss\">says</a> that police lower quantity of arrests but increase arrest quality near the end of their shifts, when arrests would require overtime work, and that this effect is stronger when the officer works a second job.

If they read you your Miranda rights, you\u2019re a suspect. Shut it down. Demand a lawyer. This is just some of the advice I got from a retired FBI Special Agent, and two renowned false confessions experts.</p>\n<p>After talking with half a dozen exonerees who\u2019d been coerced into making false confessions, and interviewing the world\u2019s leading experts, I wanted to know what advice they\u2019d give. Here\u2019s what they said&#8230;</p>\n<p>FBI Agent Steve Moore (@Gman_Moore): If they ever make an accusation against you, you\u2019re no longer a witness. You say, I&#8217;m leaving. Get a lawyer.</p>\n<p>If they say you&#8217;re not allowed to leave, to see a lawyer, or talk to a parent or spouse, get a piece of paper and write that down, write down the time, and ask them to sign it. If they won\u2019t sign it, fold it up in your pocket.</p>\n<p>Make a record of everything you do. They&#8217;re taking notes; you take notes. If you&#8217;re innocent, you&#8217;ve got nothing to lose.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t repeat your story. When they say, Tell us what happened, tell them what happened. When they say, OK, let&#8217;s start over. Let&#8217;s go back to that room. You say, Nope, already asked and answered.</p>\n<p>What they&#8217;re trying to do is manipulate and confuse you. Then when your stories don&#8217;t match up perfectly, they\u2019ll say, But you said you went through the front door at 11, and now you&#8217;re saying 10:30. What else could have you gotten wrong?</p>\n<p>False confessions expert Steve Drizin (@SDrizin): Once they read you your Miranda warnings, you are a suspect. Do not sign a waiver to give them up. Those Miranda rights are precious. Don\u2019t throw them away like garbage, no matter how much police try to get you to do that.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a witness, tell the truth and then shut up. When they start to try to change your truth to fit their truth, you shut it down. If they&#8217;re not accepting your truth, say, No more. I&#8217;m not going to talk until I have a lawyer.</p>\n<p>False confessions expert Richard Leo: Insist on recording any statement. We all have smartphones. Once you start being accused, they&#8217;ve made up their mind and their goal is to get a confession.</p>\n<p>Most people&#8217;s interactions with police are in automobiles. The police say, Do you know why I stopped you? It&#8217;s a trick question designed to get you to confess. And when the police stop you in your car, you&#8217;re not free to leave.</p>\n<p>Remember, if you&#8217;re in custody and police seek to elicit incriminating statements, you&#8217;re entitled to Miranda warnings. But the Supreme Court, going back to the 80s, gaslighted Americans by saying that you&#8217;re not in custody when you\u2019re pulled over.</p>\n<p>So you&#8217;re not entitled to Miranda warnings. So the police just say, Do you know why I pulled you over? You might say, Well, maybe I was going 10 miles over the speed limit? You\u2019ve just confessed. (Instead, say, I have no idea.)</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t ask police, Should I get a lawyer? Because they are your adversary if they are trying to get evidence against you of a crime and you may not even know it. Be instinctively distrustful. Be respectful, cooperate if it&#8217;s purely a witness role\u2026</p>\n<p>But once they start to accuse you or you feel accused, certainly if you&#8217;ve been read your Miranda warnings, there&#8217;s no percentage in talking to them. They are professional liars. They&#8217;re very good at it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/amandaknox/status/1869484195669758344\">[thread continues</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/111-false-confessions-part-6-scars-and-solutions/id1494368441?i=1000680823430\">podcast link</a>]</p></blockquote>\n<p>One can summarize that as \u2018be respectful and comply with their physical demands, and if they treat you like a witness (and you didn\u2019t do anything illegal) tell the truth, but if they ever accuse you of anything, try to get you to change your story or ask you to repeat yourself or act like you are a suspect get a lawyer and never ever confess to anything even speeding and of course never sign away Miranda.\u2019</p>\n<p>That seems like the bare minimum amount of wariness?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/IanHuyett/status/1962568657017385251\">Ian Huyett is even more stark</a>, and advises you to treat police interrogations as if the police are playing a game where every time you provide an answer this is a puzzle piece, and their goal is to string together enough puzzle pieces to show you are guilty, which may or may not involve a confession. Anything you say only generates more blocks, so shut up and say \u2018I invoke my right to remain silent and my right to counsel,\u2019 which are a magic incantation that makes them leave the room.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ian Huyett: So far every defense attorney or cop who has interacted with my take agrees with it. Yet in Fleischman&#8217;s replies you can see smart people outside those groups\u2014e.g. a journalist followed by Yarvin and Cr\u00e9mieux\u2014who believe some suspects &#8220;have nothing to hide.&#8221; It&#8217;s not about common sense, it&#8217;s a knowledge issue. You either know how this works or you don&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The premise here is that once they decide you are a suspect, the police are usually not interested in the game of \u2018let\u2019s all work together to establish the truth\u2019 and are thus not playing it, nor are you in a good position to change their mind on that via answering questions, so answering questions only has downside for you. That includes that if you do a perfect job, it won\u2019t be usable by you in court unless you testify:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/ASFleischman/status/1962197687060602964\">Andrew Fleischman</a>: An important note about talking to police:</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you talk to police for two hours, and you provide an immediately, perfectly plausible account of your innocence. It&#8217;s on tape.</p>\n<p>Almost no judge will let you play that tape for the jury without testifying.</p>\n<p>If you fuck up, it comes in automatically. If you&#8217;re perfect, it stays out nearly automatically. There is no upside.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There is still a line, below which not providing information is counterproductive. You don\u2019t want to piss them off or draw the wrong kind of attention when the stakes are otherwise very low.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nate Fischer: Where is the line where you should be extremely wary? On the spectrum between passive victim to witness to clear suspect. What would you see as the key tells that laymen should keep in mind?</p>\n<p>Ian Huyett: With anything much past a speeding ticket I think laypeople should err on the side of caution and stick to my OP.</p>\n<p>A lot of people are responding that they refuse to talk to any cop that pulls them over. That\u2019s counterproductive. Being candid and cordial even about your own minor traffic offenses, or as someone who is clearly just a witness, is the best approach.</p>\n<p>The Tetris game is engaged when it\u2019s a real crime. If you have any reason to think you might be suspected of one, the best rule &#8211; even for lawyers &#8211; is to assume the worst, err on the safe side, and stick to the script.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7o9xYp7eE&amp;ab_channel=RegentUniversitySchoolofLaw\">The classic maximalist take is this video, Don\u2019t Talk to the Police</a>, as in make no statement under any circumstances whatsoever.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Probation</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/i/152754467/comments-on-probation\">This section of ACX\u2019s comments post on prisons discussed probation</a>.</p>\n<p>According to several commentators, probation is essentially a trap, or a scam.</p>\n<p>In theory, probation says that you get let go early, but if you screw up, you go back. Screwing up means violating basically any law, or being one minute late to a probation meeting, or losing your job (including because the probation officer changed your meeting to be when you had to work and got you fired), or any number of other rules.</p>\n<p>One can imagine a few ways this could work, on a spectrum.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>This is leverage, to be used for your own good and for police business, but everyone wants you to succeed. If the police need your cooperation, they can threaten to send you back. If the police think someone or some activity is trouble, they can tell you to not associate with or do them. And so on. The rules have to mean something, but if you\u2019re clearly trying to turn your life around then they\u2019ll cut you some slack.</li>\n<li>This is a test. The system is neither your friend nor your enemy. Actions have consequences. And yes, if we are pretty sure you\u2019re up to no good we\u2019ll go looking for a technical reason to violate you, but otherwise good luck.</li>\n<li>This is a backdoor and a trap, and the system will be actively attempting to send you back to prison as soon as possible.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The reports are that the de facto point of probation is the third thing, that probation officers will actively seek to violate people and send them back to prison even if they\u2019re not doing anything wrong. Thus probation is a substantial portion as bad as being in prison, and then you probably fail and go to prison anyway.</p>\n<p>In this model, the entire system is in bad faith here, and they\u2019re offering you probation to avoid a trial knowing they\u2019ll then be able to screw you over later.</p>\n<p>And that this is true to the extent that realistic criminals often turn down probation if the alternative is a shorter overall sentence.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thehighcourt.co/probation-stats/\">My quick search said</a> about 54% of those paroled fail and get sent back.</p>\n<p>A commenter says parole is actually the first thing, they want you to succeed and not have to imprison you. Whereas straight probation off a plea bargain is the third thing, where they want to avoid a trial then imprison you anyway.</p>\n<p>This is offered as the reason people don\u2019t accept GPS monitoring. If you have a GPS monitor, then it is easy to notice you\u2019ve technically violated the terms, and since everyone involved wants to violate you, that means you\u2019re doomed.</p>\n<p>Scott Alexander interprets \u2018someone on probation got two years for driving the speed limit because it was technically a violation in context\u2019 as a outrageous strictness. Which it is, but the two years was really for the original crime the guy got probation for, not for the technical violation. So it\u2019s more like the system lying and being evil, rather than it being too strict per se.</p>\n<p>My presumption is that in some contexts you are in each of the three scenarios, which is largely based on whether you are viewed by the system and your probation officer as a criminal. If it\u2019s either \u2018you\u2019ve done your time and now it\u2019s time for you to make good\u2019 or \u2018you made one mistake and we had to put you on probation\u2019 then you get scenario one. If they think you\u2019re no good then it\u2019s going to be scenario three. So habitual criminals realize they\u2019re going to be in scenario three and turn it down, whereas white collar probation-only plea bargains are probably fine.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Genetic Databases</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1865167130494128197\">When Denmark expanded its database of genetic information</a>, crime rates fell dramatically.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v_J4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66bb1fd9-4d16-49f0-8d51-032be4a19f76_1167x802.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<blockquote><p>Cremieux: <a href=\"https://t.co/DimJ7vBgxB\">The magnitude</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/nwwvHOUu6w\">of this effect</a> is fairly staggering, too: the elasticity is -2.7, meaning that for every 1% increase in the number of criminals in the database, recidivist crime falls by 2.7%. That&#8217;s enormous (-42% to the 1-year recidivism rate)<em>, </em>and that&#8217;s simply due to the fear that, if you commit a crime again, you&#8217;ll now be detected doing it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is insanely strong evidence that the prediction of being caught is a huge driver of recidivism rates. A 42% drop in 1-year recidivism is crazy. The rate of being caught went up, but it didn\u2019t go up that dramatically.</p>\n<p>America saw similar results, although smaller.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Cremieux: Several American states have mandated that prisoners need to provide their DNA to the authorities, and after those programs came into place, there was a large reduction in the odds of recidivism for affected criminals.</p>\n<p>This result is highly significant for violent offenders, but less so for property offenders, with mandates reducing violent recidivism by a whopping 5.7pp over five years, or in percentage terms, they reduced violent criminal recidivism by 21%.</p></blockquote>\n<p>What we need to do is a study of criminals perceptions of likelihood of being caught with and without the DNA database, and in general, and how those perceptions predict their actions, so we can better establish the effect size here and what else impacts it.</p>\n<p>There are obvious libertarian objections to a universal DNA database. But if the upside was a 42% overall drop in crime, potentially a lot more since this would then change norms and free up police for other cases?

That would have helped somewhat with various legal and tax problems, but still have left everything a mess. <a href=\"https://manifold.markets/BTE/will-marijuana-be-rescheduled-by-th\">It seems the clock will run out on them, instead, as per prediction markets.</a></p>\n<p>I am libertarian on such matters, but also I am <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wJXBUfcIOE&amp;ab_channel=Movieclips\">generally strongly anti-marijuana</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1867270055551283581\">Matthew Yglesias</a>: I like that \u201cgetting high a lot is probably a bad idea\u201d has become a contrarian take.</p>\n<p>Andrew Huberman: People have been experiencing the incredible benefits of reducing their alcohol intake &amp; in some cases eliminating it altogether. I believe cannabis is next. For improving sleep and drive.</p>\n<p>Note: I\u2019m not anti-cannabis for people that maintain high productivity and mental health.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I don\u2019t think marijuana is typically good for those that use it, especially for those that use it a lot. I believe you are probably better off using it never (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBK39BKWuQg&amp;pp=ygUZbmV2ZXIgd2hhdCBuZXZlciBwaW5hZm9yZQ%3D%3D\">or hardly ever</a> but for humans never is easier) than trying to figure out the right times when you can get net benefits. There are of course exceptions, especially certain types of creatives, and also medical reasons to use it.</p>\n<p>Similarly to what I concluded about sports gambling, I don\u2019t think we should make it effectively criminal, but I believe that there needs to be some friction around marijuana use.</p>\n<p>Another way to think about this is, you should ensure that your formerly illegal activities have at least as many regulatory barriers as your pro-social activities like selling food or building a house.</p>\n<p>Steve Sailer points out that one important risk of legalizing vice is that <a href=\"https://www.stevesailer.net/p/why-legalizing-vice-in-corporate\">legalization vastly increases the quality of marketing campaigns</a>, the way that legalizing sports gambling made ads for it ubiquitous. In addition, it increases the reach and options available, grows the market and shifts norms.</p>\n<p>So yes, I think some form of \u2018soft illegal\u2019 or semi-legal is the way to go here.</p>\n<p>If you go fully legal, you get what we\u2019ve been seeing in New York City. There is massive overuse, and a huge percentage of new leases on New York City storefronts have been illegal cannabis shops getting busted. They don\u2019t cause trouble, but that leaves less room for everything else, and often the city actively smells of the stuff.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Brad Hargreaves: And so the process of shutting down all the unlicensed dispensaries in NYC begins.

Per the law, weed could only be sold through state-licensed shops. A new regulatory agency was created.</p>\n<p>These licenses would be provisioned through a complex process that prioritized (among other things) people with past drug convictions.</p>\n<p>But the process of issuing these licenses was slow and the process onerous. It dragged on for years with no licenses issued.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, cops stopped enforcing any laws around selling weed (among others). As enforcement waned, sneaky attempts to sell weed from bodegas transformed into full-blown unlicensed weed emporiums.</p>\n<p>Entrepreneurs dumped <img alt=\"\ud83d\udcb0\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f4b0.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /><img alt=\"\ud83d\udcb0\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f4b0.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /> into retail build-outs.</p>\n<p>On a stretch of 8th Avenue in Chelsea, Manhattan, a majority of all new retail leases signed were for weed shops.</p>\n<p>Some of them were really nice!

Finally, it&#8217;s happening.</p>\n<p>Now, all those new retail spaces that opened? Permanently closed.</p>\n<p>Now there&#8217;s going to be a flood of new, vacant retail hitting the market in Manhattan, particularly in neighborhoods like Chelsea and the Village.</p>\n<p>All just because the state couldn&#8217;t get its act together and police let the issue fester for three years.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Seriously, it was totally nuts. Still is, although I report things are improving, and Eric Adams did indeed shut down a lot of the illegal places, eventually. Nature is healing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.is/49fkZ\">Here is a NYT article about New York\u2019s disastrous legalization implementation</a>. There is a tension between complaints about the botched implementation, of which there can be no doubt, versus worry that marijuana is too addictive and harmful to be fully legalized even if implemented well.</p>\n<p>Similarly <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/06/08/canada-british-columbia-decriminalization-drugs-overdose/\">British Columbia is recriminalizing marijuana</a> after a three year trial run amid growing reports of public drug use.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Economics of Fentanyl</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/markets-in-everything-fentanyl-precursors.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=markets-in-everything-fentanyl-precursors\">Alex Tabarrok does the math</a> on an otherwise excellent <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/drugs-fentanyl-supplychain/\">Reuters exploration of Fentanyl production</a>, and is suspicious of the profit margins. A gram of cocaine he says costs about $160 on the street and $13-$70 trafficked into the USA to sell, whereas Reuters claimed to have gotten precursors for 3 million tablets of Fentanyl for only $3607.18, which Alex estimates sells for $1.5 million. That\u2019s crazy, although there are other costs of production, even if you assume they missed some ingredients.</p>\n<p>One could model this as the cost of precursor goods being purely in risk of punishment during the process, with the dollar costs being essentially zero. Actually making the drug is dirt cheap, but the process of assembling and distributing it carries risks, and the street price (estimated at $0.50 per tablet) is almost entirely that risk plus time costs for distribution.</p>\n<p>If you fully legalized Fentanyl, putting it into Category 1, the price would go to almost zero, which would not be pretty.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, why are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/05/31/mexico-united-states-fentanyl-seizure-drop/\">Fentanyl seizures plummeting at the Mexican border</a>?</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mary Beth Sheridan (May 2025): The U.S. government\u2019s average monthly seizures of fentanyl at the Mexican border have dropped by more than half \u2014 from 1,700 pounds in 2024, to 746 pounds this year, according to Customs and Border Protection data.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is framed as a mystery, why would deploying lots of troops and drones to the border not make seizures go up?</p>\n<p>Well, one possibility is that\u2019s how the curve works. If you do no enforcement you get nothing. If you do a little, you get a lot per enforcer but not much overall. If you enforce well enough people stop trying to smuggle, you eventually start getting less. If you had perfect enforcement you would not seize zero pounds, because some people are deeply stupid, but you would quickly seize very little. I doubt that we are on the \u2018good side\u2019 of the curve here, but it has to be considered as a possibility.</p>\n<p>One suggestion from the post is a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/11/16/mexico-sinaloa-cartel-power-struggle/\">war within the Sinaloa cartel</a>, another a shortage of ingredients, or perhaps a drop in demand due to declines in quality and customer adjustments for how likely Fentanyl is to outright kill you.</p>\n<p>Also good news: Overdose deaths dropped to 80k in 2024 from a peak of 110k in 2023.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Jails</h4>\n\n\n<p>It has always been very bizarre to me the things we tolerate in prisons.</p>\n<p>This includes letting them be effectively run by criminal gangs, and normalizing rape, but also commercial exploitations like the <a href=\"https://x.com/NewYorker/status/1791900508917002665\">claim that</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ZZrQtsUM42\">some jails are preventing inmates</a> from having visitors so Securus Technologies can charge over a dollar a minute for video calls instead, versus the mind boggling overall cost of jails.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/paulnovosad/status/1848486619814498364\">Perhaps we should not have our prisons not be incubators of criminality</a>, where inmates are isolated from any outside influences and left to largely govern themselves?</p>\n<p>Even if prison isn\u2019t purely rehabilitation, it shouldn\u2019t be actively the opposite of that.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Abstract: Abstract: 45% of Americans have an immediate family member who has been incarcerated, and over $80 billion is spent each year on the public corrections system. Yet, the United States misses a major opportunity by focusing most rehabilitative programs right around the time that individuals are released from carceral facilities, instead of intervening throughout the period of incarceration. In this paper, we study an in-prison intervention targeting a costly aspect of life for incarcerated individuals\u2014audio and video calls.</p>\n<p>We evaluate the impact of free audio and video calls utilizing the staggered roll out of this technology across lowa&#8217;s nine state prisons between 2021 and 2022. We find evidence of a 30% reduction in in-prison misconduct, including a 45% decline in violent incidents and threats of violence. Our results indicate potentially large returns to prison communication policy reforms that are currently underway across the U.S.</p>\n<p>Paul Novosad: These are billion dollar bills on the sidewalk. Crime and recidivism are so costly to communities. Just having the human decency to let incarcerated people talk to their relatives reduces violent behavior A LOT. It&#8217;s also just a basic human decency.</p>\n<p>Gunnar Blix: The whole mindset switch from \u201cpunishment\u201d to \u201crehabilitation\u201d (for the 95% of cases where it makes sense) is huge. Growing up in Norway, I remember when the maximum sentence was reduced to 21 years (effectively 14). And \u201cprison\u201d in Norway is not what you see in American films.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As in, if you give prisoners free audio and video calls, which costs you approximately nothing, you see dramatic improvements in prisoner behavior, and a far less toxic environment. The direction makes sense, the magnitude of the change is stunning. I don\u2019t want to trust a single study, but also there is little downside here &#8211; introduce this in a bunch more places, and take advantage of the natural experiment, then go from there.</p>\n<p>If we want to do punishment for punishment\u2019s sake, we have plenty of options for that. Cutting people off from the outside seems like one of the worst ones, especially since actual crime bosses can already get cell phones anyway. It also gives you powerful leverage &#8211; you default to calls for free, and have the power to take them away.</p>\n<p>Instead, we do the exact opposite. Not only are calls not free, we actively limit contact with the outside, especially the influences that would be most positive, in the name of extracting tiny amounts of money.</p>\n<p>Whenever I hear about such abuses, two things stick in my mind: The absurdly high amount we pay to keep people in prison, and the absurdly low amounts of money over which we torture the inmates and their families. I don\u2019t \u2018have a study\u2019 but it seems obvious that allowing more outside communication would be good for rehabilitation, as well as being the right thing to do.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ilex_ulmus/status/1799895639280763083\">On a related note: Almost all prison rape jokes are pretty terrible</a>. We have come a long way on so many related questions, yet somehow this is still considered acceptable by many who otherwise claim to champion exactly the reasons this is not okay. If we are going to ruin comedy, let\u2019s do it where it is maximally justified.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Criminals</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RiverTamYDN/status/1789833420190720431\">Would criminals largely be unable to handle hypotheticals?</a> If they were, asks River Tam, then how is it they can handle sports hypotheticals with no trouble, as you can demonstrate by asking them if LeBron would beat Jordan one-on-one. This seems entirely compatible with the same people being unable, in practice, to follow other hypotheticals that don\u2019t match their own experiences. They have learned that such tactics are in practice often a trap In Their Culture, so they are having none of it. That doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t or don\u2019t think about hypotheticals.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Causes of Crime</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1671716213762686979\">A well-known result is that releasing a Grand Theft Auto game</a>, or other popular entertainment product, short term lowers crime as criminals consume the entertainment rather than commit crime (<a href=\"https://t.co/9LOEliJyIK\">paper</a>). Whereas Pokemon Go was deadly, since it encouraged people to go outside. This is of course a deep confusion of short run versus long run effects. What matters are the long run impacts, which this fails to measure. Presumably we all agree that \u2018go for a walk\u2019 is a healthy thing, not a deadly thing, even though today it would be \u2018safer\u2019 to stay home on a given day.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Causes of Violence</h4>\n\n\n<p>From Vital City, <a href=\"https://www.vitalcitynyc.org/articles/does-nothing-stop-a-bullet-like-a-job\">the case that violence tends to be a crime of passion</a>, and jobs and transfer programs and prosperity help with property crime but have little impact on violence, versus the cast that<a href=\"https://www.vitalcitynyc.org/articles/stemming-violence-investing-in-civic-goods\"> investments in things like summer jobs, neighborhood improvements and services reduces crime</a>, including violent crime.</p>\n<p>My instinct is to believe the second result directionally, while strongly doubting the magnitude of the intervention studies quoted. There is not as big a contradiction here as one might think. Violent crimes are typically crimes of passion, but even among those incidents, the circumstances that cause that, and the cultural conditions that cause that, are not randomly distributed. You can alter that.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately anti-poverty programs as such do not seem to move the needle on that in the short term. In the short term, my guess is that if you want to act at scale you must shift the social conditions more directly linked to violence triggers, or <a href=\"https://x.com/Abt_Thomas/status/1791469412823810341\">teach people various variations on CBT and help them alter their behavior</a>.</p>\n<p>As for the first result, I can believe that the correlations and intervention effects are smaller, but I find the general claim of \u2018prosperity and employment do not decrease violence\u2019 as obviously absurd, especially when stated as \u2018poverty and unemployment do not lead to increased violence.\u2019</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Homelessness</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/tracewoodgrains/status/1845313660035420571\">How should we think about homelessness, and the fear of becoming homeless?</a> Most of those who are long term homeless, as I understand it, have severe problems, but that doesn\u2019t mean the threat of this isn\u2019t hanging over a lot of people\u2019s heads all the time, especially with the decreasing ability to turn to family and friends. Also people correctly treat the nightmare as starting with the threat becoming real and close, that\u2019s already bad enough. I think this is part of why a lot of people are under the impression that a huge percentage of Americans live \u2018paycheck to paycheck\u2019 in ways that put them \u2018one paycheck away\u2019 from homelessness and total collapse, in a way that seems clearly untrue &#8211; a lot of people are one paycheck away from being too close to the edge and starting to panic, or having to tap resources and options they\u2019d rather not tap, which sucks, but that\u2019s different from actually falling over that edge.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Yay Trivial Inconveniences</h4>\n\n\n<p>From Scott Alexander\u2019s report on the Progress Studies conference, it turns out <a href=\"https://x.com/TimGalebach/status/1850197575082889262\">forcing people to pay the fare instantly transformed SF\u2019s BART trains to be safe and clean?</a> Although there is skepticism given how few stations even have the new gates yet.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Tim Galebach: A big influencer, with a lot of online haters, once told me that gating any piece of content at &gt; $1 screened out nearly all haters.</p>\n<p>Visakan Veerasamy: and the haters who are willing to pay to show up are quite entertaining, they&#8217;re more high-effort haters who actually do the reading etc.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">San Francisco</h4>\n\n\n<p>The government of San Francisco has historically been the epitome of the pattern of putting up (Category 2) barriers to productive and pro-social activities like doing business and building housing, but giving de facto (Category 1) carte blanche to a variety of activities we would like to see happen less often.</p>\n<p>Thus, <a href=\"https://x.com/theSamPadilla/status/1790607609063498106\">San Francisco has some issues with drugs and homelessness, an ongoing series.</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>Sam Padilla: Holy fucking shit.</p>\n<p>I just walked from Soma to Hayes Valley through Market St and easily sketchiest walk of my life.</p>\n<p>And dude I grew up in Brazil and Colombia.

The only businesses you can reasonably open are the illegal harmful ones. That does not seem likely to go well over time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/SwannMarcus89/status/1818360263932100857\">Many nonprofits in San Francisco seem increasingly inaccurately named.</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>Swann Marcus: lol this is like the third SF non-profit that got in trouble for this exact thing in the last three months.</p>\n<p>SF District Attorney: The SF District Attorney\u2019s Office announced today the arrest of Kyra Worthy, the former executive director of the nonprofit SF SAFE, on 34 felony charges related to misappropriation of public money, submitting fraudulent invoices to a City department, theft from SF SAFE, wage theft from its employees &amp; failing to pay withheld employee taxes + writing checks w/ insufficient funds to defraud a bank.</p>\n<p>Ms. Worthy is accused of illegally misusing over $700,000 during her tenure w/ SF SAFE.</p>\n<p>Ms. Worthy was arrested today by SFDA Investigators.</p>\n<p>Because of SF SAFE\u2019s relationship w/ SFPD, SFPD asked the SFDA Office to undertake this investigation.

You may remain anonymous.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I constantly hear that various nonprofit organizations working with the city of San Francisco are, rather than trying to help with social problems, very much criminal for-profit enterprises working to warp public policy to increase profits.</p>\n<p>Is the underlying situation quite bad?

By ages I mean months. Everything escalates quickly now. And since I wrote the rest of this passage it has been several months more and people say things are continuing to improve.</p>\n<p>Even those months ago, I\u2019d seen <a href=\"https://x.com/michelletandler/status/1907545467514388814\">several claims</a> that in a matter of months <a href=\"https://x.com/paulg/status/1909175520756900226\">they\u2019ve managed to clean up San Francisco</a>. This included that reported <a href=\"https://t.co/8YOhGWYzO6\">property crimes dropped by 45%</a>, which of course has two potential causes that imply very different conclusions.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s some actually hard evidence that the San Francisco cleanup is working, presented in the absolute funniest way possible.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Joey Politano: the headline is perhaps one of the greatest examples of media\u2019s negativity bias in history.</p>\n<p>Rohin Dhar: Auto glass repair companies in San Francisco are apparently seeing a drastic decline in business:</p>\n<p>\u201cWe used to get 60 to 80 calls a day,\u201d said Hank Wee, manager of In &amp; Out Auto Glass</p>\n<p>\u201cNow we\u2019re lucky to get 25\u201d</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gw1U!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67070d43-9024-46b6-99f2-ea4eaff17130_900x672.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perfect. We now have a highly reliable car theft index. We used to get 70 calls a day, now we get about 20. Combining this with other sources from both auto shops and other crime stats, we are likely looking at about a 65% drop in car break-ins, although only a 12% decline in whole-car thefts.</p>\n<p>This also can make us confident that other crime statistics are moving due to reduced actual crime, rather than due to reduced reporting of crime.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/michelletandler/status/1912217008722321604\">Michelle Tandler</a>: Crime is down 46% in San Francisco compared to 2020.</p>\n<p>In 2020, we had a Progressive DA and Board.</p>\n<p>Now we have Moderate leaders.

That sounds absurd, but <a href=\"https://x.com/SheriffJCooper/status/1722744442782937438\">Jim Cooper, Sacramento County Sheriff, actually has a good response</a>.</p>\n<p>That response is: If you are not allowing the police to enforce the law, the least you can do is stop whining about it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Jim Cooper (Sheriff of Sacramento) (Nov. 2023): I can\u2019t make this up. Recently, we tried to help Target. Our property crimes detectives and a sergeant were contacted numerous times by Target to assist with shoplifters, mostly known transients. We coordinated with them and set up an operation with detectives and our North POP team.</p>\n<p>At the briefing, their regional security head told us we could not contact suspects inside the store; we could not handcuff suspects in the store; and if we arrested someone, they wanted us to process them outside, behind the store, in the rain.</p>\n<p>We were told they did not want to create a scene inside the store and have people film it and post it on social media. They did not want negative press. Unbelievable.</p>\n<p>Our deputies observed a woman on camera bring her own shopping bags, go down the body wash aisle, and take a number of bottles of Native-brand body wash. Then she went to customer service and returned them! Target chose to do nothing and simply let it happen. Yet, somehow, locking up deodorant and raising prices on everyday necessities is their best response.</p>\n<p>We do not dictate how big retailers should conduct their business; they should not dictate how we do ours.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is so insane. How are you going to deter crime if you literally are afraid to have anyone spreading the word that those who rob your stores might face punishment?</p>\n<p>I hope we have now reached the point where \u2018shoplifters arrested in your store by police\u2019 is seen as a good thing?</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Solving for the Equilibrium (1)</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/bryan_caplan/status/1817908596723601779\">This is an interesting gambit</a>, fine the shoplifters directly or else.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Bryan Caplan: From a reader:</p>\n<p>Spotted this in Olive Young (a cosmetics store in Seoul).</p>\n<p>Should this be normalised? I feel allowing Private businesses to ask for payment in exchange for non reporting criminals is something you&#8217;d love but the general public would dislike (as where does it end? Do you run CCTV blackmail schemes for muggers? Or is it only the victim who can ask for the payment?).</p>\n<p>Also it is written in English, clearly the criminals are often not Korean, perhaps East Asia experiences more immigrant crime as the baseline is so low?</p>\n<p>Jared Walczak: I fear it would increase casual (not organized) shoplifting because the stakes are substantially lowered. It becomes something more akin to deciding to &#8220;risk&#8221; going ten minutes over on a 2-hour meter rather than a stark line you simply can&#8217;t cross.</p>\n<p>TakForDetElon: This policy wouldn&#8217;t work in San Francisco. Shoplifter would just say &#8220;call the police&#8221;.</p></blockquote>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HKxZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F53da485d-1b68-4814-bdbe-30c115a1be3c_3072x4080.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Indeed, this only works if calling the police is worse than paying the fine. If the police wouldn\u2019t do anything, then the threat is empty.</p>\n<p>The bigger issue is that if the chance of being caught is under 20%, or people think it is, then all you are doing is minimizing their risk. And indeed, it is widely believed that 5% or less of shoplifting attempts are caught. One can even see people treating this as an invitation as noted above &#8211; shoplifting is now a game, win one or lose five, not a hard line.</p>\n<p>Of course, they are not quite promising to make this offer to everyone, merely to do one action or the other.</p>\n<p>The obvious ethical objection is that those who can pay and really should therefore have the police called will pay, and those who cannot pay and thus have some real need get the police called. And the worries about where does it end.</p>\n<p>Where I do think this is good is as a way to use limited police resources to get full deterrence. You can\u2019t call the police every time, it\u2019s too expensive for everyone. But you can credibly threaten to call the police if the conditional means you rarely have to actually call them. The threat is stronger than its execution, but to make that work the threat needs to be credible.</p>\n<p>The other equilibrium is that shoplifters are essentially not prosecuted at all because there are too many of them, and this seems to be a case of <a href=\"https://x.com/pursuitofprog/status/1862073205709570229\">many jurisdictions f***ing around and finding out</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Lawrence Newport (talking about UK): Shoplifting is up in 97% of constituencies [since 2022]. Some have almost doubled in a year.</p>\n<p>Reality is worse as most go unreported.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s been a complete collapse in the ability/availability of police to catch or stop this.</p>\n<p>In many cases shoplifting has become essentially legal.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Then there\u2019s the statistics on bike theft, which are even more dismal, <a href=\"https://x.com/pursuitofprog/status/1863167979019473383\">and a rather clear test example.</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>Lawrence Newport: We left a bike with GPS trackers somewhere we assumed would be safe.</p>\n<p>Right outside Scotland Yard.</p>\n<p>It was quickly stolen.</p>\n<p>Police did not check security camera footage, could not follow a \u201cmoving\u201d GPS signal or one at an address.</p>\n<p>The government has given up, and police cannot focus on the rampant theft.</p>\n<p>This only changed when The Telegraph called the Metropolitan Police, and suddenly . . . they are now going to check the security camera footage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/crush_crime/status/1863204089074483691\">Crush Crime</a>: CSEW estimates 207,000 bikes were stolen last year.</p>\n<p>Only 2 percent of cases resulted in a suspect being charged.</p>\n<p>Theft is legal in Britain.</p>\n<p>The government must be made to act, or else this will not stop.</p>\n<p>Vinesh Patel: I owned a small chain of fast food outlets once, teenage gangs would steal thefts and even assault staff. We supplied cctv footage, never received a response. I wrote a letter of complaint to the Police Lambeth. They had lost the CCTV footage &amp; asked for it again 6 months later.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A simple heuristic needs to be \u2018if you provide me with video evidence of the crime I will at least then actually look into it.\u2019 If not, well, we should be thankful it\u2019s taking so long to solve for the other equilibrium.</p>\n<p>Whereas this is your reminder that <a href=\"https://x.com/Peston/status/1863690883138281930\">it seems in the UK the police claim they are actively not allowed to act on location data even for a stolen phone that is still o</a>n, let alone CCTV footage? Even with everything else I know, I can\u2019t even at this point.

Our estimates suggest the abatement of lead pollution may be responsible for 7\u201328% of the fall in homicide in the US. Given the historically higher urban lead levels, reduced lead pollution accounted for 6\u201320% of the convergence in US urban and rural crime rates.
