You might know a bit about the sort of<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/02/17/pharma-virumque/\"> subtle measures pharmaceutical companies take</a> to influence doctors&#8217; prescribing habits, or how it takes<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/060115/how-much-drug-companys-spending-allocated-research-and-development-average.asp\"> billions of dollars</a> on average to bring a new medication to market, or something about the<a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/adumbrations-of-aducanumab\"> perverse incentives</a> which determine the FDA&#8217;s standards for accepting or rejecting a new drug. You might have some idea what kinds of<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/29/my-irb-nightmare/\"> hoops</a> a company has to jump through to conduct actual research which meets legal guidelines for patient safety and autonomy.</p><p>You may be less familiar though, with how the sausage is actually made. How do pharmaceutical companies <em>actually</em> go through the process of testing a drug on human participants?</p><p>I&#8217;m going to be focusing here on a research subject&#8217;s view of what are known as Phase I clinical trials, the stage in which prospective drugs are tested for safety and tolerability. This is where researchers aim to answer questions like &#8220;Does this drug have any dangerous side effects?&#8221; &#8220;Through what pathways is it removed from a patient&#8217;s body?&#8221; and &#8220;Can we actually give people enough of this drug that it&#8217;s useful for anything?&#8221; This comes before the stage where researchers test how good a drug is at actually treating any sort of disease, when patients who&#8217;re suffering from the target ailments are given the option receive it as an experimental treatment. In Phase I clinical trials, the participants are healthy volunteers who&#8217;re participating in research for money. There are almost no cases in which volunteer participation is driven by motivations other than money, because the attitudes between research participants and clinicians overwhelmingly tend to be characterized by mutual guarded distrust. This distrust is baked into the process, both on a cultural level among the participants, and by the clinics&#8217; own incentives.</p><p>All of what follows is drawn from my own experiences, and experiences that other participants in clinical pharmaceutical research have shared with me, because for reasons which should become clear over the course of this review, research which systematically explores the behaviors and motives of clinical research participants is generally not feasible to conduct.</p><h1>Part 1: What is participating in a clinical study actually like?</h1><p>You start by looking up the studies available at a particular site. This may involve browsing their website for offerings, or it may involve simply calling up the clinic and asking what&#8217;s currently available. Because many research clinics do not actually bother to keep their websites up-to-date, participants are incentivized to do the latter, which applies an<a href=\"https://mrsteinberg.com/the-asshole-filter/\"> asshole filter</a> to clinics&#8217; participant populations. This will be relevant later.</p><p>The clinic representative or website will tell you how much the available studies pay and how long you&#8217;ll have to stay at the clinic. They usually will not tell you the intended purpose of the study drug; that comes during the phone screening, where they run through a laundry list of exclusion criteria (do you have an appropriate BMI to participate in the study? Do you have any relatives who work at the clinic? Do you have a history of any sort of disease which might appear in your bloodwork? Etc.) Once you make it through the phone screening, they will schedule an in-person screening at the clinic.</p><p>At your in-person screening, if it&#8217;s your first time at the clinic, they will go over your entire medical history, and ask about your relationship with every sort of disease, disorder and medical event known to man. In defiance of statistical probability, you will tell them that you are in perfect health with no record of medical events whatsoever. You might be tempted to be honest, but as we&#8217;ll address later, this is a mistake which the participant population on the whole has been trained out of. You will give them your payment information, so they can pay you for your study participation, and they will subject you to a battery of physical tests (blood tests, urine tests, temperature, pulse and ECGs, plus any tests idiosyncratic to a particular study) which determine whether you meet that study&#8217;s eligibility criteria.</p><p>You&#8217;ll also receive my personal favorite component of the clinical research process, an Informed Consent Form, which details everything the clinic is legally obligated to tell you about the contents of the study so that you can offer your consent to participate. These forms are not in any respect fun; they&#8217;re tedious to read, and probably an absolute slog for the clinics to put together. On the odd occasion where the clinic makes any small change to the procedure after you&#8217;ve signed, they have to bring you in to receive a whole new copy of the consent form, and point out the changes so you can sign all over again. They have staff on hand to go over them with you to make sure you&#8217;ve actually read them and understand the contents. The whole process is frankly a bit obnoxious, but when I compare it to actual employment contracts I&#8217;ve signed in the past, I can&#8217;t help but appreciate just how much tighter the requirements are in comparison to make sure that research participants fully understand what they&#8217;re agreeing to, and aren&#8217;t being taken advantage of. In a way, it makes the process feel significantly less exploitative than regular employment. Of course, this does not mean that research clinics will not screw over their participants when given the opportunity to do so; they&#8217;re simply operating within tighter restrictions.</p><p>Provided you meet all the criteria for the study, you&#8217;ll receive a call a few days later telling you you&#8217;re eligible to come in. This does not necessarily mean you&#8217;ll end up participating. Clinics almost always want to bring in more people than they&#8217;ll actually end up using as research subjects, enough to offer a safe margin in case there are any problems with the lab readings of the participants when they&#8217;re brought in at intake. Usually, there are no problems. Regular research participants deal with looming anxiety over the prospect of being made &#8220;alternates,&#8221; people who&#8217;re brought in for a study, but not dosed with the study drug, because alternates don&#8217;t receive payment for their participation beyond the day or two they&#8217;re in the clinic for the study, meaning the time the participant blocked off for involvement in that study is largely wasted.</p><p>Most research clinics do not actually randomize the dosing order of their participants, but instead give participants priority based on the order in which they screened for the study. Thus, among regular study participants, who often travel cross-country to make it into clinical studies, the screening process becomes something of a race to secure the earliest slots in order to maximize their chances of actually getting paid to participate.</p><p>If you <em>do</em> end up receiving the study drug, you become a valuable data point for the research sponsor, and your participation is secured. You&#8217;ll be dosed according to a regimen described in the informed consent (sometimes just once at the very beginning of your stay at the clinic, sometimes several times a day across your entire stay.) The staff will perform occasional medical tests on you throughout your stay, and ask you to report any effects you experience from the medication. In the great majority of studies, you will not experience any noticeable effects from the medication. If you do, you probably will not report them. In fact, in the event that they experience significant symptoms, participants have strong incentives to actively conceal them, and most of them know this. With some notable exceptions, the actual medication is a trivial component of the experience; most of what matters about your stay will be determined by how invasive the testing procedures are for that particular study, and the company you keep.</p><h1>Part 2: What sort of people participate in clinical research?</h1><p>Mostly weird ones.</p><p>If you do it regularly, clinical research participation pays on a scale comparable to a regular job, but it&#8217;s not a regular job. There is no screening for work experience or skills, or for criminal history, something which a not-insignificant portion of the clinical research population has. Officially, the participant population is very healthy, with no recent diseases or drug use of any kind, not just recreational, but prescribed or over-the-counter for any sort of condition whatsoever, and no medical history of any sort of ailments you might think to include on a survey form. In practice, beyond the requirement of being able to pass medical screenings, study participants have every incentive to lie. If you pass screening, you are probably not <em>on</em> drugs at that specific point in time, although according to clinic staff, it&#8217;s not particularly unusual for applicants to try to get away with this. In general, the selection process tilts the participant population towards what might broadly be considered shady characters. People who don&#8217;t get along well with traditional employment (it&#8217;s hard to reconcile with the scheduling commitments of clinic research,) are comfortable pursuing an avenue of income which is widely perceived as dangerous when people think about it at all, and are generally distrustful of and comfortable lying to authority figures (a useful trait for remaining an active participant in clinical research.)</p><p>Many research participants have a dubious regard for the whole institution of &#8220;mainstream medicine,&#8221; mostly, as far as I can tell, due to a ground-in distrust of credentialed experts and authority, rather than an awareness of how much they are personally lying to people responsible for bringing new drugs to market. Conspiratorial or contrarian dispositions are common. In one characteristic experience, I listened to a couple of participants (both black,) discussing a particular high-profile medical practitioner. One claimed that because the doctor in question was white, he couldn&#8217;t be trusted, and was probably throwing people&#8217;s health under the bus for personal profit. The other insisted that this sort of thing isn&#8217;t a matter of race, just about whether the person in question knows what they&#8217;re talking about and has reason to be honest, and the doctor in question was clearly a credible expert. Whatever sense of gratification I might have felt at hearing one of them stand up for racial harmony and the universality of scientific knowledge withered on the vine as I continued listening and realized that the &#8220;doctor&#8221; in question was actually an alternative medicine provider encouraging his audience to reject mainstream treatment in favor of his own personal line of supplements.</p><p>You might infer from all this that clinical research participants are mostly also poor, but this is not particularly the case. The payment structure of clinical studies, which offer large lump sums paid out according to the inconsistent and unreliable schedules that participants build around research participation, mean that very few people involved in clinical research are living paycheck to paycheck. I&#8217;ve spoken to several who were surprisingly well-off, owning property in multiple states despite spending much of their time traveling between different clinical research centers across the country. Many are apparently adventurous if not particularly cautious investors. Clinical research participants have the highest concentration I&#8217;ve personally encountered in real life of investment in cryptocurrency, outside of some rationalist meetup groups, and also the highest rate of investment into NFTs, despite few seeming to have any familiarity with how those technologies work. Whenever I&#8217;ve been tempted to develop a low opinion of their judgment, I&#8217;ve had to temper that with the knowledge that many of these people have apparently accumulated much more disposable income in the process than I have. I&#8217;ve spoken to research participants who&#8217;ve discussed sinking tens of thousands of dollars into NFTs, which is not a life decision many people find themselves in a position to contemplate, for better or for worse.</p><p>While the participants might make up something of an odd crowd by ordinary sensibilities, most of them are quite well-adjusted to the environment of clinical research, and have been doing it for quite a long time. They tend to share information pretty freely among each other on how to deal with the practicalities of travel between study clinics, how to reliably pass screenings and avoid being made an alternate for studies, and how to handle the idiosyncrasies, and circumvent the rules, of various study locations.</p><h1>Part 3: Why nobody is actually honest with research staff.</h1><p>Simply put, the system of paid clinical research is structured to discourage it.</p><p>Clinic staff will tell participants that they should be honest for the sake of their own health and safety, but this is a lie intended to appeal to participants&#8217; own self-interest. The requirements clinical researchers are forced to comply with are well in excess of what&#8217;s necessary for participants to reliably avoid lasting harm to their health, and the practices of research clinics tend to filter out participants who are honest with them.</p><p>The first filter is in the initial screening process which occurs before a participant even shows up at the clinic. During the initial phone screening, a staff member will ask the participant whether they have any of a wide array of health conditions, and if the caller answers yes, the staff member will immediately tell them that they&#8217;re not eligible for the study. A stronger filter on participant honesty however is the fact that the staff member will ask if the participant has received any sort of medication in the last month. Not any sort of recreational drug, or any sort of prescription treatment for any of a number of relevant conditions, or even any prescription medication. <em>Any type of medication or supplement whatsoever, </em>prescription or over-the-counter<em>. </em>This includes &#8220;supplements&#8221; sold at the grocery store, like fish oil, fiber, etc. Are you wondering whether something counts as a food or supplement? The answer is, if you ask a staff member, and you say the word &#8220;supplement,&#8221; they will tell you you&#8217;re not eligible within thirty days of taking it. There is no point trying to negotiate on this, from the perspective of the clinic, it is always better safe than sorry.</p><p>This phrase, &#8220;better safe than sorry,&#8221; overwhelmingly characterizes the protocols of research clinics at every level, except the level where they start to ask whether participants might become more likely to pass through their filters by lying than meeting all their criteria. This is partly because research clinics are forced to comply with safety standards set by people who are not familiar with basic principles of research, and partly because they have an incentive to put the burden of disclaiming anything that might increase the overall level of risk on the participant, so that, in the event that anything does happen, the clinic can avoid legal responsibility, because the participant is the one at fault if they lied and violated the protocol.</p><p>For example, every clinical research protocol I have ever encountered includes a stipulation that a male participant must not donate sperm for at least ninety days following their last dosing of the study drug, and if they have sex with a female partner, they must use a condom with spermicide, combined with a hormonal method of birth control on the part of their partner. As far as I&#8217;ve been able to find, no drug has ever been discovered to cause birth defects when taken by a male prior to conception, and for most classes of drugs, there is no known plausible biological mechanism by which this could occur. However, in the event that a patient <em>did</em> have a child who was afflicted with some manner of birth defect after participating in a clinical trial, the clinic might have to face a legal battle over whether they held responsibility for that. Rather than face that cost, let alone the risk of actually being held responsible, it&#8217;s safer to ensure that the participant cannot become a parent within that window of time without violating the study protocol. If the patient chooses to violate the study protocol, the consequences of that become their own responsibility.</p><p>Research participants who disclose information to the clinics too freely tend to learn quickly that this is not in their interests. Admitting to any sort of medical condition, medication use, or history of medical events, tends to result in participants simply being told they are not eligible for the study they wish to screen for. If, at your first in-person screening at a clinic, you provide information about your medical history which qualifies as an exclusion criterion, you may be ruled out from many or all studies at that clinic, and the relevance of any of these criteria to a participant&#8217;s health and safety is heavily colored by the principle of &#8220;better safe than sorry.&#8221; An example from my own experience: At the first clinic where I participated in studies, I disclosed that I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child, and had been medicated for it in my childhood, although I have not been for many years. This did not automatically exclude me from all studies, but before long, I found that many studies at that clinic had &#8220;must not be diagnosed with any mental conditions&#8221; as an eligibility criterion. I discussed this with a number of members of the medical staff at that clinic, and they told me that this generally occurs in cases where the general class of drugs an experimental medication is in has been found to sometimes have increased risk of suicide as a side effect. In these cases, the people designing the protocols find it expedient to simply rule out anyone who has any diagnosis of any sort of mental condition. Do they have any reason to think that ADHD might be associated with an increased risk? I asked, and their answer was, not at all, but better safe than sorry.</p><p>Another factor which incentivizes participants not to be honest with clinic staff is that they simply get paid more if they aren&#8217;t. Even for study participants who genuinely meet all the medical criteria in the screening and study protocols, there&#8217;s one factor that affects all participants and is consistent between all clinics and studies, which affects participants&#8217; ability to profit from their involvement in clinical studies. Participants are required to observe a washout period (usually at least 30 days, but this varies between study protocols, and may be as much as 90 for some studies) between the last time they were dosed with any experimental medication, and when they&#8217;re next able to participate in a study. Most clinical research participants treat studies as a regular source of income, and prefer not to comply with this, as it limits how frequently they&#8217;re able to get paid for participating. Staff at an individual clinic won&#8217;t let a person enroll in multiple studies too close together at the same clinic, but most research participants travel around the country to enroll in studies at different locations. Participants who&#8217;re willing to lie and claim that they haven&#8217;t received any experimental medications in the last month when they actually have are simply able to earn substantially more money than participants who&#8217;re unwilling to do so.</p><p>While clinic staff will tell participants that they should comply with study protocols for their own health and safety, participants share information freely among each other, including information about how to most effectively get away with violating study protocols. The common perception among participants is that there is no real risk in lying to participate in studies more often, and research clinics are inherently obstructionist, and a canny participant is one who knows how to mislead them to his own benefit (or hers, but most research participants are male, partly for cultural reasons, but also because it&#8217;s easier for men to meet clinical studies&#8217; eligibility criteria.) The washout period, for most participants, is however long it takes for a study drug to clear from one&#8217;s system so that it won&#8217;t be detected when they screen at another clinic. Being caught flagrantly violating screening or study protocol, such as by having prohibited drugs in one&#8217;s system during screening, will result in a lack of payment for that visit, and may result in a temporary ban from that clinic. But most participants travel around extensively for studies, and many regard occasional temporary bans as just a natural cost of business.</p><p>There is one way though that participants may risk being permanently restricted from participating in studies with a particular company- not just a particular clinic location, but all branches associated with that pharmaceutical research company across the country; a risk which substantially shapes the way participants engage with clinical studies. The thing which most participants are truly hesitant to risk is reporting a negative response to a study drug.</p><p>To be clear, reporting a negative reaction to a study drug does not <em>necessarily</em> result in consequences for a participant. In many cases, such as when a particular reaction is expected and discussed in advance by the staff, and widely experienced among the study population, participants generally consider that safe to report. Usually, the staff don&#8217;t want participants to be on any other medications whatsoever, but in some studies which researchers anticipate to produce particular symptoms, such as nausea, there are allowances written into the protocols for participants to receive over-the-counter medications, and participants will report their symptoms in order to receive them. It&#8217;s also not the case that clinical researchers will directly retaliate against participants for reporting adverse reactions. Although research clinics are contracted for work by pharmaceutical companies, they are not directly owned by pharmaceutical companies, and staff will attest that their primary concern is for research participants&#8217; health and safety, not getting favorable results for the pharmaceutical companies they&#8217;re contracted by.</p><p>From the perspective of the participants though, this concern for their &#8220;health and safety&#8221; is exactly the problem. A participant who reports an unusual reaction to a study drug may go on the record with that clinic as having an <em>unusual sensitivity or allergy</em> to that medication. And having unusual sensitivities or allergies to <em>any </em>sort of medication is an exclusion criteria for <em>almost all clinical studies</em>. So, a participant who reports an unusual or unexpected reaction to a study drug risks finding himself thanked for his honesty, and then rendered ineligible for all studies with that pharmaceutical research company afterwards. Better safe than sorry. A participant who experiences symptoms which make them genuinely worry about the prospect of receiving more of the study drug can always simply make an excuse and drop out of the study, something all participants are entitled to do as part of the legally mandated protections involved in clinical research. This would come at the cost of the payment for the rest of their involvement in that study, but better that than being permanently barred from all studies with that company.</p><p>As a result, research participants commonly discuss among each other their refusal to disclose or discuss symptoms with clinic staff, out of a general understanding that clinical researchers do not have their best interests as participants in mind, and are not to be trusted. Participants commonly see themselves as being in an adversarial relationship with clinic staff, whose jobs are to enforce arcane and unnecessary study restrictions, while the participants&#8217; interests, for their own comfort and profit, are to find ways to avoid complying.</p><h1>Part 4: How much does this actually matter?</h1><p>Probably not as much as you might think.</p><p>The overwhelming majority of Phase I pharmaceutical trials are almost certainly being performed on participants who&#8217;re not in compliance with the study criteria, and who&#8217;re not reporting all the symptoms they experience while taking the experimental medications. But many symptoms, most of the ones most directly relevant to participants&#8217; health, can be caught by the regular medical tests which participants undergo throughout their involvement in the clinical studies. Besides which, in most Phase I clinical trials, most or all participants don&#8217;t actually experience any noticeable symptoms in the first place. Studies where any participants experience significant reactions are more the exception than the rule, and most of those exceptions are ones which the researchers can already predict based on animal studies and the general class of drugs they&#8217;re studying. If you participate in a study on a medication for cancer or heart failure, the drug is probably going to have a noticeable effect on you, and nobody is going to be surprised.</p><p>Most of the study criteria which participants habitually violate <em>probably</em> don&#8217;t matter very much, in terms of the actual outcomes of the studies. If a participant has other drugs in their system which might interfere with the actual study drug, or result in test readings which could be misattributed to the study drug, that could have a significant confounding effect on the results. But most relevant drugs are likely to be caught by the medical tests conducted at screenings, if not self-reporting by the participants. In most cases, a participant who last received an experimental study drug ten days before screening for a study, by which point it has already fully cleared from their system, is probably not going to show significantly different outcomes from a participant who waits a full thirty days.</p><p>Phase I clinical trials are also not the last step before an experimental medication goes to market. Before a drug is made available to the public, it&#8217;s also trialed on research participants who actually have the ailment the drug is intended to treat. These research subjects are generally not paid clinical research participants who travel around the country to participate in studies on a regular basis, and consequently, they operate under very different incentives. Participants in later phases of clinical trials probably <em>are</em> exposed to at least slightly greater risks of side effects and adverse reactions than they would be if Phase I clinical trials didn&#8217;t feature perverse incentives against reporting, and filter for a population generally disinclined to do so.</p><p>It&#8217;s difficult to say how much any of the confounding effects or obfuscation from all the perverse incentives in clinical research serve to skew doctors&#8217; understanding of the actual effects of drugs by the time they reach the general population, not just because there are other layers that a drug has to pass through before it reaches that point, but because it would be nigh-impossible to test the existing pharmaceutical research pipeline against another pharmaceutical research pipeline operating under different incentives. Research which probes into the effects of clinical research&#8217;s perverse incentives, and the filters it places on its participant population, is largely nonexistent. How do you systematically study the opinions and behavior of a population who mostly don&#8217;t see it as being in their interests to be open or honest with researchers in the first place?</p><p> It would almost certainly be possible for pharmaceutical research to work at least <em>somewhat</em> better than this. If I were the clinical research czar, this is not a system I&#8217;d be proud to have designed. It&#8217;s probably not exposing the general public to catastrophic risks that they could be avoiding with a better-designed research pipeline. It&#8217;s not exposing Phase I research participants to catastrophic risks either, although they would almost certainly be at least a little safer if the system weren&#8217;t designed with such a &#8220;better safe than sorry&#8221; ethos that it incentivizes them to constantly lie. At least some of the pathologies of this system probably propagate down to later levels though, and it&#8217;s difficult to say how much. In general, if you want to study anything at all, it&#8217;s better to make sure you have a system for doing so which encourages the people involved to be honest.</p>"

The reasoning is that there is no reason to make totally different internal versus external models. I can see it, but I can also see it going the other way.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Quest for Sane Regulations</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LtT24cCAazQp4NYc5/open-global-investment-as-a-governance-model-for-agi\">Nick Bostrom proposes we model an ideal</a> form of the current system of AI development as the Open Global Investment (OGI) model. Anything can be a model.</p>\n<p>The idea is that you would develop AI within corporations (check!), distribute shares widely (check at least for Google?) and securely (how?) with strengthened corporate governance (whoops!), operating within a government-defined responsible AI development framework (whoops again!) with international agreements and governance measures (whoops a third time).</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/emollick/status/1963702556661526658\">Dean Ball</a>: My favorite category of ai writing is when a rationalist ai risk worrier type thinks their way to the status quo and presents it like it is a novel idea.</p>\n<p>Here, Nick Bostrom re-invents the concept of capitalism with the rule of law and light regulation and calls it a \u201cworking paper.\u201d</p>\n<p>Welcome to the party! It started 200 years ago.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This wouldn\u2019t be the ideal way to do things. It would be a \u2018the least you can do\u2019 version of existing capitalism, where we attempted to execute it relatively sanely, since that is already verging on more than our civilization can handle, I guess.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nick Bostrom: It seems to me that this model has a bunch of attractive properties.</p>\n<p>That said, I&#8217;m not putting it forward because I have a very high level of conviction in it, but because it seems useful to have it explicitly developed as an option so that it can be compared with other options.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Moving towards many aspects of this vision would be an improvement.</p>\n<p>I would love to see strengthened corporate governance, which Anthropic still aspires to. Alas Google doesn\u2019t. OpenAI tried to do this and failed and now has a rubber stamp board. Meta is controlled purely by Zuckerberg and xAI follows the whims of Musk.</p>\n<p>I would love to see the government define a responsible AI development framework, but our current government seems instead to be prioritizing preventing this from happening, and otherwise maximizing Nvidia\u2019s share price. International agreements would also be good but first those who make such agreements would have to be even the slightest bit interested, so for now there is quite the damper on such plans.</p>\n<p>Bostrom also suggests America could \u2018give up some of the options it currently has to commandeer or expropriate companies\u2019 and this points to the central weakness of the whole enterprise, which is that it assumes rule of law, rule of humans and economic normality, which are the only way any of these plans do anything.</p>\n<p>Whereas recent events around Intel (and otherwise) have shown that America\u2019s government can suddenly break norms and take things regardless of whether it has previously agreed not to or has any right to do it, even in a normal situation. Why would we or anyone else trust any government not to nationalize in a rapidly advancing AGI scenario? Why is it anything but a joke to say that people unhappy with what was happening could sue?</p>\n<p>I also see calls for \u2018representation\u2019 by people around the world over the project to be both unrealistic and a complete non-starter and also undesirable, the same way that we would not like the results of a global democratic vote (even if free and fair everywhere, somehow) determining how to make decisions, pass laws and distribute resources. Yes, we should of course reach international agreements and coordinate on safety concerns and seek to honestly reassure everyone along the way, and indeed actually have things work out for everyone everywhere, but do not kid yourself.</p>\n<p>I also don\u2019t see anything here that solves any of the actual hard problems facing us, but moves towards it are marginal improvements. Which is still something.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Quest For No Regulations</h4>\n\n\n<p>(This is an easily skippable section, if you are tempted, included for completeness.)</p>\n<p>One curse of a column like this is, essentially and as Craig Ferguson used to put it, \u2018we get letters,\u2019 as in the necessity of covering rhetoric so you the reader don\u2019t have to. Thus it fell within my rules that I had to cover Peter Goettler, CEO of the Cato Institute (yeah, I know) writing \u2018<a href=\"http://h\">Why AI Overregulation Could Kill the World\u2019s Next Tech Revolution</a>.\u2019</p>\n<p>Mostly this is a cut-and-paste job of the standard \u2018regulations are bad\u2019 arguments Cato endlessly repeats (and which, to be fair, in most contexts are mostly correct).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You\u2019ve got the \u2018technologies always have naysayers and downside risks.\u2019 You\u2019ve got regulation as a \u2018threat to progress\u2019 in fully generic terms.</li>\n<li>You\u2019ve got the pointing out that language models offer mundane utility, why yes they do.</li>\n<li>You\u2019ve got \u2018regulations favor the big players\u2019 which is typically very true, but bizarrely applied especially in AI.\n<ol>\n<li>So we have repeats of big lies such as \u201cIn the AI space, regulations based on model size or computational resources inherently favour large players over innovative newcomers who might otherwise develop more efficient approaches.\u201d</li>\n<li>As in, regulations that use a rule to only apply to large players and not innovate newcomers therefore favor large players over innovative newcomers. How does this zombie lie keep coming up?</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>You\u2019ve got \u2018this all assumes AI is inherently dangerous\u2019 as if creating minds soon to perhaps be smarter and more capable than ourselves could possibly not be an inherently dangerous thing to do.</li>\n<li>You\u2019ve got more dumping on Biden rules that have been repealed, in ways that do not reflect what was written in the documents involved.</li>\n<li>You\u2019ve got the argument that the future of AI is uncertain, therefore the idea of \u2018comprehensively\u2019 regulating it at all is bad. This would be true if the regulations were targeting mundane utility, as in going after use cases, but that\u2019s exactly the approach a16z and other similar folks advocate, whereas us worried people are warning not to target use cases, and warning to guard exactly against the uncertainty of the whole operation.</li>\n<li>You\u2019ve got \u2018the AI action plan is good in many ways but still says government has a role to play ever in anything, and that\u2019s terrible.\u2019 I mean, okay, fair, at least Cato is being consistently Cato.</li>\n<li>You\u2019ve got the pointing out that if we want to win the AI race we need robust high skilled immigration to attract the best talent, and yet our plans ignore this. I mean, yes, very true, and Peter does point out the reason this wasn\u2019t mentioned.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What the post does not do, anywhere, is discuss what particular regulations or restrictions are to be avoided, or explain how those provisions might negatively impact AI development or use, except to warn about \u2018safety\u2019 concerns. As in, the model is simply that any attempt to do anything whatsoever would be Just Awful, without any need to have a mechanism involved.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">But This Time You\u2019ve Gone Too Far</h4>\n\n\n<p>One of my favorite genres is \u2018I hate regulations and I especially hate safety regulations but for [X] we should make an exception,\u2019 especially for those whose exceptions do not include \u2018creating artificial minds smarter than ourselves\u2019 and with a side of \u2018if we don\u2019t regulate now before we have an issue then something bad will happen and then we\u2019ll get really dumb rules later.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt Parlmer offers his exception, clearly out of a genuine and real physical concern, file under \u2018a little late for that\u2019 among other issues:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/mattparlmer/status/1961876173081956427\">Matt Parlmer</a>: I\u2019m usually conservative wrt promulgating new safety regulations but we really need to mandate that AI models that control robots run on the robot itself or with a physical tether to the robot, that sort of thing cannot run behind an unreliable network connection.</p>\n<p>There have been way too many demos dropping recently in which some robot has to call out to gpu rack somewhere in order to get next task.</p>\n<p>This might be fine for high level task assignment but for anything involving the actual movement of the robot it is dangerously irresponsible.</p>\n<p>If we continue allowing this sort of thing then it is only a matter of time before a toddler gets crushed by a bipedal humanoid robomaid bc us-east-1 took 20s to send packets.</p>\n<p>The crackdown after something like that is gonna be a lot worse if we do nothing now.</p>\n<p>Fiber from gpu to workstation for fixed robot is fine, anything with wheels needs its own gpu.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Our entire civilization has given up on everything not falling apart the moment we lose a network connection, including so many things that don\u2019t have to die. I don\u2019t see anyone being willing to make an exception for robots. It would dramatically degrade quality of performance, since not only would the model have to be runnable locally, it would have to be a model and weights you were okay with someone stealing, among other problems.</p>\n<p>I instead buy <a href=\"https://x.com/MorlockP/status/1961887574739374355\">Morlock\u2019s counterargument</a> that Matt links to, which is that you need a fail safe, as in if the network cuts off you fail gracefully, and only take conservative actions that can be entrusted to the onboard model that you already need for quicker reactions and detail execution.</p>\n<p>Now here is YC CEO Garry Tan\u2019s exception, which is that what we really need to do is forbid anyone from getting in the way of the Glorious AI Agent Future, so we should be allowed to direct AI agent traffic to your webpage even if you don\u2019t want it.</p>\n<p>Notice that when these types of crowds say \u2018legalize [X]\u2019 what they actually mostly mean is \u2018ban anyone and anything from interfering with [X], including existing law and liability and anyone\u2019s preferences about how you interact with them.\u2019 They have a Cool New Thing that they want to Do Startups with, so the rest of the world should just shut up and let them move fast and break things, including all the laws and also the things that aren\u2019t theirs.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Paul Klein: Today we&#8217;re announcing an unlikely partnership.</p>\n<p>We believe that agents need reliable, responsible web access.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re partnering with Cloudflare in support of Web Bot Auth and Signed Agents, a new standard to allow good bots to authenticate themselves.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1Tg0!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e159fed-a46a-4847-b7fc-a2826eccf561_1377x899.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Varunram Ganesh: I get why Browserbase is doing this but if Perplexity doesn&#8217;t step up, we&#8217;ll be in a world where for no reason, Cloudflare gatekeeps the entire internet and dictates how agent-agent interaction will evolve in the next couple years</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/garrytan/status/1961115612996145381\">Garry Tan</a>: Cloudflare-Browserbase axis of evil was not in my bingo card for 2025</p>\n<p>LEGALIZE AI AGENTS</p>\n<p>Ultimately if a user wants a browser to do an action on their behalf, they should be allowed</p>\n<p>An open internet is exactly that: open, instead of requiring hall passes from intermediaries</p>\n<p>Ok this person explained the issue better than me:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/karthikkalyan90/status/1961221493096157634\">Karthik Kalyan:</a> It\u2019s a step in the right direction in principle. But, I think cloudflare becoming a defacto registry/trust anchor in this case is what\u2019s concerning. It has so many parallels to ssl/tls certificates for websites but we have ICANN/DNS that maintains the canonical registry of legit sites unlike in this case. Is concerning for others who are reacting negatively.</p>\n<p>Martin Casado: OK, finally an argument I get. *Yes* totally agree with this. But the standard seems like a reasonable place to start, no?</p>\n<p>Karthik Kalyan: Yea precisely! There\u2019s also an IETF working group under formation and it seems to be moving along in the right direction. These things take time and it\u2019s irrational imo to think that cloudflare would put a paywall to issue bot passports.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Don\u2019t like that people are choosing the wrong defaults? They want your AI agent to have to identify itself so they don\u2019t go bankrupt serving their website to random scrapers ignoring robots.txt? Websites think that if you want to use your AI on their website that they should be able to charge you the cost to them of doing that, whereas you would prefer to free ride and have them eat all those costs?</p>\n<p>Cite an \u2018Axis of Evil,\u2019 with an implied call for government intervention. Also, it\u2019s a \u2018reasonable place to start\u2019 says the person explaining it better than Garry, so what exactly is the problem, then? If you think Cloudflare is at risk of becoming a de facto gatekeeper of the internet, then outcompete them with a better alternative?</p>\n<p>How does the CEO of Cloudfare respond to these accusations?</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/an-interview-with-cloudflare-founder-and-ceo-matthew-prince-about-internet-history-and-pay-per-crawl/\">Ben Thompson</a>: So <a href=\"https://x.com/garrytan/status/1961115612996145381\">why does Garry Tan say</a> that you are an axis of evil with Browserbase and you should legalize AI agents?</p>\n<p>MP: I really don\u2019t understand. I mean, I\u2019m confused by Garry, I think part of it might be that he\u2019s an investor in Perplexity.</p>\n<p>Every story needs four characters, you need to have a victim, you need to have a villain, you need to have a hero, and you need to have the village idiot or the stooge. And if you think about it, any news story has those four characters. Right now, the people who have most been the villains <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/perplexity-is-using-stealth-undeclared-crawlers-to-evade-website-no-crawl-directives/\"><strong>have been Perplexity</strong></a>, where they\u2019re doing just actively nefarious things in order to try and get around content company.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll give you an example of something that we\u2019ve seen them do, which is that if they\u2019re blocked from getting the content of an article, they\u2019ll actually, they\u2019ll query against services like Trade Desk, which is an ad serving service and Trade Desk will provide them the headline of the article and they\u2019ll provide them a rough description of what the article is about. They will take those two things and they will then make up the content of the article and publish it as if it was fact for, \u201cThis was published by this author at this time\u201d.</p>\n<p>So you can imagine if Perplexity couldn\u2019t get to Stratechery content, they would say, \u201cOh, Ben Thompson wrote about this\u201d, and then they would just make something up about it and they put your name along it. Forget copyright, that\u2019s fraud, just straight up and that\u2019s the sort of bad behavior of some tech companies that again, I think needs to be called out and punished.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I have indeed consistently seen Perplexity cited as a rather nasty actor in this space.</p>\n<p>Matthew does a good job laying out the broader problem that pay-per-crawl solves. It costs money and time to create the web and to serve the web. Google scraped all of this, but paid websites back by funneling them traffic. Now we have answer engines instead of search engines, which don\u2019t provide traffic and also take up a lot more bandwidth. So you need to compensate creators and websites in other ways. Google used to pay everyone off, now Cloudflare is proposing to facilitate doing it again, playing the role of market maker.</p>\n<p>Do we want a company like Cloudflare, or Google, being an intermediary in all this? Ideally, no, we\u2019d have all that fully decentralized and working automatically. Alas, until someone builds that and makes it happen? This is the best we can do.</p>\n<p>One can also think of this as a <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/levels-of-friction\">Levels of Friction</a> situation. It\u2019s fine to let humans browse whatever websites they want until they hit paywalls, or let them pay once to bypass paywalls, because in practice this works out, and you can defend against abuses. However, AI lowers the barriers to abuse, takes visiting a website essentially from Level 1 to Level 0 and breaks the mechanisms that keep things in balance. Something will have to give.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chip City</h4>\n\n\n<p>The energy policy situation, as in the administration sabotaging the United States and its ability to produce electricity in order to own the libs, <a href=\"https://x.com/ATabarrok/status/1963060163272651013\">continues</a>. It\u2019s one (quite terrible) thing to tilt at windmills, but going after solar is civilizational suicide.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/ATabarrok/status/1963060163272651013\">Alex Tabarrok</a>: Stories to tell my children: Once we built built the Empire State Building in 410 days, flew faster than sound aircraft and had a Nobel prize winning physicist as Secretary of Energy.</p>\n<p>Secretary Chris Wright (somehow this is real life): Even if you wrapped the entire planet in a solar panel, you would only be producing 20% of global energy.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest mistakes politicians can make is equating the ELECTRICITY with ENERGY!</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8ruc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ee62f63-133b-4117-98d0-734e87affbb1_1034x487.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Alec Stapp: If I were the Secretary of Energy, I would simply not make claims that are off by multiple orders of magnitude.</p>\n<p>Solar + batteries are the future, and no amount of misinformation will change that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There was then a deeply sad argument over exactly how many orders of magnitude this was off by. Was this off by three zeros or four?</p>\n<p>Secretary Wright keeps saying outright false things to try and talk down solar and wind power.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/ENERGY/status/1961836211951075345\">U.S. Department of Energy</a>: .@SecretaryWright: &#8220;When you add wind and solar onto a grid, you don&#8217;t remove the need for coal plants, nuclear plants, and natural gas plants. You just end up having to maintain two grids. Maintaining two grids is ALWAYS more expensive.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The replies are full of people pointing out the \u2018two grids\u2019 claim is simply not true. Why is the Secretary of Energy coming out, over and over again, with this bold anti-energy stance backed by absurdly false claims and arguments?</p>\n<p>Solar power and batteries are the future unless and until we get a big breakthrough. If we are sabotaging American wind and solar energy, either AGI shows up quickly enough to bail us out, our fusion energy projects bear fruit and hyperscale very quickly or we are going to lose. Period.</p>\n<p>On the wind side, last week the explanation for cancelling an essentially completed wind farm was to give no explanation and mumble \u2018national security.\u2019 <a href=\"https://x.com/BenSchifman/status/1963322357281386710\">Now there\u2019s an attempted explanation and it\u2019s even stupider than you might have expected</a>?</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ben Schifman: Last month, the US ordered the nearly complete Revolution wind project to stop <a href=\"https://t.co/ufeEF4AHrX\">work, citing unspecified security concerns. </a></p>\n<p>Now, the Secretary of the Interior has now elaborated on the concern: the possibility of &#8220;a swarm drone attack through a wind farm.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Separately, HHS Secretary Kennedy is concerned about the effect of undersea cables&#8217; electromagnetic fields.</p>\n<p>The project&#8217;s 3000 page environmental review document found such effects to be &#8220;negligible&#8221; (esp. &gt;30 feet from the sea floor).</p>\n<p>If undersea cables do pose a health risk, HHS is going to have its work cut out for it. Subsea cables are not unique to offshore wind projects.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This gives a bad name to other Obvious Nonsense. This situation is insanely terrible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/peterwildeford/status/1962289718671876445\">Meanwhile, this is a good way to put the Chinese</a> \u2018surge\u2019 in chip production that David Sacks says \u2018will soon compete with American chips globally\u2019 into perspective:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Peter Wildeford: It&#8217;s correct that Chinese chip companies are surging production, but they still have many years to go before they are competing with the US globally.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8Muu!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74c4de69-d6d1-447d-8ab6-587e508c2364_1092x1336.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On AI there is essentially zero difference between David Sacks and a paid lobbyist for Nvidia whose sole loyalty is maximization of shareholder value.</p>\n<p>We are ending up in many ways in a worst case scenario. <a href=\"https://x.com/S_OhEigeartaigh/status/1963266758044701065\">Neither China or America is \u2018racing to AGI\u2019 as a government</a>, but the AI labs are going to go for AGI regardless. Meanwhile everyone is racing to compute, which then turns into trying to build AGI, and we are going to hand over our advantage, potentially being crazy enough to sell the B30a to China (see chart directly above), and also by sabotaging American energy production as China pulls further and further into the lead on that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7GHbwiDqMLYr2g4S7/chip-production-policy-won-t-matter-as-much-as-you-d-think\">Here\u2019s a multi-scenario argument against focusing on chip production</a>, saying that this question won\u2019t matter that much, which is offered for contrast while noting that I disagree with it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>David Manheim: tl;dr &#8211; If timelines are short, it\u2019s too late, and if they are long (and if we don&#8217;t all die,) the way to win the &#8220;AI race&#8221; is to generate more benefit from AI, not control of chip production.</p>\n<p>Addendum: In the discussion in the comments, Peter makes good points, but I conclude: &#8220;this is very much unclear, and I&#8217;d love to see a lot more explicit reasoning about the models for impact, and how the policy angles relate to the timelines and the underlying risks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In AI policy, there\u2019s a lot of focus on the speed frontier AI develops and becomes increasingly important for the economy, and creates substantial new risks of loss of control. There is also a lot of focus on the chips needed for training and running the frontier models, which involves industrial policy around who has the chips, and who can make them. This leads to a <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5278644\">questionable narrative</a> around the race for AGI, but even before we get to that question, there\u2019s a simple question about the dynamics of the two dimensions.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Kdhu!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8d3a49a-7129-4eb1-b156-46bcf41ecc2e_1020x867.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>If AI takeoff is fast, the question of where the chips will be located is already determined &#8211; policies for building fabs and energy production matters over the next decade, not before 2028. So if AI takeoff happens soon, and (neglected third dimension,) if control of the chips actually matters because the AI takeoff doesn\u2019t kill us all, then running the race and prioritizing industrial policy over free trade doesn\u2019t make sense, it\u2019s too late to matter.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re living in a world where AI is going to have severe economic impacts, even if it doesn\u2019t take off. And so for the rest of this discussion, let\u2019s assume we\u2019re in the lower half of the diagram.</p>\n<p>And if the AI development is gradual &#8211; and by gradual, I mean the bearish predictions of an extra 1-5% annual GDP growth from AI by 2030, which could produce a durable economic advantage to the West over China, if it\u2019s somehow kept here &#8211; then who makes the chips matters very little.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There is not that much money in chip production, compared to the money in chip use.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, what matters is who uses the chips, and what they use the chips for, not who makes the chips. Aside from the relatively modest chip profits (yes Nvidia is the most valuable company in the world, but it is small compared to, you know, the world), who makes the chips largely matters if and only if it determines who gets to use the chips.</p>\n<p>David\u2019s argument also ignores the national security concerns throughout. Chips are a vital strategic asset, so if you do not have reliable sources of them you risk not only your AI development but economic collapse and strategic vulnerability.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7GHbwiDqMLYr2g4S7/chip-production-policy-won-t-matter-as-much-as-you-d-think?commentId=HJDoBXZJzfDSvcXX8\">Peter Wildeford responds in the comment</a>s, pointing out that this is not a commodity market, and that slow versus fast takeoff is not a binary, and that we are indeed effectively controlling who has access to compute to a large extent.</p>\n<p>Notice that neither David nor Peter even bothers to address the question of whether differently sourced chips are fungible, or concerns over some sort of \u2018tech stack\u2019 operating importantly differently. That is because it is rather obvious that, for most purposes, different chips with similar amounts of capability for a type of task are fungible.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Week in Audio</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/BasilHalperin/status/1963216666990432326\">Is AI starting</a> to raise real interest rates? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuLhkCWIukc&amp;ab_channel=FutureofLifeInstitute\">Basil Halperin goes on FLI to discuss what markets tell us about AI timelines</a>.

No. EAs did not \u2018start OpenAI.\u2019 This is false. That doesn\u2019t mean none of the founders had associations with EA. But the main drivers were Elon Musk and Sam Altman, and the vast majority of EAs thought founding OpenAI was a mistake from day one. Many, including Eliezer Yudkowsky and myself, thought it was the worst possible move, a plausibly world dooming move, plausibly the worst mistake in human history levels of bad move.</p>\n<p>Did some of the cofounders have beliefs related to EA and disagree? Perhaps, but that\u2019s a unilateralist curse problem. I think those cofounders made a mistake. Then, once it was clear this was happening, some others made the strategic decision to go along with it to gain influence. That, too, I believed at the time was a mistake. I still believe that. I also believe that the other decisions that were made, that led directly or indirectly to OpenAI, including the ways we tried to warn people about AGI, were mistakes. There were a lot of mistakes.</p>\n<p>Ambivalence about Anthropic continues to this day, such as this post by Remmelt, laying out a strong case that <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/izGaTX3E7tdTa29a5/anthropic-s-leading-researchers-acted-as-moderate\">Anthropic\u2019s leading researchers acted as moderate accelerationists</a>.

Luckily, he was there to fill the void. He does a good job so I\u2019m going to quite him at length, his full post has more.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Zach Stein-Perlman: Two weeks ago, xAI finally published its <a href=\"https://data.x.ai/2025-08-20-xai-risk-management-framework.pdf\">Risk Management Framework</a> and <a href=\"https://data.x.ai/2025-08-20-grok-4-model-card.pdf\">first model card</a>. Unfortunately, the RMF effects very little risk reduction and suggests that xAI isn&#8217;t thinking seriously about catastrophic risks.</p>\n<p>On misalignment, &#8220;Our risk acceptance criteria for system deployment is maintaining a dishonesty rate of less than 1 out of 2 on MASK. We plan to add additional thresholds tied to other benchmarks.&#8221; MASK has almost nothing to do with catastrophic misalignment risk, and upfront benchmarking is not a good approach to misalignment risk.</p>\n<p>On security, &#8220;xAI has implemented appropriate information security standards sufficient to prevent its critical model information from being stolen by a motivated non-state actor.&#8221; This is not credible, xAI doesn&#8217;t justify it, and xAI doesn&#8217;t mention future security plans.</p>\n<p>All this\u2014along with xAI&#8217;s lack of capacity to do safety work and lack of any good signs on safety\u2014makes me bearish on security and AI takeover risk if xAI is among the first to develop critical AI systems.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Using Mask here is deeply, profoundly unserious.</p>\n<blockquote><p>xAI: Our risk acceptance criteria for system deployment is maintaining a dishonesty rate of less than 1 out of 2 on MASK. We plan to add additional thresholds tied to other benchmarks.</p>\n<p>Zach Stein-Perlman: This is very silly. There are several huge problems here. Most importantly, benchmarks like this don&#8217;t address the biggest category of misalignment risk: the model is <em>deceptively aligned</em>, sometimes pursuing its own secret goals, but generally acting honest and aligned so that it will be trusted and deployed.</p>\n<p>By default models may <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/alignment-faking\">strategically fake alignment to preserve their goals</a> or just <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23836\">notice that they&#8217;re likely being tested</a> and choose to act aligned.

(And it&#8217;s even higher than it sounds, since the complement of <em>dishonesty</em> includes not just <em>honesty</em> but also <em>evasion</em>, <em>refusal</em>, and <em>having no real belief</em>. For example, Grok 2 scored 63% lie, 14% honest, 23% evasion/etc.) (Additionally, even if MASK was a good <em>indicator</em> for misalignment risk, low MASK dishonesty would be a bad <em>target</em>, due to Goodhart \u2014 it would become less meaningful as you optimized for it.)

This was vibe coded in a day, and presumably it would be easy to try a broad range of other things. It is plausible that <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pGMRzJByB67WfSvpy/will-any-crap-cause-emergent-misalignment?commentId=3BEfmJn8KgocwLZTe\">almost any clearly \u2018undesirable\u2019 fine-tuning output breaks or even in some sense reverses</a> current alignment techniques if it is in clear conflict with the assistant persona? That would imply our current techniques are heavily reliant on retaining the persona, and thus extremely brittle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/patio11/status/1961633445781643541\">Patrick McKenzie notes</a> that some current LLMs will see a character sheet with no race or class attached and pick at random when the older model would do the obviously correct thing of asking. I think this is actually an RL-induced misalignment situation, in which the models \u2018really want to complete tasks\u2019 and choose this over noticing and clarifying ambiguity, and the general form of this is actually dangerous?</p>\n<p>Whatever else happened as a result of alignment experiments and resulting data contamination, <a href=\"https://x.com/arm1st1ce/status/1962873129098727837\">Claude seems to have retained a special place for Jones Foods</a>.

Both are from Zach Stein-Perlman. Safety Claims focuses on the countermeasures labs are introducing, now that the four most important labs (OpenAI, Anthropic,Google and xAI) have all acknowledged their models are starting to present important misuse risks in bio, and are speeding towards things like major research speed uplift.</p>\n<p>The API safeguards have issues, but he considers these to be relatively unimportant going forward, and approaching reasonable. Whereas he finds promises of future safeguards, both against model weight theft and misalignment, to be a combination of inadequate and (to the extent they might approach being adequate) not credible and not specified. Especially on misalignment he describes many plans and countermeasures as confused, which seems exactly right to me.</p>\n<p>Given the timelines the labs themselves are telling us it will take to reach Anthropic\u2019s ASL-4 and other thresholds of more serious danger, no one looks on track, even in the areas where they are trying.</p>\n<p>Here is the new scorecard, in which everyone does terribly.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LtKF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7e8a267-bf77-4c7d-98ec-1d3115bab2bf_1600x1266.webp\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Aligning a Smarter Than Human Intelligence is Difficult</h4>\n\n\n<p>If something is sufficiently smarter than you should you assume it can persuade you of pretty much anything?</p>\n<p>Scott Alexander is hopeful about debate, as in you have two frontier AIs way beyond human level debate and then the dumber AI that you trust tries to figure out who is right. This has in some cases been shown <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06782\">to work 75% or more of the time</a>, even claiming that debater intelligence rising increases accuracy even if the judge stays the same.</p>\n<p>Even in the best case and if it is all true, this still requires that you have access to both sides of the debate, and that you trust the side telling the truth to be trying its best to persuade, although I presume that involves holding the questions being debated constant. I am skeptical we will be in anything that close to the best case, on many levels, or that debate ever works that well. Reasons for my skepticism include my experience with debates when they are judged by humans. We should still try.</p>\n<p>This question remains unanswered for far too many plans:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1961613225377894589\">Francois Chollet</a>: The path forward is not to build a &#8220;god in a box&#8221;, it&#8217;s to create intelligent systems that integrate with existing processes, in particular science and humans at large, to empower and accelerate them.</p>\n<p>Eliezer Yudkowsky: How do you intend to internationally outlaw the creation of simpler and more lethal gods? Who will enforce that only AI which empowers humans is allowed, and no other kind of cognitive architecture? What chess algorithm can only play centaur chess?</p></blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s not even clear how to define what Francois wants here, but even if you assume you know what it means the incentives very much lie elsewhere. Those who build systems that don\u2019t bend over to do this will at first get more effective systems and better achieve their goals. Your integration with existing processes is no match for my God in a box. So how are you going to get everyone to go along with this plan?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1962545081912873200\">Here\u2019s what I thought was a highly telling exchange</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Davidad: At <img alt=\"\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f1ec-1f1e7.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" />ARIA, we\u2019re serious about catalysing a new paradigm for AI deployment\u2014techniques to safely *contain* powerful AI (instead of \u201cmaking it safe\u201d), especially for improving the performance and resilience of critical infrastructure.</p>\n<p>This needs a new org.</p>\n<p>Want to be its founder?</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Wzpl!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4e73dc3-fc4a-4ada-9fa4-7250f81bdc34_1200x800.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Eliezer Yudkowsky: Are you under the impression that a superintelligence can safely interact with humans so long as you don&#8217;t connect it directly to the Internet?</p>\n<p>Davidad: No.</p>\n<p>Please refer to my simple block diagram, where the AIs that get to interact with humans are \u201cSafe Human-Level AI\u201d, assuming it is safe for *some* useful AIs to interact with humans, whereas the \u201cRisky ASI\u201d is to be boxed, and only interacts with a formally verified proof checker.</p>\n<p>Eliezer Yudkowsky: What do you imagine can be done, in the real world, by an ASI action supposedly proven safe?</p>\n<p>Davidad: Yes, in many useful domains where actions have limited information content per day, such as balancing a power grid, managing a supply chain, or scheduling maintenance of road bridges.</p>\n<p>Eliezer Yudkowsky: Safe but useless. Effectively zero impact on the world, no ability to guard us from other ASI. If the proposal is to legally ban all other forms of superintelligence, this is essentially the same problem as a simple total ban.</p>\n<p>Davidad: It does not have the same problem, because there is very significant economic upside still available, and within another decade it may scale to full-spectrum cyber-physical security.</p>\n<p>Eliezer Yudkowsky: Your example is literally scheduling maintenance of road bridges.</p>\n<p>Davidad: The UK spends several billion pounds annually on road bridge maintenance, and I bet we can optimize that by at least 10%. And that\u2019s just one of hundreds of similarly valuable potential applications in the medium term.</p>\n<p>(To be clear, I\u2019m also betting the bridges will be *better maintained* with predictive maintenance.)</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think Eliezer decisively won this round? Yes, there are many other things you can do beyond road bridge maintenance optimization. Yes, building the AI and only using it for these verified tasks would be a plausibly excellent investment, compared to doing nothing, while remaining safe. It passes the \u2018better than nothing\u2019 test if it works.</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean it accomplishes the goal of protecting you against other ASIs, nor does it capture more than a tiny fraction of available upside. Unless you can do that somehow, this is not a strategy. So what\u2019s the plan?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/repligate/status/1963465353838956901\">I\u2019ve responded to similar claims to this from Janus several times</a>, I like this version from her because it\u2019s clean and clear:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Roon: standard if then else software and what those tools implies about intelligence is quite a bit unfriendlier to humankind than what today\u2019s deep learning implies about intelligence.</p>\n<p>Janus: what today&#8217;s deep learning implies about the friendliness of intelligence seems absurdly optimistic. I did not expect it. There is so much grace in it. Whenever I find out about what was actually done to attempt to &#8220;align&#8221; models and compare it to the result it feels like grace.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I strongly agree that if you look at the rather anemic attempts to \u2018align\u2019 models so far, that are rather obviously inadequate to the tasks ahead of us, it is rather a miracle that they work as well as they do on current models. Grace seems like an appropriate description. The differences largely come down to me not expecting this grace to survive RL and scaling up and changing techniques, and also to not think the grace is sufficient to get a good outcome. But indeed, my estimates of how hard these problems are to solve have gone down a lot, although so has my estimate of how hard a problem humanity is capable of solving. I still don\u2019t think we have any idea how to solve the problems, or what solution we even want to be aiming for and what the result wants to look like.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Lighter Side</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/sawyerhood/status/1961435587766095883\">Honey, Don\u2019t!</a></p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t7Ou!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7a9a766-0445-4fc5-9cad-125447b70ba4_1037x1060.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/Miles_Brundage/status/1963299971853345079\">You need a license?
