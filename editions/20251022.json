                "<p>I had syntax highlighting in the very first version of this blog, and I never really thought about that decision.\nI was writing a programming blog, and I was including snippets of code, so <em>obviously</em> I should have syntax highlighting.</p>\n\n<p>Over the next thirteen years, I tweaked and refined the rest of the design, but I never touched the syntax highlighting.\nI\u2019ve been applying a rainbow wash of colours that <a href=\"https://pygments.org/styles/#default\">somebody else chose</a>, because I didn\u2019t have any better ideas.</p>\n\n<p>This week I read Nikita Prokopov\u2019s article <a href=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/\">Everyone is getting syntax highlighting wrong</a>, which advocates for a more restrained approach.\nRather than giving everything a colour, he suggests colouring just a few key elements, like strings, comments, and variable definitions.\nI don\u2019t know if that would work for everybody, but I like the idea, and it gave me the push to try something new.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s time to give code snippets the same care I\u2019ve given the rest of this site.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"table_of_contents\">\n  <h3>Table of contents</h3>\n\n  <ul>\n    \n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2025/syntax-highlighting/#what-have-i-changed\">What have I changed?</a>\n\n        \n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2025/syntax-highlighting/#how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</a>\n\n        \n          <ul>\n            \n            <li><a href=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2025/syntax-highlighting/#converting-code-to-html\">Converting code to HTML</a></li>\n            \n            <li><a href=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2025/syntax-highlighting/#separating-variablefunction-definitions-and-usage\">Separating variable/function definitions and usage</a></li>\n            \n          </ul>\n        \n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2025/syntax-highlighting/#what-do-i-like-about-this-new-design\">What do I like about this new design?</a>\n\n        \n          <ul>\n            \n            <li><a href=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2025/syntax-highlighting/#its-pushed-me-to-think-more-about-syntax-highlighting\">It\u2019s pushed me to think more about syntax highlighting</a></li>\n            \n            <li><a href=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2025/syntax-highlighting/#it-makes-comments-more-prominent\">It makes comments more prominent</a></li>\n            \n            <li><a href=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2025/syntax-highlighting/#it-might-be-easier-to-read\">It might be easier to read</a></li>\n            \n          </ul>\n        \n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2025/syntax-highlighting/#better-late-than-never\">Better late than never</a>\n\n        \n      </li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-have-i-changed\">What have I changed?</h2>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve stripped back the syntax highlighting to a few key rules:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Comments in red</li>\n  <li>Strings in green</li>\n  <li>Numbers, booleans, and other constants in magenta</li>\n  <li>Variable definitions in blue</li>\n  <li>Punctuation in grey</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Everything else is the default black/white.</p>\n\n<p>This is similar to Nikita\u2019s colour scheme \u201cAlabaster\u201d, but I chose my own colours to match my site palette.\nI\u2019m also making my own choices about how to interpret these rules, because real code doesn\u2019t always fall into neat buckets.</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a snippet of Rust code with the old syntax highlighting:</p>\n\n<source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" type=\"image/png\" /><source type=\"image/png\" /><img alt=\"Screenshot of some Rust code. Most of the code is coloured either blue, red, or green, with some bold and italicised text. The one comment is in a dull bluish-grey.\" class=\"screenshot dark_aware\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2025/old_code1_1x.png\" width=\"626\" />\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the same code in my new design:</p>\n\n<source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" type=\"image/png\" /><source type=\"image/png\" /><img alt=\"Screenshot of the same Rust code. Now the code is mostly black, with blue highlights for the import/function/variable name, strings in green, and the comment is bright red.\" class=\"screenshot dark_aware\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2025/new_code1_1x.png\" width=\"626\" />\n\n\n<p>Naturally, these code blocks work in both light and dark mode.</p>\n\n<p>The new design is cleaner, it fits in better with the rest of the site, and I really like it.\nSome of that will be novelty and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikea_Effect\">IKEA effect</a>, but I see other benefits to this simplified palette.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"converting-code-to-html\">Converting code to HTML</h3>\n\n<p>I use <a href=\"https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge\">Rouge</a> as my syntax highlighter.\nI give it a chunk of code and <a href=\"https://rouge-ruby.github.io/docs/file.Languages.html\">specify the language</a>, and it parses the code into a sequence of tokens \u2013 like operators, variables, or constants.\nRouge returns a blob of HTML, with each token wrapped in a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> that describes the token type.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if I ask Rouge to highlight the Python snippet:</p>\n<pre><code>print(\"hello world\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>it produces this HTML:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code><span class=\"nt\">&lt;span</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"nf\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>print<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"p\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>(<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"sh\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\"<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"s\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>hello world<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"sh\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\"<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"p\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>)<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/span&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first token is <code>print</code>, which is a function name (<code>Name.Function</code>, or <code>class=\"nf\"</code>).\nThe <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> are punctuation (<code>\"p\"</code>) and the string is split into quotation marks (<code>sh</code> for <code>String.Heredoc</code>) and the text (<code>s</code> for <code>String</code>).\nYou can see all the tokens in this short example, and all the possible token types are listed in the <a href=\"https://pygments.org/docs/tokens/\">Pygments docs</a>.\n(Pygments is another syntax highlighting library, but Rouge uses the same classification system.)</p>\n\n<p>Each token has a different class in the HTML, so I can style tokens with CSS.\nFor example, if I want all function names to be blue, I can target the <code>\"nf\"</code> class:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code><span class=\"nc\">.nf</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"nl\">color</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"no\">blue</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>I wrap the entire block in a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag with a language class, like <code>&lt;pre class=\"language-go\"&gt;</code>, so I can also apply per-language styles if I want.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"separating-variablefunction-definitions-and-usage\">Separating variable/function definitions and usage</h3>\n\n<p>I want to highlight variables when they\u2019re defined, not every time they\u2019re used.\nThis gives you an overview of the structure, without drowning the code in blue.</p>\n\n<p>This is tricky with Rouge, because it has no semantic understanding of the code \u2013 it only knows what each token is, not how it\u2019s being used.\nIn the example above, it knows that <code>print</code> is the name of a function, but it doesn\u2019t know if the function is being called or being defined.</p>\n\n<p>I could use something smarter, like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_server\">language servers</a> used by modern IDEs, but that\u2019s a lot of extra complexity.\nIt might not even work \u2013 many of my code snippets are fragments, not complete programs, and wouldn\u2019t parse cleanly.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, I\u2019m manually annotating my code snippets to mark definitions.\nI wrote a Jekyll plugin that reads those annotations, and modifies the HTML from Rouge to add the necessary highlights.\nIt\u2019s extra work, but I already spend a lot of time trying to pick the right snippet of code to make my point.\nThese annotations are quick and easy, and it\u2019s worth it for a clearer result.</p>\n\n<p>Older posts don\u2019t have these annotations, so they won\u2019t get the full benefit of the new colour scheme, but I\u2019m gradually updating them.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-do-i-like-about-this-new-design\">What do I like about this new design?</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"its-pushed-me-to-think-more-about-syntax-highlighting\">It\u2019s pushed me to think more about syntax highlighting</h3>\n\n<p>Now that I\u2019m not using somebody else\u2019s rules, I\u2019m paying more attention to how my code looks.\nI\u2019m thinking more carefully about how my rules should apply. \nI\u2019m noticing when colours feel confusing or unclear, and finding small ways to tweak them to improve clarity.</p>\n\n<p>For example, \u201cvariable definitions in blue\u201d sounds pretty clear cut, but does that include imports?\nFunction parameters?\nWhat about HTML or CSS, where variables aren\u2019t really a thing?\nWhat parts of the code do I think are important and worth highlighting?</p>\n\n<p>I could have asked these questions at any time, but changing my syntax highlighting gave me the push to actually do it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"it-makes-comments-more-prominent\">It makes comments more prominent</h3>\n\n<p>In my first programming job, I worked in a codebase with extensive comemnts.\nThey were a good starting point in unfamiliar code, with lots of context, explanation, and narrative.\nThe company\u2019s default IDE showed comments in bright blue, and looking back, I\u2019m sure that colour choice encouraged the culture of detailed documentation.</p>\n\n<p>I realise now how unusual that was, but at the time it was my only experience of professional software development.\nI carried that habit of writing coomments into subsequent jobs, but I\u2019d forgotten the colour scheme.\nNow, I\u2019m finally reviving that good idea.</p>\n\n<p>Comments are bright red in my new theme \u2013 not the subdued grey used by so many other themes. \nThe pop of colour makes comments easier to spot and more inviting to read.\nI\u2019ve also ported this style to my IDE, and now when I write comments, I don\u2019t feel like my words are disappearing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"it-might-be-easier-to-read\">It might be easier to read</h3>\n\n<p>I was inspired to make this change by reading Nikita Prokopov\u2019s article, which argues for a minimal colour scheme \u2013 but not everyone agrees.</p>\n\n<p>Syntax highlighting is mostly a matter of taste.\nSome programmers like a clean, light theme, others prefer high-contrast dark themes with bold colours. \nThere\u2019s lots of research into how we read code, but as far as I know, there\u2019s no strong evidence or consensus in favour of any particular approach.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever your taste, I think code is easier to read in a colour scheme you\u2019re already familiar with.\nYou know what the colours mean, so your brain doesn\u2019t have to learn anything.\nA new scheme might grow on you over time, but at first, it\u2019s more likely to be distracting than helpful.</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s a problem for a blog like this.\nMost readers find a single post through search, read something useful, and never return.\nThey\u2019re not reading enough code here to learn my colour scheme, and unfamiliar colours are just noise.</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind, I think a minimal palette works better.\nMy posts only contain short snippets of code \u2013 enough to make a point, but not full files or complex programs.\nWhen you\u2019re only reading a small amount of code, it\u2019s more useful to highlight key elements than wash everything in colour.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"better-late-than-never\">Better late than never</h2>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve wanted to improve my code snippets for a long time, but it always felt overwhelming. \nI\u2019m used to colour themes which use a large palette, and I don\u2019t have the design skills to choose that many colours.\nIt wasn\u2019t until I thought about using a smaller palette that this felt doable</p>\n\n<p>I picked my new colours just a few days ago, and already the old design feels stale and tired.\nI\u2019d planned to spend more time tinkering before I make it live, but it\u2019s such an improvement I want to use it immediately.</p>\n\n<p>I love having a little corner of the web which is my own personal sandbox.\nThirteen years in, and I\u2019m still finding new ways to make myself smile.</p>\n\n\n    <p>[If the

                "<div class=\"lead\"><p>Fly.io transmogrifies Docker containers into Fly Machines: micro-VMs running on our own hardware all over the world. The hardest part of running this platform isn\u2019t managing the servers, and it isn\u2019t operating the network; it\u2019s gluing those two things together.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Several times a second, as customer CI/CD pipelines tear up or bring down <a href=\"https://fly.io/machines\" title=\"\">Fly Machines</a>, our state synchronization system blasts updates across our internal mesh, so that edge proxies from Tokyo to Amsterdam can keep the accurate routing table that allows them to route requests for applications to the nearest customer instances.</p>\n\n<p>On September 1, 2024, at 3:30PM EST, a new Fly Machine came up with a new &ldquo;virtual service&rdquo; configuration option a developer had just shipped. Within a few seconds every proxy in our fleet had locked up hard. It was the worst outage we&rsquo;ve experienced: a period during which no end-user requests could reach our customer apps at all.</p>\n\n<p>Distributed systems are blast amplifiers. By propagating data across a network, they also propagate bugs in the systems that depend on that data. In the case of Corrosion, our state distribution system, those bugs propagate <strong class=\"font-semibold text-navy-950\">quickly</strong>. The proxy code that handled that Corrosion update had succumbed to a <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42093551\" title=\"\">notorious Rust concurrency footgun</a>: an <code>if let</code> expression over an <code>RWLock</code> assumed (reasonably, but incorrectly) in its <code>else</code> branch that the lock had been released. Instant and virulently contagious deadlock.</p>\n\n<p>A lesson we&rsquo;ve learned the hard way: never trust a distributed system without an interesting failure story. If a distributed system hasn&rsquo;t ruined a weekend or kept you up overnight, you don&rsquo;t understand it yet. Which is why that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re introducing Corrosion, an unconventional service discovery system we built for our platform <a href=\"https://github.com/superfly/corrosion\" title=\"\">and  open sourced</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"group flex items-start whitespace-pre-wrap relative mt-14 sm:mt-16 mb-4 text-navy-950 font-heading\" id=\"our-face-seeking-rake\"><a class=\"inline-block align-text-top relative top-[.15em] w-6 h-6 -ml-6 after:hash opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-all\" href=\"https://fly.io/blog/feed.xml#our-face-seeking-rake\"></a><span class=\"plain-code\">Our Face-Seeking Rake</span></h2>\n<p>State synchronization is the hardest problem in running a platform like ours. So why build a risky new distributed system for it? Because no matter what we try, that rake is waiting for our foot. The reason is our orchestration model.</p>\n\n<p>Virtually every mainstream orchestration system (including Kubernetes) relies on a centralized database to make decisions about where to place new workloads. Individual servers keep track of what they&rsquo;re running, but that central database is the source of truth. At Fly.io, in order to scale across dozens of regions globally, <a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/carving-the-scheduler-out-of-our-orchestrator/\" title=\"\">we flip that notion on its head</a>: individual servers are the source of truth for their workloads.</p>\n\n<p>In our platform, our central API bids out work to what is in effect a global market of competing &ldquo;worker&rdquo; physical servers. By moving the authoritative source of information from a central scheduler to individual servers, we scale out without bottlenecking on a database that demands both responsiveness and consistency between S\u00e3o Paulo, Virginia, and Sydney.</p>\n\n<p>The bidding model is elegant, but it&rsquo;s insufficient to route network requests. To allow an HTTP request in Tokyo to find the nearest instance in Sydney, we really do need some kind of global map of every app we host.</p>\n\n<p>For longer than we should have, we relied on <a href=\"https://github.com/hashicorp/consul\" title=\"\">HashiCorp Consul</a> to route traffic. Consul is fantastic software. Don&rsquo;t build a global routing system on it. Then we <a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/a-foolish-consistency/\" title=\"\">built SQLite caches of Consul</a>. SQLite: also fantastic. But don&rsquo;t do this either.</p>\n\n<p>Like an unattended turkey deep frying on the patio, truly global distributed consensus promises deliciousness while yielding only immolation. <a href=\"https://raft.github.io/\" title=\"\">Consensus protocols like Raft </a>break down over long distances. And they work against the architecture of our platform: our Consul cluster, running on the biggest iron we could buy, wasted time guaranteeing consensus for updates that couldn&rsquo;t conflict in the first place.</p>\n<h2 class=\"group flex items-start whitespace-pre-wrap relative mt-14 sm:mt-16 mb-4 text-navy-950 font-heading\" id=\"corrosion\"><a class=\"inline-block align-text-top relative top-[.15em] w-6 h-6 -ml-6 after:hash opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-all\" href=\"https://fly.io/blog/feed.xml#corrosion\"></a><span class=\"plain-code\">Corrosion</span></h2>\n<p>To build a global routing database, we moved away from distributed consensus and took cues from actual routing protocols.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First\" title=\"\">A protocol like OSPF</a> has the same operating model and many of the same constraints we do. OSPF is a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-state_routing_protocol\" title=\"\">link-state routing protocol</a>&rdquo;, which, conveniently for us, means that routers are sources of truth for their own links and responsible for quickly communicating  changes to every other router, so the network can make forwarding decisions.</p>\n\n<p>We have things easier than OSPF does. Its flooding algorithm can&rsquo;t assume connectivity between arbitrary routers (solving that problem is the point of OSPF). But we run a global, fully connected WireGuard mesh between our servers. All we need to do is gossip efficiently.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/superfly/corrosion\" title=\"\">Corrosion is a Rust program</a> that propagates a SQLite database with a gossip protocol.</p>\n\n<p>Like Consul, our gossip protocol is <a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/building-clusters-with-serf#what-serf-is-doing\" title=\"\">built on SWIM</a>. Start with the simplest, dumbest group membership protocol you can imagine: every node spams every node it learns about with heartbeats. Now, just two tweaks: first, each step of the protocol, spam a random subset of nodes, not the whole set. Then, instead of freaking out when a heartbeat fails, mark it &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; and ask another random subset of neighbors to ping it for you. SWIM converges on global membership very quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Once membership worked out, we run QUIC between nodes in the cluster to broadcast changes and reconcile state for new nodes.</p>\n\n<p>Corrosion looks like a globally synchronized database. You can open it with SQLite and just read things out of its tables. What makes it interesting is what it doesn&rsquo;t do: no locking, no central servers, and no distributed consensus. Instead, we exploit our orchestration model: workers own their own state, so updates from different workers almost never conflict.</p>\n\n<p>We do impose some order. Every node in a Corrosion cluster will eventually receive the same set of updates, in some order. To ensure every instance arrives at the same &ldquo;working set&rdquo; picture, we use <a href=\"https://github.com/vlcn-io/cr-sqlite\" title=\"\">cr-sqlite, the CRDT SQLite extension</a>.</p>\n\n<p>cr-sqlite works by marking specified SQLite tables as CRDT-managed. For these table, changes to any column of a row are logged in a special <code>crsql_changes</code>table. Updates to tables are applied last-write-wins using logical timestamps (that is, causal ordering rather than wall-clock ordering). <a href=\"https://github.com/superfly/corrosion/blob/main/doc/crdts.md\" title=\"\">You can read much more about how that works here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As rows are updated in Corrosion&rsquo;s ordinary SQL tables, the resulting changes are collected from <code>crsql_changes</code>. They&rsquo;re bundled into batched update packets and gossiped.</p>\n\n<p>When things are going smoothly, Corrosion is easy to reason about. Many customers of Corrosion&rsquo;s data don&rsquo;t even need to know it exists, just where the database is. We don&rsquo;t fret over &ldquo;leader elections&rdquo; or bite our nails watching metrics for update backlogs. And it&rsquo;s fast as all get-out.</p>\n<h2 class=\"group flex items-start whitespace-pre-wrap relative mt-14 sm:mt-16 mb-4 text-navy-950 font-heading\" id=\"shit-happens\"><a class=\"inline-block align-text-top relative top-[.15em] w-6 h-6 -ml-6 after:hash opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-all\" href=\"https://fly.io/blog/feed.xml#shit-happens\"></a><span class=\"plain-code\">Shit Happens</span></h2>\n<p>This is a story about how we made one good set of engineering decisions and <a href=\"https://how.complexsystems.fail/\" title=\"\">never experienced any problems</a>. <a href=\"https://www.somethingsimilar.com/2013/01/14/notes-on-distributed-systems-for-young-bloods/\" title=\"\">Please clap</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We told you already about the worst problem Corrosion was involved with: efficiently gossiping a deadlock bug to every proxy in our fleet, shutting our whole network down. Really, Corrosion was just a bystander for that outage. But it perpetrated others.</p>\n\n<p>Take a classic ops problem: the unexpectedly expensive DDL change. You wrote a simple migration, tested it, merged it to main, and went to bed, wrongly assuming the migration wouldn&rsquo;t cause an outage when it ran in prod. Happens to the best of us.</p>\n\n<p>Now spice it up. You made a trivial-seeming schema change to a CRDT table hooked up to a global gossip system. Now, when the deploy runs, thousands of high-powered servers around the world join a chorus of database reconciliation messages that melts down the entire cluster.</p>\n\n<p>That happened to us last year when a team member added a nullable column to a Corrosion table. New nullable columns are kryptonite to large Corrosion tables: <code>cr-sqlite</code> needs to backfill values for every row in the table. It played out as if every Fly Machine on our platform had suddenly changed state simultaneously, just to fuck us.</p>\n\n<p>Gnarlier war story: for a long time we ran both Corrosion and Consul, because two distributed systems means twice the resiliency. One morning, a Consul mTLS certificate expired. Every worker in our fleet severed its connection to Consul.</p>\n\n<p>We should have been fine. We had Corrosion running. Except: under the hood, every worker in the fleet is doing a backoff loop trying to reestablish connectivity to Consul. Each of those attempts re-invokes a code path to update Fly Machine state. That code path incurs a Corrosion write.</p>\n\n<p>By the time we&rsquo;ve figured out what the hell is happening, we&rsquo;re literally saturating our uplinks almost everywhere in our fleet. We apologize to our uplink providers.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since anything like this has happened at Fly.io, but preventing the next one is basically all we think about anymore.</p>\n<h2 class=\"group flex items-start whitespace-pre-wrap relative mt-14 sm:mt-16 mb-4 text-navy-950 font-heading\" id=\"iteration\"><a class=\"inline-block align-text-top relative top-[.15em] w-6 h-6 -ml-6 after:hash opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-all\" href=\"https://fly.io/blog/feed.xml#iteration\"></a><span class=\"plain-code\">Iteration</span></h2>\n<p>In retrospect, our Corrosion rollout repeated a mistake we made with Consul: we built a single global state domain. Nothing about Corrosion&rsquo;s design required us to do this, and we&rsquo;re unwinding that decision now. Hold that thought. We got some big payoffs from some smaller lifts.</p>\n\n<p>First, and most importantly, we watchdogged everything. We showed you a contagious deadlock bug, lethal because our risk model was missing &ldquo;these Tokio programs might deadlock&rdquo;. Not anymore. Our <a href=\"https://tokio.rs/\" title=\"\">Tokio programs</a> all have built-in watchdogs; an event-loop stall will bounce the service and make a king-hell alerting racket. Watchdogs have cancelled multiple outages. Minimal code, easy win. Do this in your own systems.</p>\n\n<p>Then, we extensively tested Corrosion itself. We&rsquo;ve written about <a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/parking-lot-ffffffffffffffff/\" title=\"\">a bug we found in the Rust <code>parking_lot</code> library</a>. We spent months looking for similar bugs <a href=\"https://antithesis.com/product/how_antithesis_works/\" title=\"\">with Antithesis</a>. Again: do recommend. It retraced our steps on the <code>parking_lot</code> bug easily; the bug wouldn&rsquo;t have been worth the blog post if we&rsquo;d been using Antithesis at the time. <a href=\"https://antithesis.com/docs/multiverse_debugging/overview/\" title=\"\">Multiverse debugging</a> is killer for distributed systems.</p>\n\n<p>No amount of testing will make us trust a distributed system. So we&rsquo;ve made it simpler to rebuild Corrosion&rsquo;s database from our workers. We keep checkpoint backups of the Corrosion database on object storage. That was smart of us. When shit truly went haywire last year, we had the option to reboot the cluster, which is ultimately what we did. That eats some time (the database is large and propagating is expensive), but diagnosing and repairing distributed systems mishaps takes even longer.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve also improved the way our workers feed Corrosion. Until recently, any time a worker updated its local database, we published the same incremental update to Corrosion. <a href=\"https://community.fly.io/t/self-healing-machine-state-synchronization-and-service-discovery/26134\" title=\"\">But now we&rsquo;ve eliminated partial updates.</a> Instead, when a Fly Machine changes, we re-publish the entire data set for the Machine. Because of how Corrosion resolves changes to its own rows, the node receiving the re-published Fly Machine automatically filters out the no-op changes before gossiping them. Eliminating partial updates forecloses a bunch of bugs (and, we think, kills off a couple sneaky ones we&rsquo;ve been chasing). We should have done it this way to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s revisit that global state problem. After the contagious deadlock bug, we concluded we need to evolve past a single cluster. So we took on a project we call &ldquo;regionalization&rdquo;, which creates a two-level database scheme. Each region we operate in runs a Corrosion cluster with fine-grained data about every Fly Machine in the region. The global cluster then maps applications to regions, which is sufficient to make forwarding decisions at our edge proxies.</p>\n\n<p>Regionalization reduces the blast radius of state bugs. Most things we track don&rsquo;t have to matter outside their region (importantly, most of the code changes to what we track are also region-local). We can roll out changes to this kind of code in ways that, worst case, threaten only a single region.</p>\n<h2 class=\"group flex items-start whitespace-pre-wrap relative mt-14 sm:mt-16 mb-4 text-navy-950 font-heading\" id=\"the-new-system-works\"><a class=\"inline-block align-text-top relative top-[.15em] w-6 h-6 -ml-6 after:hash opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-all\" href=\"https://fly.io/blog/feed.xml#the-new-system-works\"></a><span class=\"plain-code\">The New System Works</span></h2>\n<p>Most distributed systems have state synchronization challenges.  Corrosion has a different &ldquo;shape&rdquo; than most of those systems:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It doesn&rsquo;t rely on distributed consensus, like <a href=\"https://github.com/hashicorp/consul\" title=\"\">Consul</a>, <a href=\"https://zookeeper.apache.org/\" title=\"\">Zookeeper</a>, <a href=\"https://etcd.io/\" title=\"\">Etcd</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/architecture/replication-layer\" title=\"\">Raft</a>, or <a href=\"https://rqlite.io/\" title=\"\">rqlite</a> (which we came very close to using).\n</li><li>It doesn&rsquo;t rely on a large-scale centralized data store, like <a href=\"https://www.foundationdb.org/\" title=\"\">FoundationDB</a> or databases backed by S3-style object storage.\n</li><li>It&rsquo;s nevertheless highly distributed (each of thousands of workers run nodes), converges quickly (in seconds), and presents as a simple SQLite database. Neat!\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t easy getting here. Corrosion is a large part of what every engineer at Fly.io who writes Rust works on.</p>\n\n<p>Part of what&rsquo;s making Corrosion work is that we&rsquo;re careful about what we put into it. Not every piece of state we manage needs gossip propagation. <code>tkdb</code>, the backend for <a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/macaroons-escalated-quickly/\" title=\"\">our Macaroon tokens</a>, is a much simpler SQLite service backed by <a href=\"https://litestream.io/\" title=\"\">Litestream</a>. So is Pet Sematary, the secret store we built to replace HashiCorp Vault.</p>\n\n<p>Still, there are probably lots of distributed state problems that want something more like a link-state routing protocol and less like a distributed database. If you think you might have one of those, <a href=\"https://github.com/superfly/corrosion\" title=\"\">feel free to take Corrosion for a spin</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Corrosion is J\u00e9r\u00f4me Gravel-Niquet&rsquo;s brainchild. For the last couple years, much of the iteration on it was led by Somtochi Onyekwere and Peter Cai. The work was alternately cortisol- and endorphin-inducing. We&rsquo;re glad to finally get to talk about it in detail.</p>"

And while I don't necessarily view Bear as a business, MicroConf is the closest there is to an <em>Industry Event</em> for someone like me.</p>\n<p>First a note on Istanbul:</p>\n<p>I arrived a week early to explore the city and see the sights. I'm a bit of a history nerd, so being at the crossroads of <em>where it all happened</em> in Europe\u2014going back thousands of years\u2014was quite spectacular. I get up early, and wandering the empty streets of the old city before the tour groups flooded in was quite special.</p>\n<p>Also, the mosques dotting the skyline as viewed from the Bosporus are like nothing I've ever seen. It's amazing to see human effort geared towards creating beautiful buildings. I know it's not economically viable, but imagine if cities were built with beauty and a cohesive aesthetic in mind.</p>\n<p>There were, however, a few negative characteristics of the city that grated at me, the main one being the hard separation of what is the <em>tourist area</em> and what isn't. Inside the old city all of the restaurants were clones, serving the same <em>authentic Turkish food</em> at 5x the reasonable price.</p>\n<p>And scams were rife. I remember after a mediocre lunch at a mediocre restaurant, looking at the hand-written bill, the per-person cost came to about 2000TRY (roughly $50 at the time). The staff didn't speak English, and I wasn't going to throw all of my toys out of the cot via Google Translate, so I begrudgingly paid the bill and vowed never to eat there again. Similarly with taxis: it was impossible to take one as a foreigner without an attempted scam, to the extent the conference coordinator put out a PSA to use a specific transport company for rides instead of using the local taxis.</p>\n<p>It's unfortunate when a city is unwelcoming in this manner, and it left a bad taste in my mouth.</p>\n<p>Putting all of that aside, I still had a spectacular time. The main reason I came to this conference was to learn, get inspired, and soak up the vibes from other interesting people building interesting things. And I got exactly what I came for.</p>\n<p>The talks and workshops were good, but what made the event shine was the <em>in-between times</em> spent with other attendees. The meals and walks, the <em>hammam</em> and sauna sessions. I found myself engaged from sunrise to sunset, notebook not far away, transcribing those notes during my downtime.</p>\n<p>One of the attendees, <a href=\"https://schoberg.net\" target=\"_blank\">Jesse Schoberg</a>, runs a blogging platform as well, which focusses on embeddable blogs for organisations. It's called <a href=\"https://dropinblog.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DropInBlog</a> and is a really neat solution and platform. We chatted about what it's like running this kind of service, from bots to discoverability, and enjoyed the sunset on the terrace overlooking the Sea of Marmara. I can't think of a better place to talk shop.</p>\n<p>I can't list all of the great conversations I had over those 3 days, but one standout to me was dinner with the <a href=\"https://www.conversionfactory.co/\" target=\"_blank\">ConversionFactory</a> lads: Zach, Nick, and Cory. Not only were they one of the event sponsors, but were just great people to hang out with\u2014and obviously incredibly proficient at their craft. After dinner on the last evening of the conference we crowded into the steam room to take advantage of the hotel's amenities that I'd paid way too much for. I got too hot, and mistaking the basin in the middle of the room for cooling off, managed to splash strong, menthol-infused water on my face. I immediately regretted it. My face, eyes, and nose started burning intensely with the icy-cold blaze of menthol and I was temporarily blinded. I had one of them hose off my face since I couldn't do anything in that state.</p>\n<p>Product idea: Mace, but menthol.</p>\n<p>One of my friends, <a href=\"https://robhope.com\" target=\"_blank\">Rob Hope</a>, just arrived back from giving a talk at a conference in the US. When I met up with him for dumplings and dinner last week, it came up that, coincidentally, he had also just met the ConversionFactory lads on his most recent trip. I guess they get around.</p>\n<p>Will I come back to MicroConf? Without a doubt. This has been inspiring, educational, and also quite validating. People were impressed with my projects, and surprised that I don't track visitors, conversions, and other <em>important metrics</em>. Bear is healthy, paying me a good salary while being aligned with my values, ethos, and lifestyle.</p>\n<p>I guess I'm running on vibes, and the vibes are good.</p>"

The Book of Revelation was written around 95 AD by St. John of Patmos. Most secular scholars interpret it as an allegorical description of events in John&#8217;s own time, especially the Roman persecution of the early church. But millennia of Christian commentators have treated it as a prophecy about some future cataclysm - most often during the commentator&#8217;s own era. In the 10th century, a renegade bishop declared Pope John XV to be the Antichrist. In the 19th century, the Russian Old Believers accused Napoleon of the same. In our own day, American evangelicals have proposed everyone from Saddam Hussein to Barack Obama.</p><p>All these people fell victim to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronocentrism\">chronocentrism</a> - a bias to evaluate one&#8217;s own era as uniquely important.

Most commentators collapse these into one beast - &#8216;the&#8217; Beast - and I will anxiously follow their lead despite losing some potential subtlety.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XlvZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe982757b-a210-4581-bde4-d7fda747ef77_692x514.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"464.97687861271675\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XlvZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe982757b-a210-4581-bde4-d7fda747ef77_692x514.png\" width=\"626\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>According to Revelation 13:14-15:</p><blockquote><p>[The Beast] had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should speak. </p></blockquote><p>In the context of our working hypothesis, this sounds like the Beast is an AI company, creating an LLM. </p><p>But if the Beast is an AI company, which one is it? In 13:1, John gives us several clues:</p><blockquote><p>I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the names of blasphemy.</p></blockquote><p>The Beast has seven heads. In the context of an AI company, this might mean seven CEOs, presidents, or co-founders. I was unable to find an AI company with this many CEOs or presidents, but here&#8217;s the co-founder count for each of the major labs:</p><ul><li><p><strong>OpenAI: </strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI\">11 co-founders</a></p></li><li><p><strong>DeepMind:</strong> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_DeepMind\">3 co-founders</a> </p></li><li><p><strong>xAI: </strong><a href=\"https://tracxn.com/d/companies/xai/__saKrxbHN3TRWW-I4lYH6zkx6N5P_kMTqlLcKTzWs2ug\">5 co-founders</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Anthropic: </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om2lIWXLLN4\">7 co-founders</a></p></li></ul><p>So Anthropic is a good match for the first part of the prophecy. </p><p>What about the second part? What does it mean for the Beast to have ten horns? </p><p>This one confused me for a while, but I eventually found <a href=\"https://www.failory.com/blog/decacorns\">this list</a>:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NGn3!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7aaed5a-8f1b-442c-a449-edc2ebe66872_1067x555.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NGn3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7aaed5a-8f1b-442c-a449-edc2ebe66872_1067x555.png\" width=\"1067\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>In Silicon Valley speak, a &#8220;unicorn&#8221; is a company worth over $1 billion, and a &#8220;decacorn&#8221; (Latin for &#8220;ten-horned&#8221;) is a company worth over $10 billion. Under this interpretation, the ten horns of the prophecy have ten crowns because they represent wealth and achievement. The only AI company on the list above is Anthropic, at #9.</p><p>Finally, John says that upon the heads will be names of blasphemy. If the heads represent co-founders, it sounds like John is claiming the co-founders of the company will have blasphemous names. I could not find anything blasphemous about the names of the founders of OpenAI, DeepMind, or xAI. But looking at Anthropic:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Dario Amodei</strong> is the first co-founder. &#8220;Dario&#8221; comes from the Persian &#8220;Darius&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.gotquestions.org/Darius-in-the-Bible.html\">meaning</a> &#8220;Lord&#8221;. &#8220;Amodei&#8221; is of unclear meaning, but I cannot help but notice the resemblance with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asmodei\">Asmodei</a> (also called Ashmodei, Hamadee, &#198;shmad&#230;va, and Asmodeus), a demon-king mentioned in the book of Tobit. Plausibly all these different names derive from a Proto-Sumerian root *Amodei, in which case the meaning of &#8220;Dario Amodei&#8221; would be &#8220;Asmodeus is lord&#8221;. This is a name of blasphemy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Daniela Amodei</strong> is the second co-founder. Daniela comes from Hebrew Daniel, <a href=\"https://www.thebump.com/b/daniel-baby-name\">meaning</a> &#8220;God is my judge&#8221;. So &#8220;Daniela Amodei&#8221; means &#8220;Asmodeus is God my judge&#8221;. This is also a name of blasphemy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jared Kaplan</strong> is the third co-founder. Jared means &#8220;fallen&#8221; or &#8220;descended&#8221; in Hebrew, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared\">supposedly because</a> the Biblical Jared was patriarch during the time when the fallen angels descended to Earth. Kaplan is just the German form of chaplain, meaning &#8220;priest&#8221;. So &#8220;Jared Kaplan&#8221; means &#8220;fallen priest&#8221; or &#8220;priest of fallen angels&#8221;. This is also a name of blasphemy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Christopher Olah</strong> is the fourth co-founder. Christopher <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher\">is Greek for</a> &#8220;bringer of Christ&#8221;. Olah (&#1506;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;) in Hebrew <a href=\"https://biblehub.com/hebrew/5930.htm\">means </a>&#8220;burnt offering&#8221;; the Greek translation <a href=\"https://biblehub.com/greek/3646.htm\">is</a> &#8001;&#955;&#959;&#954;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#957;, meaning &#8220;total destruction&#8221;, because the <em>olah</em> was an especially thorough sacrifice in which the entire animal was reduced to ash. So &#8220;Christopher Olah&#8221; means &#8220;bringer of Christ to total destruction&#8221;. This is also a name of blasphemy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ben Mann<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> </strong>is the fifth co-founder. Ben <a href=\"https://www.thebump.com/b/ben-baby-name\">means</a> &#8220;son&#8221; in Hebrew, and Mann means &#8220;man&#8221; in German, so this translates to &#8220;Son of Man&#8221;. This is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_of_man#New_Testament\">a title claimed by Jesus</a>; for a human to take it makes it a name of blasphemy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tom Brown</strong> is the sixth co-founder. Thomas <a href=\"https://www.thebump.com/b/thomas-baby-name\">means</a> &#8220;twin&#8221; in Greek, and Brown <a href=\"https://www.etymonline.com/word/brown\">means </a>&#8220;dark&#8221; or &#8220;dusky&#8221; in Old English, so this translates to &#8220;dark twin&#8221;. Satanists <a href=\"https://www.paulvitols.com/2011/11/the-devil-by-jeffrey-burton-russell/\">refer to</a> the Devil as the &#8220;dark twin&#8221; of God; this is also a name of blasphemy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Samuel McCandlish</strong> is the seventh co-founder. Samuel is related to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samael\">Samael</a>, another demon-king. McCandlish is <a href=\"https://cuindlis.org/history/\">Gaelic</a> for &#8220;son of the lord&#8221;. So this name means &#8220;Samael is the son of the Lord&#8221;. This is another name of blasphemy.</p></li></ul><p>So we see that all seven co-founders have names of blasphemy. If the chance of a randomly selected person having a blasphemous name is 1%, then the chance of seven people having such names entirely by coincidence is 10^-14, or one in one hundred trillion.</p><p>Given that Anthropic has seven heads, ten horns, and on each head a name of blasphemy, the case for identifying it with the Beast is strong. However, we cannot move on before examining one last verse from this chapter, probably the most famous of all. From Revelation 13:18:</p><blockquote><p>Let him that hath understanding count the number of the Beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is 666.</p></blockquote><p>Many people have tried to decode this verse. Here&#8217;s my paltry contribution: in other cases where the New Testament uses the phrase &#8220;the number of the X&#8221;, it means the number of people in a group. For example:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2022%3A3&amp;version=KJV\">Luke 22:3</a>:<strong> </strong>&#8220;Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of <em>the number of the</em> twelve [apostles].&#8221;</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%204%3A4&amp;version=KJV\">Acts 4:4</a>: &#8220;But many of those who had heard the Word believed, and <em>the number of the</em> men came to about five thousand.&#8221;</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%209%3A16&amp;version=KJV\">Revelation 9:16</a>: &#8220;And <em>the number of the</em> army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.&#8221;</p></li></ul><p>These are all the same Greek word, &#7936;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#956;&#972;&#962;. None of them mean a secret mysterious number that symbolizes their identity. They all mean something like &#8220;headcount&#8221;. So to be consistent, you would translate Revelation 13:18 as:</p><blockquote><p>Let him that hath understanding take the headcount of the Beast: for it is the headcount of a man; and his headcount is 666.</p></blockquote><p>This is looking good for our hypothesis that the Beast is an AI company. There&#8217;s only one remaining hurdle. The second clause specifically says that we&#8217;re talking about the number/headcount &#8220;of a man&#8221; rather than of a company. Can we square this circle?</p><p>Not all translations say &#8220;the number of a man&#8221;. Some say &#8220;the number of humanity&#8221;, or &#8220;the number of mankind&#8221;. The <a href=\"https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-18.htm#lexicon\">exact phrase</a> is &#8220;&#7936;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#956;&#8056;&#962; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#974;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#8221;, and the word at issue meaning man/humanity/mankind is the last one, &#8220;&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#974;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#8221;.</p><p>In our alphabet, this word is <em>anthropou</em>. It is the genitive form of the stem <em>anthrop-</em>, meaning man/humanity, and predictably means &#8220;of man/humanity&#8221;. This word has come into English pretty much wholly intact, with the Greek genitive ending (-&#959;&#965;) simply changed to the corresponding English ending (-ic). It is our word &#8220;anthropic&#8221;, meaning &#8220;of man/humanity&#8221;. Why would you use any other word in a translation? Thus:</p><blockquote><p>Let him that hath understanding take the headcount of the Beast: for it is the headcount of Anthropic; and its headcount is 666.</p></blockquote><p>What is the headcount of Anthropic?

First, Revelation 11:3:</p><blockquote><p>And I will appoint my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.</p></blockquote><p>The Lamb will be preceded by two witnesses. Revelation itself does not name them, but Jewish tradition <a href=\"https://www.gotquestions.org/two-witnesses.html\">says </a>that one will be the prophet Elijah.</p><p>Second, 12:1:</p><blockquote><p>And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on Mount Zion, and with him a hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father&#8217;s name written in their foreheads.</p></blockquote><p>The Lamb will stand on Mount Zion.

I prefer to identify him with a different character in Revelation, namely the Dragon.</p><p>On the level of Biblical narrative - the same level where the Woman is the Virgin Mary - the Dragon is clearly Satan.

Who gives companies their power, then demands to be worshiped by them? Obviously VCs.

There&#8217;s some textual support here too, this time in Daniel 7, another apocalyptic prophecy generally considered to address the same events as Revelation from a different perspective.</p><p>Daniel has a vision of four beasts: a winged lion, a bear, a leopard, and a many-headed monster. The monster is the worst and final beast, and it has ten horns. Then a &#8220;little horn&#8221;, a &#8220;horn with human eyes&#8221;, shows up, defeats three of the original horns, and takes over. Then the monster begins a reign of terror, and finally is defeated by God.</p><p>If, as before, the beasts represent companies, then the four beasts of Daniel correspond to the four major AI labs: Google DeepMind, X.AI, OpenAI, and Anthropic. How? I think these correspond to the ethnicity of the founders:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Bear</strong> = <strong>Google</strong>, founded by Sergey Brin (Russian)</p></li><li><p><strong>Leopard </strong>= <strong>X.AI</strong>, founded by Elon Musk (South African)</p></li><li><p><strong>Winged Lion = OpenAI</strong>, founded by Sam Altman (Jewish). The winged lion would have been recognizable to Daniel&#8217;s audience as a symbol of the Babylonian Empire; Daniel was writing during the Babylonian Captivity, when there was no independent Israeli state and all Jews lived in Babylon.</p></li><li><p><strong>Many-Headed Monster</strong> <strong>= Anthropic</strong>, as in the Beast section above.</p></li></ul><p>Anthropic is pictured as having ten horns. An angel explains to Daniel that these are its ten &#8220;kings&#8221;. If we stick to our interpretation above, where the horns = decacorn = billions of dollars, perhaps in this vision, the horns are billionaire investors controlling the company. The Antichrist - the &#8220;little horn&#8221; or &#8220;horn with human eyes&#8221; - is a billionaire who will manage some kind of boardroom coup or hostile takeover, displacing the original investors.</p><p>In what sense is Marc Andreessen a &#8220;little horn&#8221;? In traditional commentary on Daniel, this refers to the Antichrist starting as a seemingly-insignificant king, much weaker than those he ultimately defeats. This matches Andreessen, who, with a fortune of only $2 billion, seems an unlikely candidate to stand up to titans like Brin ($150 billion) or Musk ($400 billion).</p><p>In what sense is Marc Andreessen a &#8220;horn with human eyes&#8221;?
