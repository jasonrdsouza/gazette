Even functional languages like\nHaskell, OCaml, and Scala feature exceptions prominently in their grammar, even if their usage is\nfrowned upon by parts of the community.</p>\n<p>But the same can be said about Go, Rust, Swift, and Zig! Their error handling is similar to each\nother, and quite distinct from the previous bunch, with Kotlin and Dart being notable, ahem,\nexceptions. Here are some commonalities of modern error handling:</p>\n<p><em>First</em>, and most notably, functions that can fail are annotated at the call side. While the old way\nlooked like this:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code-block\">\n\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-type\">Widget</span> <span class=\"hl-variable\">widget</span> <span class=\"hl-operator\">=</span> make_widget();</span></code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n<p>the new way is</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code-block\">\n\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hl-variable\">widget</span> = <span class=\"hl-title function_ invoke__\">make_widget</span>()?;</span></code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n<figure class=\"code-block\">\n\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">const</span> widget = <span class=\"hl-keyword\">try</span> make_widget();</span></code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n<figure class=\"code-block\">\n\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">let</span> widget <span class=\"hl-operator\">=</span> <span class=\"hl-keyword\">try</span> makeWidget()</span></code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n<figure class=\"code-block\">\n\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"line\">widget, err := makeWidget()</span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">if</span> err != <span class=\"hl-literal\">nil</span> {</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"hl-keyword\">return</span> err</span>\n<span class=\"line\">}</span></code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n<p>There\u2019s a syntactic marker alerting the reader that a particular operation is fallible, though the\nverbosity of the marker varies. For the writer, the marker ensures that changing the function\ncontract from infallible to fallible (or vice versa) requires changing not only the function\ndefinition itself, but the entire call chain. On the other hand, adding a new error condition to a\nset of possible errors of a fallible function generally <em>doesn\u2019t</em> require reconsidering rethrowing\ncall-sites.</p>\n<p><em>Second</em>, there\u2019s a separate, distinct mechanism that is invoked in case of a detectable bug. In\nJava, index out of bounds or null pointer dereference (examples of programming errors) use the same\nlanguage machinery as operational errors. Rust, Go, Swift, and Zig use a separate panic path. In Go\nand Rust, panics unwind the stack, and they are recoverable via a library function. In Swift and\nZig, panic aborts the entire process. Operational error of a lower layer can be classified as a\nprogramming error by the layer above, so there\u2019s generally a mechanism to escalate an erroneous\nresult value to a panic. But the opposite is more important: a function which does only \u201cordinary\u201d\ncomputations <em>can</em> be buggy, and <em>can</em> fail, but such failures are considered <em>catastrophic</em> and are\ninvisible in the type system, and sufficiently transparent at runtime.</p>\n<p><em>Third</em>, results of fallible computation are first-class values, as in Rust\u2019s <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>.\nThere\u2019s generally little type system machinery dedicated exclusively to errors and <code>try</code> expressions\nare just a little more than syntax sugar for that little Go spell. This isn\u2019t true for Swift, which\ndoes treat errors specially. For example, the generic\n<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sequence/map(_:)\"><code>map</code></a> function has to explicitly\ncare about errors, and hard-codes the decision to bail early:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code-block\">\n\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">func</span> <span class=\"hl-title function_\">map</span>&lt;<span class=\"hl-type\">T</span>, <span class=\"hl-type\">E</span>&gt;(</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"hl-keyword\">_</span> <span class=\"hl-params\">transform</span>: (<span class=\"hl-keyword\">Self</span>.<span class=\"hl-type\">Element</span>) <span class=\"hl-keyword\">throws</span>(<span class=\"hl-type\">E</span>) -&gt; <span class=\"hl-type\">T</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\">) <span class=\"hl-keyword\">throws</span>(<span class=\"hl-type\">E</span>) -&gt; [<span class=\"hl-type\">T</span>] <span class=\"hl-keyword\">where</span> <span class=\"hl-type\">E</span> : <span class=\"hl-type\">Error</span></span></code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n<p>Swift does provide <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/result\">first-classifier type</a>\nfor errors.</p>\n<p>Should you want to handle an exception, rather than propagate it, the handling is localized to\na single throwing expression to deal with a single specific errors, rather than with any error from\na block of statements:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code-block\">\n\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hl-variable\">widget</span> = <span class=\"hl-keyword\">match</span> <span class=\"hl-title function_ invoke__\">make_widget</span>() {</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"hl-title function_ invoke__\">Ok</span>(it) =&gt; it,</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"hl-title function_ invoke__\">Err</span>(WidgetError::NotFound) =&gt; <span class=\"hl-title function_ invoke__\">default_widget</span>(),</span>\n<span class=\"line\">};</span></code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n<figure class=\"code-block\">\n\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"line\">let widget = make_widget() <span class=\"hl-keyword\">catch</span> <span class=\"hl-operator\">|</span>err<span class=\"hl-operator\">|</span> <span class=\"hl-keyword\">switch</span> (err) {</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"hl-keyword\">error</span>.NotFound =&gt; default_widget(),</span>\n<span class=\"line\">};</span></code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n<p>Swift again sticks to more traditional try catch, but, interestingly, Kotlin does have <code>try</code>\nexpressions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The largest remaining variance is in what the error value looks like. This still feels like a\nresearch area. This is a hard problem due to a fundamental tension:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nOn the one hand, at lower-levels you want to exhaustively enumerate errors to make sure that:\n<ul>\n<li>\ninternal error handling logic is complete and doesn\u2019t miss a case,\n</li>\n<li>\npublic API doesn\u2019t leak any extra surprise error conditions.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nOn the other hand, at higher-levels, you want to string together widely different functionality\nfrom many separate subsystems without worrying about specific errors, other than:\n<ul>\n<li>\nseparating fallible functions from infallible,\n</li>\n<li>\nensuring that there is some top-level handler to show a 500 error or an equivalent.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The two extremes are well understood. For exhaustiveness, nothing beats sum types (<code>enum</code>s in Rust).\nThis I think is one of the key pieces which explains why the pendulum seemingly swung back on\nchecked exceptions.</p>\n<p>In Java, a method can throw one of the several exceptions:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code-block\">\n\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">void</span> <span class=\"hl-title function_\">f</span><span class=\"hl-params\">()</span> <span class=\"hl-keyword\">throws</span> FooException, BarException;</span></code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n<p>Critically, you <em>can\u2019t</em> abstract over this pair. The call chain has to either repeat the two cases,\nor type-erase them into a superclass, losing information. The former has a nasty side-effect that\nthe entire chain needs updating if a third variant is added. Java-style checked exceptions are\nsensitive to \u201cN to N + 1\u201d transitions. Modern value-oriented error management is only sensitive  to\n\u201c0 to 1\u201d transition.</p>\n<p>Still, if I am back to writing Java at any point, I\u2019d be <em>very</em> tempted to standardize on\ncoarse-grained <code>throws Exception</code> signature for all throwing methods. This is exactly the <em>second</em>\nwell understood extreme: there\u2019s a type-erased universal error type, and the \u201cthrowableness\u201d of a\nfunction contains one bit of information. We only care <em>if</em> the function can throw, and the error\nitself can be whatever. You still can downcast dynamic error value handle specific conditions, but\nthe downcasting is not checked by the compiler. That is, downcasting is \u201csave\u201d and nothing will\npanic in the error handling mechanism itself, but you\u2019ll never be sure if the errors you are\nhandling can actually arise, and whether some errors <em>should</em> be handled, but aren\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Go and Swift provide first-class universal errors, like Midori. Starting with Swift 4, you can also\nnarrow the type down.</p>\n<p>Rust doesn\u2019t really have super strong conventions about the errors, but it started with mostly\nenums, and then <code>failure</code> and <code>anyhow</code> shone spotlight on the universal error type.</p>\n<p>But overall, it feels like \u201cmidpoint\u201d error handling is poorly served by either extreme. In larger\napplications, you sorta care about error kinds, and there are usually a few place where it is pretty\nimportant to be exhaustive in your handling, but threading necessary types to those few places\ninfects the rest of the codebases, and ultimately leads to \u201ca bag of everything\u201d error types with\nmany \u201cdead\u201d variants.</p>\n<p>Zig makes an interesting choice of assuming mostly closed-world compilation model, and relying on\ncross-function inference to learn who can throw what.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>What I find the most fascinating about the story is the generational aspect. There really was a\nstrong consensus about exceptions, and then <a href=\"https://www.artima.com/articles/the-trouble-with-checked-exceptions\">an agreement that checked exceptions are a\nfailure</a>, and now, suddenly, we\nare back to \u201cchecked exceptions\u201d with a twist, in the form of \u201cerrors are values\u201d philosophy. What\nhappened between the lull of the naughts and the past decade industrial PLT renaissance?</p>"

Looking over 2025\u2019s work, there are consistent themes among the mess that help me understand the velocity of AI, its momentum and direction. I\u2019m not going to polish this too much (if you want to dive in, check out the linked posts), but this exercise is quite clarifying to me.</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the tl;dr:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Immediate AI risk comes from people over-estimating AI capabilities.</li>\n  <li>Reliability and trust are the barriers preventing wide adoption.</li>\n  <li>Evaluations remain underutilized.</li>\n  <li>Synthetic data unlocked AI capabilities, but shapes its nature</li>\n  <li>There is a growing AI perception gap between quantitative users and qualitative users.</li>\n  <li>AI leaders are letting others define the story of AI.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"immediate-ai-risk-comes-from-people-over-estimating-ai-capabilities\">Immediate AI risk comes from people over-estimating AI capabilities.</h3>\n\n<p>There are many risks we should be conscious of, but the downsides that are biting us now come from people believing in AI capabilities or sentience that isn\u2019t there. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/01/01/cyren.html\">I don\u2019t worry about superintelligent AGI\u2019s taking over the world.

The natural language interface is wonderful for its flexibility and accessibility, but it exploits our evolutionary tendency to recognize humans where there are none.</p>\n\n<p>This danger is more pronounced by our current human-in-the-loop design pattern. We\u2019re asking laypeople to evaluate AI capabilities in fields which they <em>do not understand</em>. Too often I hear, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/04/08/on-ai-observational-comics.html\">Chatbots know everything, but they make mistakes when it comes to things I know</a>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>Posts:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/01/01/cyren.html\">Beware the Cyren\u2019s Song</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/04/08/on-ai-observational-comics.html\">AI Chatbots Are Like Observational Comics</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"reliability-and-trust-are-the-barriers-preventing-wide-adoption\">Reliability and trust are the barriers preventing wide adoption.</h3>\n\n<p>As we saw above, people can easily spot issues with AI when it\u2019s working in their domain. Sure, we\u2019ve come a <em>long</em> way this year, but these gains have mostly come from <a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2024/10/18/the-3-ai-use-cases-gods-interns-and-cogs.html\">Intern-style</a> applications. We keep the humans in the loop because humans are excellent at spotting and fixing issues the 10% of the time models flail.</p>\n\n<p>But when that figure is higher than ~10% or so (these are finger-in-the-air numbers), people simply avoid the AI. Agents, especially custom enterprise ones, have <a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/12/06/the-state-of-agents.html\">a reliability problem</a> that hinders the development of the field. Teams that successfully ship agents do so by dialing back their complexity: chat interfaces, short tasks.</p>\n\n<p>But we should consider reliability a means to an end; and that end is <em>trust</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Trust is complex. It\u2019s dependent on the task being done, the risk associated with the task, the UI that presents the task, and how the agent contextualizes the produced decision. <em>Reliability</em> can be measured at the model level, but <em>trust</em> has to be assessed end-to-end: from the model, to the application, to the user.</p>\n\n<p>Frustratingly, there\u2019s few good ways to measure trust in the AI era. We can do user interviews (and I know teams that do), but these are <em>slow</em>. UX research always has been, but their pace feels especially sluggish in the context of AI-powered development, Many teams can hack this by \u201cvibe shipping\u201d \u2013 making changes to their app, pushing to production, running a few queries, then repeating \u2013 basically doing the UX reseach by themselves, on themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone else should look to <em>delegation</em>. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/07/13/delegation-is-the-ai-metric-that-matters.html\">Forget the benchmarks \u2013 the best way to track AI\u2019s capabilities is to watch which decisions experts delegate to AI</a>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>Posts:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/07/13/delegation-is-the-ai-metric-that-matters.html\">Delegation is the AI Metric that Matters</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/09/15/ai-adoption-at-work-play.html\">Enterprise AI Looks Bleak, But Employee AI Looks Bright</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/12/06/the-state-of-agents.html\">Enterprise Agents Have a Reliability Problem</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"evaluations-remain-underutilized\">Evaluations remain underutilized.</h3>\n\n<p>At first I wrote, \u201cunder-appreciated.\u201d But I think teams <em>get</em> why evaluations are valuable. The problem is most teams still don\u2019t build them.</p>\n\n<p>They get <a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/01/08/evaluating-llms-as-knowledge-banks.html\">the benefits</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The real power of a custom eval isn\u2019t just in model selection \u2013 it\u2019s in the compound benefits it delivers over time. Each new model can be evaluated in hours, not weeks. Each prompt engineering technique can be tested systematically. And perhaps most importantly, your eval grows alongside your understanding of the problem space, becoming an increasingly valuable asset for your AI development.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It used to be I had to argue that hand-tuned prompts would become overfit to a model. But OpenAI\u2019s headline model deprecations this year pushed many teams to discover this empirically.</p>\n\n<p>Despite this hiccup, many teams continue to push forward, hand-editing prompts and vibe shipping as they go. Pre-scale, this is likely optimal: the speed of iteration this allows is too valuable to ignore. As a result, <em>so many</em> teams I talk to who were previously focusing on evaluation tooling have pivoted to synthetic data creation or LLM-as-a-Judge services. Our AI capabilities have improved dramatically, but human behavior remains a constraint.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Posts:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/01/08/evaluating-llms-as-knowledge-banks.html\">Your Eval is More Important Than the Model</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/01/30/mistral-small-human-centric-benchmarks.html\">Mistral Small &amp; Human-Centric Benchmarks</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"synthetic-data-unlocked-ai-capabilities-but-shapes-its-nature\">Synthetic data unlocked AI capabilities, but shapes its nature.</h3>\n\n<p>Investing in synthetic data creation unlocked AI capabilities in 2025. <a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2024/12/18/synthetic-data-the-growing-ai-perception-divide.html\">Rephrasing high quality content into reasoning and agentic chains kept the scaling party alive</a>.

If ChatGPT or Claude can write a quick Python script to answer your question, it will.

                "<p>Here\u2019s to everyone having a great 2026 in all ways, so I figured what better way to end the year than with a little practical advice. Like everything else, dating is a skill. Practice makes perfect. It helps to combine it with outside analysis, to help you on your quest to Just Do Things.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019re Single Because You Lack Reps</h4>\n\n\n<p>A common theme in these roundups is that the best thing you can do as a young man, to get better at dating and set yourself up for success, is to get out there and engage in deliberate practice.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/CartoonsHateHer/status/1952689804111388826\">Cartoons Hate Her</a>: <a href=\"https://www.cartoonshateher.com/p/dont-delay-dating-to-build-yourself\">Today I wrote about some of the worst dating advice that young men get</a>. Namely, the advice to delay dating or relationships until they\u2019ve \u201cbuilt themselves,\u201d usually into their 30s.</p>\n<div>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-24990\"></span>\n\n\n</div>\n<p>Getting dating experience- even when it clearly doesn\u2019t matter- builds social skills and confidence. It\u2019s not something you want to deliberately defer. Dating *is* working on yourself.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/zdch/status/1952717461347766628\">Zac Hill</a>: Hard true and also generally applicable. Niko Canner told me a variant of this when I was about to work at Bridgewater to \u2018acquire skills\u2019:</p>\n<p>\u201cwhat job are you acquiring skills for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cbasically my current job\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cwe\u2019ll just keep doing that job, and you\u2019ll acquire those skills!\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>I didn\u2019t date at all until well into my 20s because of reasons, so I have some experience with this, and it is absolutely was the opposite of correct \u2018building myself\u2019 strategy. Totally counterproductive. Even in terms of otherwise building yourself, the skills you get dating will help you elsewhere, and also motivate you and direct you. There are of course temporary exceptions if you go deep into a startup or something, but yeah, absolutely get out there.</p>\n<p>As a woman, you typically (by all reports) have no trouble getting reps as such, but there is still the danger that you waste those reps if you keep repeating the same procedures without learning how to improve, which could be in any number of ways including selection.</p>\n<p>Note that reps applies the whole way through, and don\u2019t forget to postmortem.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Eliezer Yudkowsky: The way to get good at sex is the same as the way to get good at any other process: Once you\u2019re done, roll out the whiteboard and together do a no-fault analysis of what went wrong, what went right, and what could\u2019ve been done differently.</p>\n<p>Reactions divided into \u201clol u autists\u201d and \u201cwell yes that is how it works\u201d and my friends it is the second class that has acquired dangerously high sexual capabilities</p>\n<p>le petit postmortem</p>\n<p>Sofia: Both reactions are correct</p>\n<p>Aella: this is unironically the method behind the best sex of my life.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019re Single And Didn\u2019t Even Shoot Your Shot</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/TheZvi/status/1965370890457358336\">Brooke Bowman</a>: in a romantic context, what does it mean to \u2018shoot your shot\u2019? i\u2019m curious what the range of actions the phrase implies is</p>\n<p>is it like confessing your feelings/asking on a date or do you also think dropping your handkerchief counts.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I believe it means, both in romantic and non-romantic contexts: Create common knowledge that you are shooting your shot, that you are interested, and that failing to respond positively is a rejection, such that you cannot easily \u2018shoot your shot\u2019 again.</p>\n<p>Thus, anything can count, including dropping a handkerchief, if both parties know the other is sufficiently advanced.</p>\n<p>However, many people especially guys are highly clueless or ambiguously might be clueless, leading to a lot of thinking you shot your shot when you definitely haven\u2019t shot your shot. The threshold is common knowledge, not merely that they pick up on you giving them an opening. That doesn\u2019t count and does not close the book, you have only shot your shot when they know that you know that they know, and so on.</p>\n<p>If you are going to keep interacting in the future, beware \u2018wasting your shot\u2019 where you create common knowledge without giving yourself much chance to succeed. By definition you only get one shot (or at least, subsequent shots by default will at least be harder). However, that too can have advantages, as now you can move on having shot your shot, and you do create some amount of positive selection, and the act of creating common knowledge means they could reopen things in the future.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019re Single Because You Didn\u2019t Ask To Hold Her Hand</h4>\n\n\n<p>Any time someone says \u2018I don\u2019t see how this can backfire\u2019 you definitely shouldn\u2019t take their advice until you\u2019ve figured out how it can backfire.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/liron/status/1989029611930337501\">Liron Shapira</a>: As a nerdy dating expert, I consider</p>\n<p>Bryan Caplan</p>\n<p>\u2018s <a href=\"https://www.betonit.ai/p/i-want-to-hold-your-hand\">handholding tactic</a> <a href=\"https://www.betonit.ai/p/i-come-not-to-help-pick-up-artists\">to be the best practice for shy men</a> looking to get into a romantic relationship (and not be stuck in the friend zone).</p>\n<p>Could this somehow backfire? I claim it can\u2019t. Let\u2019s game it out.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The suggestion isn\u2019t that you do more requested hand holding while dating, it is to use this request as an escalation move out of a potential friend zone.</p>\n<p>The theory is that your romantic intent here is obvious, expressed in a non-creepy way, thus creating common knowledge, but it is not explicit so it is deniable common knowledge so you can still retreat to a friendship on a fail, she\u2019ll at least be impressed you tried and maybe she eventually decides to return interest even if she doesn\u2019t now, and probably she actually says yes and you can keep building from there.</p>\n<p>This is in contrast to <a href=\"https://www.betonit.ai/p/i-want-to-hold-your-hand\">Bryan\u2019s advice to do this on all first dates</a>, or at least to establish you are indeed on one, and as a way of establishing common knowledge of the situation and failing fast.</p>\n<p>The part I 100% agree with is, provided you are interested, you are better off doing something rather than doing nothing, whether on an existing date or not. Shoot your shot, whatever your shot may be. And yes, if you\u2019re too shy or unskilled to take a better or more subtle shot, then this is a shot one can take take.</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean it should be this shot. So, let us count the ways this can backfire.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>She says no, where on a better executed move she would have said yes. Then it is much harder for you to try again, indeed the whole point here is that you wouldn\u2019t try again. Skill absolutely matters, and this by design is a case of you only get one shot. Contra Liron, no, you\u2019re not going to get a yes a majority of the time.\n<ol>\n<li>In addition to it coming off weird or as representing a lack of skill or awareness, this can be seen as insufficiently ambiguous or too far up the escalation ladder if you go too early.</li>\n<li>One thing is if she\u2019s looking for a more casual vibe, going for \u2018romantic coded\u2019 actions like holding hands too early can give the ick when you were live. There\u2019s a Sex and the City where exactly this ask is an instant dealbreaker, even after they\u2019ve slept together, because it was a failure to read the room.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>She says no, where on a better executed move that did not force clarity you would have gotten a maybe or a soft no that lets you stay in the game. Forcing clarity can work against you. This is fine if you\u2019re shooting a bunch of shots, but not if this is an especially valuable shot to shoot.</li>\n<li>She says no, and rather than being impressed she is not impressed or weirded out, thus leaving the friendship in a worse position. Cost of shooting shots, but that\u2019s one way in which it is not riskless, and the less ambiguous and more awkward the shot the greater the risk of this.</li>\n<li>She says yes, but it\u2019s awkward in context, and so on.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Again, I don\u2019t want to discourage anyone too much here. It is far from the worst move, and again something beats nothing. But we don\u2019t believe in misleading anyone.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019re Single Because You\u2019re Afraid People Will Mock You Online</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/bumbadum14/status/1927858739874517252\">Bumbadum</a> (2.1m views): This type of behavior killed romance and I hate you people for it.</p>\n<p>I hate the knowledge that millions of young men cannot hope to ever express love in the purest most beautiful way because you disgusting whores will post it on social media and mock in private.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UF5n!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ac06772-9985-458a-b1b1-6fafd6f3df36_511x680.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oqKl!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b4f3c0d-7ab5-4a27-99ce-f23d3a9fe368_578x680.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Young men lost the ability to express those feelings.

That\u2019s a context where you don\u2019t open at all, in any form, without strong indications of interest. If this was done in an ordinary mixed context, presumably that would be different.</li>\n<li>This is a clear NRN (no reply necessary) opening, which makes it less of a problem than opening moves that require a response, but even outside of the gender imbalance context I wouldn\u2019t call it \u2018romance.\u2019</li>\n<li>You think this thread is bad for the guy who passed her the note?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As in, no one knows who passed this note.

There\u2019s no real social penalty for it anymore.</p>\n<p>If there\u2019s a good chance the other person will flake, it becomes game theoretically rational to mitigate that risk by having extra confirmations or readily available backup plans.</p>\n<p>Gingercap: I kind of got the impression that being too excited about a date is kind of cringe and comes off as desperate.</p>\n<p>Noodle: Ehh when I was dating I made the mistake to get ready for the date only to be stood up or ghosted.

What the rules \u2018should\u2019 be is again not so relevant, nor is \u2018who is at fault\u2019 per se.</p>\n<p>So here are some various thoughts.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you are happy or righteous or similar about being able to cancel the date when they don\u2019t confirm, you shouldn\u2019t have said yes in the first place.</li>\n<li>The flake rate, on all sides, is sufficiently high that the default should now be to confirm on the day of the date. The cost of confirmation is low. In general as the asker it is your job to ensure the date actually happens.</li>\n<li>I can believe that we have reached the point where the flake rate when not getting confirmation is high enough that it is reasonable for the person asked to require confirmation and to treat this as a default dynamic.</li>\n<li>If you require confirmation, ideally you should note that you require confirmation, or better yet proactively ask for it if you don\u2019t get it. But there are selection effect and signaling reasons to not do this. Either way, once you know you\u2019re not going to show, you should explicitly cancel, not silently flake.</li>\n<li>If you don\u2019t say you require confirmation, and don\u2019t show without it, you flaked.</li>\n<li>Flaking is in general extremely poor form and should be treated as a very expensive action in all contexts, romantic or otherwise, especially without notice and especially without apologies.</li>\n<li>If your lack of confirmation causes flaking, that is often favorable selection. If their lack of confirmation causes you to flake, that is also favorable selection.</li>\n<li>If lack of same day confirmation causes flaking on a first date, that is still an unforced error by all involved. In other circumstances, either subsequent dates or non-romantic contexts, this is often not true.</li>\n<li>Confirmation can give both parties an out, so it serves a useful purpose when someone is getting pressured, but it is bad to give people an easy flake out because people will constantly cancel plans of all kinds when they shouldn\u2019t.</li>\n<li>If this is a \u2018test of enthusiasm\u2019 or otherwise phrased or presented in ways similar to the OP then I would consider it a red flag.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019re Single Because You Didn\u2019t Have Your Big Moment At The Prom</h4>\n\n\n<p>My revealed preference at the time was not to go at all, have no real options for going and make no effort to go. Neither of these options was remotely on the table, although I would like to think I would have happily accepted either of them.</p>\n<p>So I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m the best person to judge the options?</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/Romy_Holland/status/1954243499890741347\">Romy</a>: imagine you\u2019re a high school senior and it\u2019s prom season. would you rather go with a 10 who will definitely not have sex with you, or a 7 who definitely will?</p>\n<p>Kip: I chose the no sex option because I didn\u2019t want to have sex yet in high school</p>\n<p>Ronny: lol a 7 who will *definitely* have sex with you is a disturbing option in that case.</p></blockquote>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eTJt!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9ed18da-0a5e-4010-b0c4-0a9ff2924e9b_1032x434.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>I was thinking in terms of \u2018you have no future with either of them, everyone is going to say goodbye and head off to college.\u2019 If there is a real future involved then that should presumably dominate the question either way. As does the question of whether anyone believes in the pairing, including especially the two of you.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019re Single Because Board Games Came Between You</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/tracewoodgrains/status/1903835150175133711\">What does one make of</a> what was intended to be a singles event in which the men ended up playing board games and getting to know each other, while the women talked and got to know each other?</p>\n<blockquote><p>Tracing Woodgrains: dudes rock</p>\n<p>there\u2019s actually a lot to be said about the framing of the paragraph \u2014 the women preferred to talk, the men preferred board games, the women lamented that the men didn\u2019t talk with them bc they didn\u2019t feel like playing board games with the men</p>\n<p>both are good activities!</p>\n<p>Ben Hoffman: This feels like a good example of the sort of information I\u2019d have responded wrongly to, before I learned that if a woman keeps complaining about men doing X, that\u2019s most likely an expression of preference for the sorts of men who do X, not an offer to transact with men who don\u2019t.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The article of course framed this as the guys refusing to interact with the women, rather than both sides choosing distinct activities, and also it seeming still great?</p>\n<p>It seems like a good use of an evening to play board games where I meet new friends, or I sit around and talk and meet new friends, whether or not I am single. We all need more friends. The woman here says she left with potential new friends too.</p>\n<p>It does seem like it should not be a stable equilibrium. Why didn\u2019t any of the women join the board games? Why didn\u2019t any of the men go monopolize all the women? Both seem like highly overdetermined strategies, at least on repeated play, if things aren\u2019t already going great.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019re Single Because You Can\u2019t Dance</h4>\n\n\n<p>Knowing how to dance, especially as a guy, <a href=\"https://x.com/Aella_Girl/status/1945239362406637625\">remains a cheat code</a>.

Not because it\u2019s the only way. But because when you\u2019re young, you\u2019re more adaptable.</p>\n<p>If you both come from good families, they\u2019ll cheer you on.</p>\n<p>You can build something from the ground up, together.</p>\n<p>Love after 30? Absolutely possible.</p>\n<p>But if you\u2019re young and thinking about love, don\u2019t let the world scare you out of it. We\u2019re often told to wait forever and then older generations wonder why the young is no longer finding love.</p>\n<p>When you\u2019re young, school is a great place to meet someone.</p>\n<p>So is church. A party. An event. Through mutual friends. I\u2019d argue even Twitter or Substack would be a better way to find someone than a dating app.</p>\n<p>If you like someone\u2019s mind and values, and also happen to like their photo, it\u2019s perfect.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://brittanyhugoboom.substack.com/p/why-should-men-get-married\">Her blog seems full of other similarly basic pieces of largely good advice</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019re Not Single Anymore</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/kirawontmiss/status/1926342918542905706\">Kira:</a> LMFAOOOO</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SBe9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb896ca03-7e79-413f-8d96-fb109633f54a_1002x1309.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Mason: Honestly, \u201cgirl who gets bull-headed and wears cargo pants when he tells her to wear the dress\u201d and \u201cguy who told her to wear the dress but is amused by the cargo pants\u201d are both lovable types</p>\n<p>Mazel tov, be married 50 years and bicker about the throw pillows on your deathbed</p>\n<p>She\u2019s a terrible match for someone who takes this kind of thing personally, but it doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s marrying that kind of guy</p>\n<p>He looks absolutely thrilled</p>\n<p>Marilyn Maupin: I got yelled at by so many people for saying they\u2019ll be fine since she clearly understands what she did to herself</p>\n<p>Mason: Seriously, as long as she\u2019s laughing at herself instead of doubling down and insisting he\u2019s the jerk for proposing to her in the cargo pants they\u2019re fine.

In extreme cases where lots of residential proxies are cloning every repo they can and making the server calculate absurd diffs between random commit hashes, this results in the opposite of rejoicing.</p>\n        <p>I am not entirely sure what to suggest to users of Anubis that serve git repositories with git-http-backend. My SRE instinct is that the entire model of using fork/exec with CGI is fundamentally broken and the git-http-backend service needs to be its own HTTP server that can run persistently and concurrently handle requests, but that is not something that can be slapped together instantly.</p>\n        <p>Am I missing something really simple that I don't know about?
