\u201cplanets\u201d of kottke.org</h2>\n\n<p>Jason Kottke\u2019s website, <a href=\"https://kottke.org/\">kottke.org</a>, has a sidebar that shows four coloured circles, <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/03/kottkeorg-redesigns-with-2024-vibes#:~:text=Billions%20and%20Billions.\">different for every visitor</a>.\nThere are nearly a trillion possible combinations, which means everyone gets their own unique version of the page.</p>\n\n<figure>\n   <source type=\"image/png\" /> <img alt=\"A web page with black text on a white background, and down the left hand side are four circles showing different textures in a variety of pink/red shades.\" class=\"screenshot\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2025/bookmarks/kottke_1x.png\" width=\"600\" /> \n  <figcaption>\n    I happened to capture a particularly aesthetically pleasing collection of reds and pinks in this preserved snapshot.\n    They add a pop of colour to the page, but they don\u2019t overwhelm it.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>I think this adds a dash of fun whimsy, and I\u2019ve tried adding something similar to my own sites, but it\u2019s easy to get wrong.\nMy experiments in randomness often failed because they lacked constraints \u2013 for example, I\u2019d pick random tint colours, but some combinations were unreadable.\nThe Kottke \u201cplanets\u201d strike a nice balance: the randomness stands out, but it\u2019s reined in so the overall page will always look good.</p>\n\n<p>There are thousands of snapshots of kottke.org in the Wayback Machine, many saved automatically.\nThat means there are unique combinations of circles already archived that have yet to be seen by a person \u2013 frozen moments that may only be seen by a future reader, long after this design has gone.\nI rather like that: a tiny, quiet, time capsule on the web.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"panic\">Physical meets digital on panic.org</h2>\n\n<p>The software company <a href=\"https://panic.com\">Panic</a> has a circular logo: <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Panic_Inc_Logo.svg\">a\u00a0stylised \u201cP\u201d</a> on a two-tone blue background.\nBut for years, if you visited their website, you might see that logo in a different colour, like this:</p>\n\n<figure>\n   <source type=\"image/png\" /> <img alt=\"A screenshot of the Panic blog, with a dark blue P logo in the top left-hand corner.\" class=\"screenshot\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2025/bookmarks/panic_blue_1x.png\" width=\"300\" /> \n   <source type=\"image/png\" /> <img alt=\"A screenshot of the Panic blog, with a red/green P logo in the top left-hand corner.\" class=\"screenshot\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2025/bookmarks/panic_green_1x.png\" width=\"300\" /> \n</figure>\n\n<p>Where did those colours come from?\nThe logo image gets loaded from <code>signserver.panic.com</code>, which makes me think it reflected the current colours of <a href=\"https://panic.com/blog/the-panic-sign/\">the physical sign on their building</a>.\nThey even had a website where anybody could change the colours of the sign (though it\u2019s offline now \u2013 they took the sign down when they moved offices).</p>\n\n<p>I love this detail: a tiny bit of the physical world seeping into the digital.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"circadium\">A Tumblr theme that follows the sun</h2>\n\n<p>Another instance of the physical world affecting the digital comes from one of my <a href=\"https://three--rings.tumblr.com/post/625948601747636224/when-i-was-15-i-spent-a-month-working-on-an\">bookmarked Tumblr posts</a>, which has a remarkable theme <a href=\"https://linthm.tumblr.com/post/626279447390257152/theme-28-circadium-20-yes-sweet-baby-jesus\">Circadium\u00a02.0</a>, made by Tumblr user Laighlin.\nForget a binary switch between light and dark mode, this is a theme that slowly changes the appearance through the entire day.</p>\n\n<p>The background changes colour, stars fade in and out, and the moon and the sun gradually rise and set.\nIt cycles through noon, twilight, and dusk, before starting the same thing over again.\nIt\u2019s hard to describe it in words, so here\u2019s a screen recording <a href=\"https://circadium-theme.tumblr.com/page/3\">of the demo site</a> for a 24\u00a0hour cycle:</p>\n\n<video class=\"screenshot\" loop=\"\" poster=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2025/bookmarks/circadium_loop.png\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2025/bookmarks/circadium_loop.mp4\"></video>\n\n<p>This effect is very subtle, because the appearance is set based on the time you loaded the page, and doesn\u2019t change after that.\nUnless you reload the same page repeatedly, you may even not notice the background is changing.</p>\n\n<p>This is the sort of creativity I love about sites like Tumblr and LiveJournal, where users can <em>really</em> customise the appearance of their sites \u2013 not just pick a profile picture and a tint colour.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"campsanto\">Subtle transitions at Campo Santo</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://blog.camposanto.com/post/162685206999/love-at-first-site-a-few-months-ago-we-got-a\">Campo Santo blog</a> has a more restrained design, but still makes fun use of shifting colours \u2013 the tint colour of the page gradually switches from a reddish orange to brown, to green, to a dark yellow, and back to orange.\nThis tint colour affects multiple elements on the page: the header, the sidebar promo, headings and social media links.</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what it looks like:</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <video class=\"screenshot\" loop=\"\" poster=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2025/bookmarks/campo_santo_loop.png\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2025/bookmarks/campo_santo_loop.mp4\"></video>\n  <figcaption>\n    I so enjoyed <em>Firewatch</em>, and I\u2019m still a little bitter that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFOXIGzdMv8\"><em>In the Valley of Gods</em></a> got <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2019/12/3/20994257/valve-in-the-valley-of-gods-campo-santo-half-life-alyx\">cancelled</a>.\n    I would have loved another first-person exploration game from that team.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Sadly, this animation only lives on in web archives and in memory \u2013 something has broken in the JavaScript that means it no longer works on the live site.\nThe fragility of the web isn\u2019t just entire pages or sites going offline, it\u2019s also the gradual breaking of pages that remain online.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"owltastic\">The hand-drawn aesthetic of Owltastic</h2>\n\n<p>My favourite website is the old design of <a href=\"https://owltastic.com\">Meagan Fisher Couldwell\u2019s</a> website.\nIt has a beautiful, hand-drawn aesthetic, and it\u2019s full of subtle texture and round corners \u2013 no straight lines, no hard edges.\nIt has a soft and gentle appearance, and a friendly owl mascot to boot.</p>\n\n<p>I bookmarked this particular page in 2013, before iOS 7 when loud textures and skeuomorphism were still in fashion \u2013 but unlike many designs from that era which now look dated, I think this site still looks good today.</p>\n\n<figure>\n   <source type=\"image/png\" /> <img alt=\"Screenshot of a website with a light turquoise background, with various similar shades of teal, with a light brown as an accent colour. In the top left is a hand-drawn illustration of an owl, which is smiling and gesturing towards an article titled \u2018Writign and publishing are important\u2019.\" class=\"screenshot\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2025/bookmarks/owltastic_1x.png\" width=\"600\" /> \n  <figcaption>\n    I just know that owl and I would be friends.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Owltastic is the first site I remember seeing and thinking \u201cwow\u201d, and wanting to build something that looked that good.\nMeagan has since redesigned her site, but I have a lot of nostalgia for that hand-drawn look.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 id=\"final_thoughts\">Final thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>A lot of the creativity has been squeezed out of the web.\nI\u2019ve been working on a separate social media archiving project recently, and it\u2019s depressing how many sites look essentially the same \u2013 black sans serif text on a white background.\n(Many of them even use the default system font, because heaven forbid a site have <em>any</em> personality.)</p>\n\n<p>Going through my bookmarks has been a fun reminder that the web is still a creative, colourful, and diverse space \u2013 the variety is there, even if it\u2019s getting harder to find.\nLots of people are doing interesting stuff on the web, and my bookmarks are a way to remember and celebrate that.</p>\n\n<p>Revamping the way I organise my bookmarks has taken a lot of work, but I\u2019m so pleased with the result.\nNow I have a list of my most important web pages in an open format, saved locally, with an archived copy of each page as well.\nI can browse them in a simple web interface, and see every page as I remember it, even if the original website has disappeared.</p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t like making predictions, but this feels like a system that should last a long time.\nThere are no third-party dependencies, nothing that will need upgrading, no external service that could be abandoned or enshittified.\nI feel like I could manage my bookmarks this way for the rest of my life \u2013 stay tuned to see if that holds true!</p>\n\n<p>Writing this four-part series has been the capstone to this year-long project.\nI had a lot of time to think about bookmarks and web archiving, and I didn\u2019t want those thoughts to disappear.\nI hope you\u2019ve enjoyed it, and that I\u2019ve given you some new ideas.\nThank you for reading this far.</p>\n\n<p>My favourite parts of the web are the spaces where people share interesting ideas.\nThis mini-series \u2013 and this entire blog \u2013 is my contribution to that collective work.</p>\n\n\n    <p>[If the formatting of this post looks odd in your feed reader, <a href=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2025/my-favourite-websites/\">visit the original article</a>]</p>"

It's been over a year since I created <a href=\"https://omakub.org/\">Omakub</a> to smooth out my own exit path from macOS to Linux, and in the process, helped thousands of others enjoy a beautiful, preconfigured, and relatively familiar desktop experience with Ubuntu. And I continue to think this is an excellent choice for Linux, especially for first-time Mac and Windows defectors.<br /><br /></div><div>But this weekend, I just happened to be home alone, and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CP_9-jCV6A\">hype</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzUu77RZGSE\">around</a> Arch + Hyprland got the better of me. While Ubuntu is all about being a friendly place for newcomers to Linux, Arch + Hyprland is the exact opposite: It's Linux on hard mode!&nbsp;</div><div><br />At least that's the reputation, and there's certainly something to that. The Arch ISO literally just dumps you into a terminal with scarcely any direction. Just getting on the Wi-Fi requires learning the arcane command-line options for the iwctl terminal configurator.</div><div><br />But besides iwctl, it's actually not that bad anymore. We now have a cheat code for installing Arch in the form of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9nKjTfDHLA\">archinstall</a>. It's a terminal interface for getting all the bits like picking a disk and creating the first user done in the correct order, without having to set aside an entire evening just to get the OS installed. So it didn't take long to get Arch up and running.<br /><br /></div><div>That doesn't get you much further, though! By default, Arch is about as minimal as it gets. There's no default graphical interface. There are no niceties. Not even wget or curl by default! It really is just a bare-bones installation of Linux.</div><div><br />But on the other hand, Arch is blessed with the <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository\">AUR</a> \u2014 a Wikipedia-style, community-maintained package management system that seems to have literally every piece of software ever released on Linux, and always in the latest version.</div><div><br />A quarter of Omakub is trying to work around the fact that helpful tools like Alacritty or LazyGit or whatever rarely have official packages for Ubuntu, so you're left doing a lot of manual scripting to get everything a developer would want from a modern Linux setup. Not so with the AUR!</div><div><br />So that's Arch. But Hyprland is even more hilarious. It's a tiling window manager with something as rare in the Linux world as a keen focus on aesthetics! It looks like it was written by visual artists rather than neckbeards. And it's at the core of <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/top/?t=all\">the modern r/unixporn Linux ricing subculture</a>.<br /><br /></div><div>That's not the funny part, though. The funny part is how ridiculously atomized the entire thing is. Hyprland comes with absolutely nothing out of the box. No login screen, no menu bar, no notification system, no file manager, no visual settings application. Just a text-based configuration file, a wiki, and an outline on a map for how to design your own adventure.</div><div><br />This means that if you're interested in running Hyprland, and you intend to set it all up from scratch, you're probably signing up for at least a good 10+ hours \u2014 just to install and configure everything! Now, there are some precompiled setup scripts out there already, but most of them still require you to do a ton of manual legwork before you reach that beautiful summit of a complete system.<br /><br /></div><div>So while the downside of Arch + Hyprland is that literally every last detail requires you to make a choice and a config file to move on, it's also its upside: you can change EVERYTHING! And the core window tiling magic of Hyprland is one of the most intoxicating ways of using a computer that I've ever experienced. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOGM0uHCDFk\">It looks amazing</a>; it feels amazing (if you prefer using a keyboard instead of a mouse!).</div><div><br />I've poured hours and hours into this quest over the weekend, and yet I'm still not even done with my first Arch + Hyprland build! My login screen looks like shit. I haven't decided on a final menu bar configuration. But what is working \u2014 the basic tiling flow and look \u2014 is so nice that the inspiration keeps driving the project forward.<br /><br /></div><div>Which, of course, I've already decided to codify. I'm not going through all this work to set up a beautiful, preconfigured, fully-functional, out-of-the-box Arch + Hyprland combo and then not share it with anyone who's curious (and might not have 10\u201320 hours for this kind of side quest available in their schedule).

tracking features.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"The-point-is-to-change-behaviours\">\n<h2><a class=\"heading-ref\" href=\"https://www.jonashietala.se/#The-point-is-to-change-behaviours\">The point is to change behaviours</a></h2>\n<p>While it\u2019s fun to play with new things,\nthe main point of these smart devices is to (hopefully) help me change my behaviours in a positive way.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if the device is super accurate or produces the most beautiful graphs God has created;\nif it doesn\u2019t help me do things differently then the device is a failure.</p>\n<p>Here are two examples:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>My first Fitbit smartband was great.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s true that it was quite limited in what it could do,\nthe tracking of steps/calories/steps/etc was wildly inaccurate,\nand it disconnected from my phone <em>all the time</em> making notifications completely unreliable.</p>\n<p>However, it presented the daily steps/calories/steps as pretty bars on the screen\u2014bars that I should fill over the course of the day\u2014and that caused me to move more than I\u2019d have done otherwise.</p>\n<p>(This is a feature in most smartwatches today but nothing I\u2019ve tried captured the feeling as well as my very first Fitbit device.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/884585/\">Garmin Instinct</a> is useful, but not as a fitness or health device.</p>\n<p>I think the watch is very nice;\nit\u2019s got a fantastic battery life,\nit\u2019s not bothering me when I sleep,\nI don\u2019t have to reach for my phone to see if I have any notifications,\nand the flashlight is <em>amazing</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It [the flashlight] is just super effin\u2019 functional and useful day-to-day, with just as much utility as the flashlight on your phone (if not more, since your hands are still free).</p>\n<p></p>\n<footer><span class=\"author\"><a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/05/flashlight-multiband-everyone.html\">DCRainmaker</a>\n</span></footer>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Garmin also has lots of various measurements (and with much more accuracy than my old Fitbit);\nI can see the daily steps;\nI can follow how my \u201cbody battery\u201d is doing;\nI can track walks or runs very well (although I don\u2019t run);\nand I can follow my stress and heart rate throughout the day\u2026</p>\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t <em>do</em> anything for me.\nI have all these bars and graphs and circles on the watch that I should fill to meet my daily step count for example\u2026 But I just don\u2019t.\nMaybe my neanderthal brain needs more colors or something.</p>\n<p>The Garmin app is also not designed in a way to help me get motivated.\nMaybe it\u2019s more geared towards runners\nor athletes that already train hard every day,\ninstead of middle-aged programmers who need that extra push to get out there?</p>\n<p>For whatever reason, as a device to improve my fitness and health, the Garmin is a failure.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n<section id=\"Why-I-left-Whoop-last-year\">\n<h2><a class=\"heading-ref\"

                "<p>In most places, most areas of life are dominated either by competition between multiple units, or by the governance of a single organization. Of course governments have usually themselves faced competition at larger scales, and governance often makes use of internal competition at smaller scales.</p><p>A key social and political question has long been: how much of society shall governments run? In the ancient world, the answer was mostly: only a small part. There were a few experiments with more totalitarian governance, such as in ancient Egypt and China, but mostly government was limited. Also, most private orgs were quite small, and so needed little only modest governance.</p><p>We can evaluate governance by three criteria: preference, effectiveness, and adaptiveness. How much do people just like to have more government, all else equal, how effective is government as solving the areas and problems it is assigned compared to the competitive alternative, and how adaptive is the resulting society (in the standard biological sense).</p><p>Effectiveness and adaptiveness of governance will depend on demand and supply factors. How severe are the market failure and other coordination problems for which governance seems especially appropriate, and how competent are the governance mechanisms available to deal with such problems?</p><p>Plausibly most societies were pretty adaptive until a few centuries ago, and so typical governance levels were roughly adaptive. And that is plausibly because governance was then not very competent at dealing with most social areas, compared to competition. Places with more severe coordination problems, like those arising from large scale irrigation opportunities in ancient Egypt and China, tended to have more governance.</p><p>In the last few centuries the world has greatly increase its average governance levels, having governments do more to manage more areas of life, and at larger spatial scales. Non-government orgs have also greatly increased their scales. In fact, this org scale increase is plausibly THE great change of the industrial era, with other changes resulting more from this key change.</p><p>One plausible cause of this change is a great increase in the competence of governance, compared to competition. Other possible causes include an increase in the preference for governance, due to a drift to forager attitudes, and an increase in the severity of coordination problems, due to larger scales of war, production, trade, and culture.</p><p>I&#8217;m a tenured professor at GMU econ, which is famously libertarian, and with my colleagues I do in fact tend to think that we have too much government today, even in the US. But I&#8217;m not an axiomatic libertarian, using primarily moral reasons. My stance has been more about seeing both less severe coordination problems, and less competent existing governance mechanisms.</p><p>However, I also happen to be the proud inventor of a new governance mechanism, futarchy, that promises to be vastly more competent that prior mechanisms. And so I have to admit that if this mechanism is as successful as I hope, we&#8217;d then get a lot more governance:</p><blockquote><p>In such a world orgs should be larger, as their more effective governance reduces the scale diseconomies that limit org sizes today. Governments and nonprofits may also encompass more social activity, if they can learn to adopt simple robust futarchy outcome measures. This plausibly cuts their disadvantages relative to for profit orgs today. We might well even get bigger national alliances, or even a world government. (<a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/futarchy-futurism\">More</a>)</p></blockquote><p>A key question then is: to what purposes would this new stronger governance be directed? I&#8217;ve <a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/futarchy-futurism\">hoped</a> that we could use it to solve our big key problem of <a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/our-big-oops?utm_source=publication-search\">cultural drift</a>, and in fact I can&#8217;t actually think of a more promising solution to that problem. But I have to admit that most societies may in fact <a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/seek-what-outcomes-via-futarchy\">direct</a> it to other purposes.</p><p>In the past, weak governance may actually have been a big reason why we&#8217;ve had so much competition, which has induced so much cultural evolution. Stronger governance could let places function with much less competition, which then results in much less adaptive cultural evolution. Which would then allow those cultures to drift even worse into dysfunction.</p><p>So if our world soon acquires a much more competent form of governance, we might then suffer a new much larger <em>variance</em> in adaptability. Places where this governance is directed toward maladaptive goals would become more maladaptive even faster, while places where this new power is directed toward adaptive goals could become far more adaptive, reversing the decay of prior cultural drift. </p><p>Overall, in the long run, this variance would be highly adaptive of course. But there might be quite painful transition period.</p>"
