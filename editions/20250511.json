And it would be a bit harder to judge how much to reward those who propose options that markets approve.</p><p>But the biggest problem is likely to be <a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/decision-selection-bias\">decision selection biases</a>. However, those can be mostly eliminated if decision makers will agree to two key conditions:</p><p><strong>A)</strong> Declare at time T1 that the decision time T5 will fall within a particular period [T3,T6], with price averages over [T2,T5] offered as advice. The shorter is duration T6-T3 and the longer is T2-T1 the better, though 48 and 24 hours seem sufficient.</p><p><strong>B) </strong>Allow and encourage key decision makers and advisors who have access to inside info relevant to the decision to trade in the markets during [T1,T5]. Or at least allow associates of theirs to whom they can reveal such info.</p><p>Decision selection bias is caused by fears of traders at T4 that the decision will be made at T5 based on info unavailable them at T4. Including key informed parties should ensure that they reveal their info to the markets at some point, subsidizing to ensure these markers are thicker during [T1,T2] than [T2,T5] should induce all to reveal what they know by T2, and a short duration [T2,T6] should insure that little new info appears during that period. (Manipulation attempts would thicken markets during [T2,T6]; make the extra [T1,T2] subsidy big enough to compensate.)</p><p>Yes, another approach is to get executives to make decisions randomly some small X% of the time, and make decision markets condition on such random decisions. Alas, I fear that will be seen as a much bigger ask. </p>"

We already <em>loosely</em> followed the ideas of an architectural advice process (from this <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/articles/scaling-architecture-conversationally.html\">2021 article</a> by the same Andrew Harmel-Law), but in practice we found that internal tech spec and architecture decision record (ADR) authors tended to exclusively share their documents locally within their team rather than more widely.</p> <p>As we asked authors why they preferred sharing locally, the most common answer was that they got enough feedback from their team that they didn&rsquo;t want to pay the time overhead of sharing widely. The wider feedback wasn&rsquo;t necessarily bad or combative. It just wasn&rsquo;t good enough to compensate for the additional time it cost to process. This made sense from the authors&rsquo; perspectives, but didn&rsquo;t work well for me from the executive perspective, as I was seeing teams make misaligned decisions due to lack of cross-team communication.</p> <p>As one step in reducing the overhead of sharing documents widely, I wrote up and shared this recommended process for providing feedback on documents:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Before starting, remember that the goal of providing feedback on a document is to help the author.
