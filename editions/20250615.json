                "<p>I was lying on the 22nd floor of The Standard<sup id=\"fnref-5165-1\"><a class=\"jetpack-footnote\" href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/feed/#fn-5165-1\" title=\"Read footnote.\">1</a></sup> I was three martinis up the Hudson and surfing YouTube when the new Superman trailer dropped. This one:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This trailer hit me hard. The prior Superman, as we&#8217;ll read about in a moment, was a watered-down meh version of the hero. This brand-new take on my favorite hero introduced Henry Cavill and a completely new theme song, which I will now explain was a really big deal.</p>\n<h2>Two Themes</h2>\n<p>Including the forthcoming Superman from James Gunn, we have 10 Superman movies since the first was released in 1978. Here&#8217;s your first fun fact: there are only two theme songs in all of those movies.</p>\n<h2>Superman (1978)</h2>\n<p>Released the year after Star Wars, Superman helped cement the launch of the modern blockbuster era that George Lucas had begun. The John William&#8217;s theme has two parts that you can&#8217;t unhear: the main fanfare and then the unforgettable march.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>John Williams, my friends, is at the top of his game. It&#8217;s a great movie. In the pre-CGI world, I believed Superman could fly, but like Star Wars before it, the massive main theme elevates the whole picture.</p>\n<h2>Superman II (1980)</h2>\n<p>Cracks in the Superman franchise appeared in an OK sequel. Richard Donner, the director of the first movie, shot much of the second movie during the first. He had creative differences with producers and was fired. Major reshoots occurred to get the new Director his director credit, and the result was a semi-chopped-together kind&#8217;a OK film.</p>\n<p>The theme? 100% John Williams.</p>\n<h2>Superman III (1983) &amp; Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987)</h2>\n<p>Superman III was awful. Superman IV was a please-make-it-stop situation. The Salkinds, the producers, proved definitively that Richard Donner was the reason the first movie flew.</p>\n<p>The theme for both? 100% John Williams. Still.</p>\n<h2>Superman Returns (2006)</h2>\n<p>The last two movies were so bad that they waited almost a decade before releasing another movie. The last two movies were <strong>so bad</strong> that Superman Returns was written to ignore Superman III and IV. It was set after the events of the second film. Superman had spent five years in space doing\u2026 something, and now he returns.</p>\n<p>Director Bryan Singer was aiming for a homage, but ended up with a two-and-a-half-hour confusing mess. Luthor was building an island\u2026 out of kryptonite? What? Superman is a deadbeat Dad? The good news is that the main theme is a lightly polished version of the original John Williams score.</p>\n<p>The score didn&#8217;t help. The movie bombed, and we didn&#8217;t see Superman again on the big screen for another seven years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Man of Steel (2013)</h2>\n<p>This is the movie that dared to introduce a new theme:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Given the multi-decade dominance of the Williams theme, I was surprised, like you, when I heard a new main theme for Man of Steel. There&#8217;s no fanfare in the Zimmer theme. It builds slowly, it&#8217;s less complex, but when the hero arrives, you hear it. Zimmer famously hired the world&#8217;s best drummers to bang out the percussion parts of this work of art.</p>\n<p>I asked Spotify how many times I&#8217;ve listened to this theme song since 2013, and Spotify told me, &#8220;Bro. You don&#8217;t want to know.&#8221;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The movie? Zack Snyder. What are you going to do\u2026</p>\n<h2>Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), Justice League (2017), Zach Snyder&#8217;s Justice League (2021)</h2>\n<p>These mostly forgettable visual feasts did not advance either theme, other than incorporating bits and pieces of both William&#8217;s score and Zimmer&#8217;s score into an otherwise unremarkable larger score. These movies were peak DC losing its way. Wonder Woman was fantastic, and Aquaman was promising, but the movies that combined the heroes lost track of the characters&#8217; hearts. They focused on spectacle rather than genuinely cared for stories.</p>\n<h2>Superman (2025)</h2>\n<p>This article exists because of the recent introduction of this movie&#8217;s theme. The stakes could not be higher for James Gunn, who reboots (again) the DC Universe with the launch of his Superman. His increasingly compelling trailers showcase Gunn&#8217;s signature style. It&#8217;s a group of oddballs with a lot of feelings. Krypto is there, and he&#8217;s a mutt? Whole thing looks\u2026 busy and kind&#8217;a weird? But, remember, this is the same guy who made you fall in love with a raccoon and his tree sidekick. We&#8217;ll see.</p>\n<p>But we don&#8217;t have to wait on the theme.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s smart. We&#8217;ve got the march, we&#8217;ve got the heroic build, and then we&#8217;ve got the five defining notes from the original William&#8217;s theme. BOOM. Homage. Big theme swing for a big movie. Much luck, Mr. Gunn<sup id=\"fnref-5165-2\"><a class=\"jetpack-footnote\" href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/feed/#fn-5165-2\" title=\"Read footnote.\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<h2>The Big Red W</h2>\n<p>I wrote <a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/archives/i-choose-superman/\">this piece</a> lying on the bed semi-martini-drunk, playing the first Man of Steel theme on repeat. At the time, I wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  My family loves Superman because he is an unrealistic and impossible creature. We know that. We know he sets an impossible bar, but we need that bar because that is how we dream big, that is how we aspire to something great, and that is why we choose hope.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Across the Hudson from The Standard is the W hotel in New Jersey. At the top of the hotel is a big red illuminated W. I&#8217;ve stayed at the hotel many times. Two different start-ups had me flying to New York frequently, and I always asked for a river-facing view because all I wanted to do was have a couple of drinks and stare at that big red W.</p>\n<p>Great Gatsby, right? He&#8217;s staring across the sound at the green light because that&#8217;s her. Daisy. Tragic optimism. That&#8217;s me. Tragically optimistic. Tragically hopeful. Endlessly.</p>\n<p>My heroes are strong, consistent, and kind. Their themes loudly declare our optimism.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-5165-1\">\nYeah, the same place I met that <a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-hotel-giraffe/\">giraffe</a>&#160;<a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/feed/#fnref-5165-1\" title=\"Return to main content.\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-5165-2\">\nHere&#8217;s a link to all of the <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/76DphtwLah1jCxIbqH6L3v?si=156f6678834342f8\">themes</a>.&#160;<a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/feed/#fnref-5165-2\" title=\"Return to main content.\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"

I'd love to do it full time, but that's not financially in the cards yet. I made Anubis. Anubis is a web AI firewall utility that stops the bots from taking out your website. It's basically the Cloudflare &quot;Are you a bot?&quot; page, but self-hostable.</p>\n        <figure class=\"xeblog-slides-fluff\"><source type=\"image/avif\" /><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"A captcha component.\" src=\"hhttps://files.xeiaso.net/talks/2025/bsdcan-anubis/003.jpg\" /><figcaption>A captcha component.</figcaption></figure>\n        <p>And without this. Scrapers have CAPTCHA solvers built in. These CAPTCHA solvers are effectively APIs that just have underpaid third world humans in the loop, and it's just kind of bad and horrible.</p>\n        <figure class=\"xeblog-slides-fluff\"><source type=\"image/avif\" /><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"A captcha component.\" src=\"hhttps://files.xeiaso.net/talks/2025/bsdcan-anubis/004.jpg\" /><figcaption>A captcha component.</figcaption></figure>\n        <p>So Anubis is an uncaptcha. It uses features of your browser to automate a lot of the work that a CAPTCHA would, and right now the main implementation is by having it run a bunch of cryptographic math with JavaScript to prove that you can run JavaScript in a way that can be validated on the server. I'm working on obviating that because surprisingly many people get very angry about having to run JavaScript, but it's within the cards.</p>\n        <figure class=\"xeblog-slides-fluff\"><source type=\"image/avif\" /><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"A captcha component.\" src=\"hhttps://files.xeiaso.net/talks/2025/bsdcan-anubis/005.jpg\" /><figcaption>A captcha component.</figcaption></figure>\n        <p>Anubis is open source software written in Go. It's on GitHub. It's got like eight kilostars. It works on any stack that lets you run more than one program. We have examples for Nginx, Caddy, Apache, and Kubernetes.</p>\n        <figure class=\"xeblog-slides-fluff\"><source type=\"image/avif\" /><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"A slide showing the Repology version history graph for Anubis.\" src=\"hhttps://files.xeiaso.net/talks/2025/bsdcan-anubis/007.jpg\" /><figcaption>A slide showing the Repology version history graph for Anubis.</figcaption></figure>\n        <p>It's in your package repos.

Why does Anubis exist?</p>\n        <figure class=\"xeblog-slides-fluff\"><source type=\"image/avif\" /><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"The Amazon logo using a flamethrower to burninate my Gitea server.\" src=\"hhttps://files.xeiaso.net/talks/2025/bsdcan-anubis/009.jpg\" /><figcaption>The Amazon logo using a flamethrower to burninate my Gitea server.</figcaption></figure>\n        <p>Well, this happened. I have a Git server for my own private evil plans, and Amazon's crawler discovered it through TLS certificate transparency logs and decided to unleash the hammer of God. And that happened. They had the flamethrower of requests just burning down my poor server, and it was really annoying because I was trying to do something and it just didn't work. Also helps if you don't schedule your storage on rotational drives.</p>\n        <figure class=\"xeblog-slides-fluff\"><source type=\"image/avif\" /><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"A slide showing a hilarious number of logos of organizations that deploy Anubis.\" src=\"hhttps://files.xeiaso.net/talks/2025/bsdcan-anubis/010.jpg\" /><figcaption>A slide showing a hilarious number of logos of organizations that deploy Anubis.</figcaption></figure>\n        <p>But I published it on GitHub, and like four months later, look at all these logos. There's more logos that I forgot to put on here and will be in the version on my website. But like, yeah, it's used by FreeBSD, NetBSD, Haiku, GNOME, FFmpeg, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. Honestly, seeing UNESCO just through a random DuckDuckGo search made me think, huh, maybe this is an actual problem. And like any good problem, it's a hard problem.</p>\n        <figure class=\"xeblog-slides-fluff\"><source type=\"image/avif\" /><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"A screenshot of Pale Moon passing the bot detection check.\" src=\"hhttps://files.xeiaso.net/talks/2025/bsdcan-anubis/012.jpg\" /><figcaption>A screenshot of Pale Moon passing the bot detection check.</figcaption></figure>\n        <p>How do you tell if any request is coming from a browser?</p>\n        <p>This screenshot right here uses Pale Moon, which is a known problem child in terms of bot detection services and something that I actively do test against to make sure that it works. But how do you know if any given request is coming from a browser?</p>\n        <p>It\u2019s very hard, and I have been trying to find ways to do it better. The problem is, in order to know what good browsers look like, you have to know what bad scrapers look like. And the great news is that scrapers look like browsers, asterisk. So you have to find other ways, like behaviors or third-party or like third-order side effects. It\u2019s a huge pain.</p>\n        <figure class=\"xeblog-slides-fluff\"><source type=\"image/avif\" /><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"A list of fingerprinting methods that I've been trying including JA4, JA3N, JA4H, HTTP/2 fingerprinting, THR1, and if the client executes JS.\" src=\"hhttps://files.xeiaso.net/talks/2025/bsdcan-anubis/015.jpg\" /><figcaption>A list of fingerprinting methods that I've been trying including JA4, JA3N, JA4H, HTTP/2 fingerprinting, THR1, and if the client executes JS.</figcaption></figure>\n        <p>So as a result, I'm trying a bunch of fingerprinting methods. These are a lot of the fingerprints that I've listed here, like JA4, JA3N are all based on the TLS information that you send to every website, whether you want to or not, because that's how security works. I'm trying to do stuff based on HTTP requests or the HTTP2 packets that you send to the server, which you have to do in order for things to work. And I'm falling back to, can you run JavaScript, lol?</p>\n        <figure class=\"xeblog-slides-fluff\"><source type=\"image/avif\" /><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"A list of things I want to try in the future.\" src=\"hhttps://files.xeiaso.net/talks/2025/bsdcan-anubis/016.jpg\" /><figcaption>A list of things I want to try in the future.</figcaption></figure>\n        <p>So in terms of things I want to do next, obviously, I want to do better testing on BSD. Right now my testing is: does it compile? And because I've written it in Go without Cgo, that answer is yes. I want to build binary packages for BSDs, because even though I think it's better suited by downstream ports and stuff, I still want to have those packages as an option.</p>\n        <p>I want to do a hosted option like Cloudflare, because some people just don't want to run Anubis but want to run Anubis. I want to do system load-based thresholds, so it only kicks in as it is aggressive when things are actively on fire. I want to have better NoJS support, which will include every way to tell something as a browser without JavaScript in ways that make you read all of the specs and start having an existential breakdown. I want to do stuff with WebAssembly on the server, because I've always wanted to see how that would blow up in prod. I want to do an IP reputation database, Kubernetes stuff, end-to-end testing doesn't suck.</p>\n        <p>And finally, there's one of the contributors that I really want to hire, but I can't afford to yet, so I'd love to when I can.</p>\n        <figure class=\"xeblog-slides-fluff\"><source type=\"image/avif\" /><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"If you want to sabotage Anubis, make sure Final Fantasy 14 stays up.\" src=\"hhttps://files.xeiaso.net/talks/2025/bsdcan-anubis/017.jpg\" /><figcaption>If you want to sabotage Anubis, make sure Final Fantasy 14 stays up.</figcaption></figure>\n        <p>Also, if you work at an AI company, I know AI companies follow me.

That\u2019s gnome, that's wine, that's dolphin, that's the Linux kernel, that's ScummVM, that's FreeCAD, and UNESCO on the same slide. What other timeline could we have?</p>\n        <p>This 2025 has been wild.</p>\n        <blockquote>\n        <p>So how are your feelings? Because you\u2019re basically trying to solve not a technical problem, but actually it\u2019s more of a problem of society. Do you think it is winnable that way, or do we have to fight this problem in another way and make people, well, smarter is probably the wrong word.</p>\n        </blockquote>\n        <p>I am not sure what the end game is for this. I started out developing it for, I want my Git server to stay up. Then gnome started using it. And then it became a thing. I put it under the GitHub org of a satirical startup that I made up for satire about the tech industry. And now that has a market in education.</p>\n        <p>I want to make this into a web application firewall that can potentially survive the AI bubble bursting. Because right now the AI bubble bursting is the biggest threat to the business, as it were. So a lot of it is figuring out how to pivot and do that. I've also made a build tool called Yeet that uses JavaScript to build RPM packages. Yes, there is a world where that does make sense. It's a lot of complicated problems. And there are a lot of social problems.</p>\n        <p>But if you\u2019re writing a scraper, don't. Like seriously, there is enough scraping traffic already. Use Common Crawl.
