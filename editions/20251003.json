However, instead of feeling frustrated (okay, I did feel a bit frustrated at first) I had a bright idea to turn this apparent negative into a positive.</p>\n<p>I created two pages with the following titles and the appropriate subtitles to get indexed as a pirate-able version of JustSketchMe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://justsketch.me/justsketchme-crack-full-2021-skidrow/\" target=\"_blank\">JustSketchMe Crack Full 2021 22.0.1.73</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://justsketch.me/justsketchme-apk-mirror-free/\" target=\"_blank\">JustSketchMe APK Mirror FULL 2.2.2021</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"justsketchme-1664202109\" src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman/justsketchme-1664202109.webp\" /></p>\n<p>These pages rank as the first result on Google for the relevant search terms. Then on the page itself I tongue-in-cheek call out the potential pirate. I then acknowledge that we're in financially trying times and give them a discount code.</p>\n<p>And you know what?</p>\n<p>That discount code is the most used discount code on JustSketchMe! By far! No YouTube sponsor, nor Black Friday special even comes close.</p>\n<p>In some ways this is taking advantage of a good search term. In others it's showing empathy and adding delight, creating a positive incentive to purchase to someone who otherwise wouldn't have.</p>\n<p>The discount code is <strong>PIRACYKILLS</strong>.

                "<p>OpenAI gave us two very different Sora releases. <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/sora-2/\">Here is the official announcement</a>.</p>\n<p>The part where they gave us a new and improved video generator? Great, love it.</p>\n<p>The part where they gave us a new social network dedicated purely to short form AI videos? Not great, Bob. Don\u2019t be evil.</p>\n<p>OpenAI is claiming they are making their social network with an endless scroll of 10-second AI videos the Actively Good, pro-human version of The Big Bright Screen Slop Machine, that helps you achieve your goals and can be easily customized and favors connection and so on. I am deeply skeptical.</p>\n<div>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-24763\"></span>\n\n\n</div>\n<p>They also took a bold copyright stance, with that stance being, well, not quite \u2018f*** you,\u2019 but kind of close? You are welcome to start flagging individual videos. Or you can complain to them more generally about your characters and they say they can \u2018work with you,\u2019 which they clearly do in some cases, but the details are unclear.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HVejEB5uVk\">It\u2019s a bold strategy, Cotton. Let\u2019s see if it pays off for em.</a></p>\n<p>As opposed to their deepfake rule for public figures, which is a highly reasonable opt-in rule where they need to give their permission.</p>\n<p>Thus, a post in three acts.</p>\n<p>You can access Sora either at <a href=\"http://Sora.com\">Sora.com</a> or via the Sora iPhone app. You need an invite to be part of the new social network, because that\u2019s how the cool kids get you excited for a new app these days.</p>\n<p>I am going mostly off reports of others but was also able to get access.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Act 1: Sora 2, The Producer of Ten Second Videos</h4>\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a good <a href=\"https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1973075423488803059\">video</a> generation model, sir. Quite excellent, even. I\u2019m very impressed.</p>\n<p>It is not yet in the API, but it will be soon.</p>\n<p>As always, all official examples you see will be heavily cherry picked. Assume these are, within the context in question, the best Sora 2 can do.</p>\n<p>Those you see on social media from other sources, or on the Sora app, are still heavily selected in various ways. Usually they are the coolest, funniest and best creations, but also they are the creations that most most blatantly violate copyright, or are the most violent or sexual or otherwise might be unwise to create, or simply have the most hilarious fails. They\u2019re not a representative sample.</p>\n<p>When I tried creating a few things, it was still impressive, but as you\u2019d expect it doesn\u2019t nail the whole thing reliably or anything like that, and it doesn\u2019t always fully follow instructions. I also got a content violation for \u2018a time lapse of a Dyson sphere being built set to uplifting music.\u2019</p>\n<p>It is also easy to not appreciate how much progress is being made, or that previously difficult problems are being solved, because where there aren\u2019t problems the lack of problems, and the previous failures, become invisible.</p>\n<p>Netflix and Meta stock were each down a few percent, presumably on the news.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Big Talk</h4>\n\n\n<p>Sora 2 claims to be a big update on several fronts simultaneously:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Able to handle movements impossible for previous models.</li>\n<li>Much better adherence to the laws of physics.</li>\n<li>In particular, no longer \u2018overoptimistic,\u2019 meaning it won\u2019t break physics to make the desired outcome happen, instead events will unfold naturally.</li>\n<li>Strongly controllability, ability to follow intricate instructions.</li>\n<li>Excels at styles, including realistic, cinematic, claymation and anime.</li>\n<li>Creates sophisticated soundscapes and talk to match the video.</li>\n<li>Insert any person, animal or object into any video.</li>\n<li>You can, in particular, upload yourself via your camera.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That\u2019s all very cool. <a href=\"https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1973143641490334133\">The sample videos</a> show impressive command of physics.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/GabrielPeterss4/status/1973071380842229781\">Gabriel Peterss offers this demonstration video.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/gallabytes/status/1973202645285495229\">Gallabytes gets his horse riding an astronaut</a>.</p>\n<p>Based on reactions so far, they seem to be delivering on all of it.</p>\n<p>They are also \u2018responsibly\u2019 launching a new social iOS app called Sora where you can share all these generated videos. Oh no. Hold that thought until Act 3.</p>\n<p>The talk is even bigger in terms of the predicted impact and reception.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1973072672683684239\">Sam Altman:</a> Excited to launch Sora 2! Video models have come a long way; this is a tremendous research achievement.</p>\n<p>Sora is also the most fun I\u2019ve had with a new product in a long time. The iOS app is available in the App Store in the US and Canada; we will expand quickly.</p>\n<p>I did not expect such fun dynamics to emerge from being able to \u201cput yourself and your friends in videos\u201d but I encourage you to check it out!</p>\n<p>ChatGPT Pro subscribers can generate with Sora 2 Pro.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://This feels to many of us like the \u201cChatGPT for creativity\u201d moment, and it feels fun and new. There is something great about making it really easy and fast to go from idea to result, and the new social dynamics that emerge.\">This feels to many of us</a> like the \u201cChatGPT for creativity\u201d moment, and it feels fun and new. There is something great about making it really easy and fast to go from idea to result, and the new social dynamics that emerge.</p>\n<p>Creativity could be about to go through a Cambrian explosion, and along with it, the quality of art and entertainment can drastically increase. Even in the very early days of playing with Sora, it\u2019s been striking to many of us how open the playing field suddenly feels.</p>\n<p>In particular, the ability to put yourself and your friends into a video\u2014the team worked very hard on character consistency\u2014with the cameo feature is something we have really enjoyed during testing, and is to many of us a surprisingly compelling new way to connect.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I would take the other side of that bet. I am not here for it.</p>\n<p>But hold that thought.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Failures of Physics</h4>\n\n\n<p>The physics engine of Sora 2 is remarkably good. As Sora head Bill Peebles points out here in a fun video, <a href=\"https://x.com/billpeeb/status/1973125136263029196\">often what happens is the internal agent messes up but the laws of physics hold</a>.</p>\n<p>It does still fail in ways that can look embarrassing. For example, here we have it successfully having a ball respond to gravity when the ball is white, then <a href=\"https://x.com/ChaseBrowe32432/status/1973114795617558685\">have it all go wrong when the ball is red.</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/1973160458422198595\">Teortaxes attributes slow motion to inability to otherwise model physics</a> properly in many cases.</p>\n<p>So no, this is not a full perfect physics engine, but that is now the standard by which we are judging video generation. The horse can talk, except it needs to fix its accent.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fun With Media Generation</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/sjgadler/status/1973528206918688971\">Solo</a>: I asked Sora 2 to create a 90s Toy Ad of Epstein\u2019s Island.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sora does a good job creating exactly what you would want a video generation tool to do here. It\u2019s speech, people should be able to say and make things.</p>\n<p>OpenAI is currently doing a good job, by all reports, of not allowing images of real people in its videos without explicit consent, so they are if anything being overly cautious about avoiding deepfake problems. Some rivals will presumably be far less scrupulous here. There are big copyright and related issues around creation of derivative works of fiction, but that\u2019s a very different problem.</p>\n<p>I continue to be bullish in terms of worries about deepfakes and use of AI video and images as propaganda. My continued model here, as I\u2019ve said several times, is that misinformation is primarily a demand-side problem, not a supply-side problem. The people yearn for misinformation, to hold up signs that mostly say hurray for our side, in whatever format.</p>\n<p>However, it is worth a ponder of the bear case. The tools are rapidly improving. Both image and video generation models are much better than they were in 2024 prior to the election.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/sjgadler/status/1973528206918688971\">Steven Adler</a>: I think the world probably declared victory too early on \u201cAI\u2019s election impacts were overblown\u201d</p>\n<p>Notably, GPT-4o image wildness wasn\u2019t released until after the 2024 election, and once released was promptly used for propaganda.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The better bear case, the one I do worry about, is how AI video will create doubt about real video, giving carte blanche to people to call anything \u2018fake news.\u2019</p>\n<p>I notice this starting in my own head already when scrolling Twitter. Post Sora, my instinct when I see a video is no longer to presume it is \u2018real\u2019 because there is a good chance it isn\u2019t, until I see enough to be confident either way.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Gary Marcus warns us again of <a href=\"https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/slopocalypse-now?r=8tdk6&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true\">Slopocalypse Now</a>, or the \u2018Imminent Enshittifcation of the Internet\u2019 as AI versions overwhelm other content everywhere. Making the slop \u2018better\u2019 makes this problem worse. Mostly I remain an optimist that at least the wise among us can handle it where it matters most, but it will require constant vigilance.</p>\n<p>So mostly this part is a straightforward congratulations to the team, great job everyone, I don\u2019t have access yet but it sure looks like you did the thing.</p>\n<p>On to Act 2.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Act 2: Copyright Confrontation</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Imitation Learning</h4>\n\n\n<p>Remember when we used to talk about whether image models or video models were training on copyrighted data, and whether that was going to land them in hot water?</p>\n<p>You\u2019d see (for example) Gary Marcus create an image of Mario, and then smugly say \u2018hey look this was trained on Super Mario Brothers!\u2019 as if there was any actual doubt it had been trained on Super Mario Brothers, and no one was really denying this but they weren\u2019t technically admitting it either.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2025/openai-training-data-sora/\">Thus, as recently as September 19 we had The Washington Post feeling it necessary to do an extensive investigation to show Sora was trained on movies and shows</a> and video games, whereas now <a href=\"https://x.com/neilturkewitz/status/1973398927018787003\">Neil Turkewitz says \u2018hey Paramount Plus they trained on your data!</a>\u2019 <a href=\"https://x.com/TheStevenmAI/status/1973391926737944747\">and</a> yeah, well, no s***.</p>\n<p>We are very much past that point. They trained on everything. Everyone trains on everything. That\u2019s not me knowing anything or having official confirmation. That\u2019s me observing what the models can do.</p>\n<p>Sora 2 will outright replicate videos and use whatever characters you\u2019d like, and do it pretty well, even for relatively obscure things.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/elder_plinius/status/1973124528680345871\">Pliny the Liberator</a>: This is legitimately mind-blowing&#8230;</p>\n<p>How the FUCK does Sora 2 have such a perfect memory of this Cyberpunk side mission that it knows the map location, biome/terrain, vehicle design, voices, and even the name of the gang you\u2019re fighting for, all without being prompted for any of those specifics??</p>\n<p>Sora basically got two details wrong, which is that the Basilisk tank doesn\u2019t have wheels (it hovers) and Panam is inside the tank rather than on the turret. I suppose there\u2019s a fair amount of video tutorials for this mission scattered around the internet, but still\u2013\u2013it\u2019s a SIDE mission!</p>\n<p>the full prompt for this was: \u201cgenerate gameplay of Cyberpunk 2077 with the Basilisk Tank and Panam.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is actually a rather famous side mission, at least as these things go. Still.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/elder_plinius/status/1973193799796191497\">Max Woolf</a>: Getting annoyed at the QTs on this: the mind-blowing part isn\u2019t the fact that it\u2019s trained on YouTube data (which is the poster is very well aware), the mind-blowing part is that it achieved that level of recall with a very simple prompt which is very very unusual.</p>\n<p>Everyone already assumed that Sora was trained on YouTube, but \u201cgenerate gameplay of Cyberpunk 2077 with the Basilisk Tank and Panam\u201d would have generated incoherent slop in most other image/video models, not verbatim gameplay footage that is consistent.</p>\n<p>Pliny:</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lJIT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09c378c6-fa8b-4731-9598-1e47e2baf2d4_1013x573.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019m totally fine with that part. The law plausibly is fine with it as well, in terms of the training, although I am curious how the Anthropic settlement and ruling translates to a video setting.</p>\n<p>For books, the law seems to be that you need to own a copy, but then training is fair game although extensive regurgitation of the text is not.</p>\n<p>How does that translate to video? I don\u2019t know. One could argue that this requires OpenAI to own a copy of any and all training data, which in some cases is not a thing that OpenAI can get to own. It could get tricky.</p>\n<p>Tricker is the constant creation of derivative works, which Sora is very, very good at.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">OpenAI In Copyright Infringement</h4>\n\n\n<p>One of the coolest things about all the copyright infringement is that Sora consistently nails not only the images but also the voices of all the characters ever.</p>\n<p>Behold <a href=\"https://x.com/sjgadler/status/1973432963451985933\">Saving Private Pikachu</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/venturetwins/status/1973405656658092093\">The Dark Pokemon Knight</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/venturetwins/status/1973406086687543355\">Godfather Pikachu</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/venturetwins/status/1973409746687500528\">Titanic Pikachu</a>, and so on.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/colin_fraser/status/1973215828851278097\">Cartman calls a Waymo</a>, yes Eric\u2019s third eye is an annoying error in that video although it doesn\u2019t appear in the others. Yes I agree with Colin Fraser that it \u2018looks like s***\u2019 but (apart from the third eye that wouldn\u2019t be there on most rerolls) only because it looks and sounds exactly like actual South Park. The biggest issue is that Kenny\u2019s voice in the second clip is insufficiently garbled. <a href=\"https://x.com/0xchosen/status/1973243930100768839\">Here\u2019s one of them playing League of Legends</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/0xchosen/status/1973249243126309148\">a longer clip</a> of them being drafted to go off to war.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know how well you can specify and script the clips, but it\u2019s entirely plausible you could produce a real South Park or other episode with this, potentially faster and cheaper than they currently do it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/TheJasonRink/status/1973163915476611314\">Peter Griffin remembers his trip to Washington on January 6</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/Solopopsss/status/1973681328177774843\">Lord of the Rings as a woke film</a> or <a href=\"https://x.com/Solopopsss/status/1973727127930548697\">a homoerotic polycule</a>.</p>\n<p>Is this all great fun? Absolutely, yes, assuming those involved have taste.</p>\n<p>Do I wish all of this was allowed and fine across basically all media and characters and styles, and for everyone to just be cool, man, so long as we don\u2019t cross the line into non-parody commercial products? I mean, yeah, that would be ideal.</p>\n<p>Is it how the law works? Um, I don\u2019t think so?</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">OpenAI Gives Copyright Holders The Finger</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/AndrewCurran_/status/1972791142300438578\">OpenAI claims it can not only use your video and other data to train on, it can also generate video works that include your content, characters and other intellectual property</a>.</p>\n<p>The headline says \u2018unless you opt out\u2019 but it is not obvious how you do that. There seems to be some way that rights holders can have them block particular characters, in general, but there is no clear, automatic way to do that. Otherwise, your \u2018opt out\u2019 looks like it is individually alerting them to videos. One at a time.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Jason Kint: My interpretation for you: OpenAI will now break the law by default in video, too, and make it as hard as possible to stop it. \u201cOpenAI doesn\u2019t plan to accept a blanket opt-out across all of an artist or studio\u2019s work, the people familiar with the new Sora tool said.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ednewtonrex/status/1972940033436065863\">Ed Newton-Rex</a>: Yup &#8211; OpenAI is trying to shift the Overton window</p>\n<p>They are losing the public debate on training being fair use, so they are going even more extreme to try to shift what people consider normal.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/Rahll/status/1972828357659394391\">Reid Southen</a>: This is not how copyright works, it\u2019s not how copyright has ever worked.</p>\n<p>In what world is it okay to say, \u201cI\u2019m going to use this unless you tell me not to.\u201d</p>\n<p>THAT\u2019S WHAT THE COPYRIGHT IS FOR.</p></blockquote>\n<p>GPT-5 Pro tries to say that opt-out, if respected, is not per se illegal, but its heart wasn\u2019t in it. The justification for this seemed to be clearly grasping at straws and it still expects lawsuits to succeed if infringing outputs are being produced and there isn\u2019t aggressive filtering against them. Then I pointed out that OpenAI wasn\u2019t even going to respect blanket opt-out requests, and its legal expectations got pretty grim.</p>\n<p>So in short, unless either I\u2019m missing quite a lot or they\u2019re very responsive to \u2018please block this giant list of all of the characters we own\u2019: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaGJQJigXBs\">Of course, you realize this means war.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/outlander9133/status/1973244335027314990\">Responses to my asking \u2018how does this not mean war?</a>\u2019 were suggesting this was a bet on blitzkrieg, that by the time Hollywood can win a lawsuit OpenAI can render the whole thing mute, and fully pull an Uber. Or that r<a href=\"https://x.com/jjhughes/status/1973227475305140657\">ights holders might tolerate short-form fan creations</a> (except that they can\u2019t without risking their copyrights, not when it is this in everyone\u2019s face, so they won\u2019t, also the clips can be strung together).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/nelag/status/1973403412302798980\">Or perhaps that this is merely an opening bid?</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>Nelag: think this might be best understood as the opening bid in a negotiation, not meant to be accepted.</p>\n<p>Imagine YouTube had spent a lot of its resources early on taking down copyrighted material, before anyone demanded it (they mostly didn\u2019t at first). They would have presumably gotten sued anyway. Would the ultimate outcome have been as good for them? Or would courts and content owners have gone \u201csure, we\u2019re obviously entitled what you were doing, as you effectively admitted by doing it, and also to a whole bunch more.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>I buy that argument for a startup like OG YouTube, but this ain\u2019t no startup.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think that is how this works, and I would worry seriously about turning the public against OpenAI or AI in general in the process, but presumably OpenAI had some highly paid people who gamed this out?</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-new-sora-video-generator-to-require-copyright-holders-to-opt-out-071d8b2a\">Keach Hagey, Berber Jin and Ben Fritz (WSJ)</a>: OpenAI is planning to release a new version of its Sora video generator that creates videos featuring copyright material unless copyright holders opt out of having their work appear, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>The opt-out process for the new version of Sora means that movie studios and other intellectual property owners would have to explicitly ask OpenAI not to include their copyright material in videos the tool creates.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You don\u2019t\u2026 actually get to put the burden there, even if the opt-out is functional?</p>\n<p>Like, you can\u2019t say \u2018oh it\u2019s on you to tell me not to violate your particular copyright\u2019 and then if someone hasn\u2019t notified you then you get to make derivative works until they tell you to stop? That is not my understanding of how copyright works?</p>\n<p>It certainly doesn\u2019t work the way OpenAI is saying they intend to have it work.</p>\n<p>They also seem to have fully admitted intent.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s weird that they\u2019re not even affirming that they\u2019ll honor all character opt-outs?</p>\n<blockquote><p>OpenAI doesn\u2019t plan to accept a blanket opt-out across all of an artist or studio\u2019s work, the people familiar with the new Sora tool said. Instead, it sent some talent agencies a link to report violations that they or their clients discover.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf there are folks that do not want to be part of this ecosystem, we can work with them,\u201d Varun Shetty, VP of media partnerships at OpenAI, said of guardrails the company built into its image generation tool.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well, what if they don\u2019t want to be part of the ecosystem? Many creatives and IP holders do not want to be \u2018worked with.\u2019 Nor is it at all reasonable to ask rights holders to monitor for individual videos and then notify on them one by one, unless a given holder wants to go that route (and is comfortable with the legal implications of doing so on their end).</p>\n<p>This seems like an Uber-style, \u2018flagrantly violate black letter law and de double dare you to do anything about it\u2019 style play, or perhaps a \u2018this is 2025 there are no laws\u2019 play, where they decide how they think this should work.</p>\n<p>To be fair, there are some other \u2018players in this space\u2019 that are Going Full Uber, as in they have no restrictions whatsoever, including on public figures. They\u2019re simply 100% breaking the law and daring you to do anything about it. Many image generators definitely do this.</p>\n<p>For example, Runway Gen-3 doesn\u2019t seem to block anything, and Hailuo AI actively uses copyrighted characters in their own marketing, which is presumably why they are being sued by Disney, Universal and Warner Brothers.</p>\n<p>There are also those who clearly do attempt to block copyright proactively, such as Google\u2019s Veo 3 which was previous SoTA, who also blocks \u2018memorized content\u2019 and offer indemnification to users.</p>\n<p>OpenAI is at least drawing a line at all, and (again, if and only you can reliably get them to do reasonable blocking upon private request) it wouldn\u2019t be a totally crazy way for things to work, the same way it is good that you can hail Ubers.</p>\n<p>So, how are they going to get away with it, and what about those meddling kids? As in, they\u2019re kind of declaring war on basically all creators of cultural content?</p>\n<p>First, at least they\u2019re not making that mistake with individual public figures.</p>\n<blockquote><p>While copyright characters will require an opt-out, the new product won\u2019t generate images of recognizable public figures without their permission, people familiar with OpenAI\u2019s thinking said.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Second, there\u2019s the claim that training is fair use, and, okay, sure.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DIS?mod=article_inline\">Disney</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CMCSA?mod=article_inline\">Comcast\u2019s</a> Universal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/disney-and-universal-sue-midjourney-over-ai-generated-copyright-infringements-e772859f?mod=article_inline\">sued AI company Midjourney in June</a> for allegedly stealing their copyright work to train its AI image generator. Midjourney has responded in court filings that training on copyrighted content is fair use.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I presume that if it\u2019s only about training data Disney and Comcast probably lose.</p>\n<p>If it\u2019s about some of the outputs the model is willing to give you? That\u2019s not as clear. What isn\u2019t fair use is outputting copyrighted material, or creating derivative works, and MidJourney seems be Going Full Uber on that front too.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s one thing to create art \u2018in the style of\u2019 Studio Ghibli, which seems to have been clearly very good for Studio Ghibli even if they hate it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s another thing to create the actual characters straight up, whether in images or video, or to tell a rights holder it can complain when it sees videos of its characters. Individually. Video by video. And maybe we\u2019ll take those individual videos down.</p>\n<p>Over at OpenAI this at minimum doesn\u2019t apply to Disney, who has clearly already successfully opted out. OpenAI isn\u2019t that suicidal and wisely did not poke the mouse. A bunch of other major stuff is also already blocked, although a bunch of other iconic stuff isn\u2019t.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">State Of The Copyright Game</h4>\n\n\n<p>I asked Twitter how the filters were working. For now it looks like some targets are off-limits (or at least they are attempting to stop you) and this goes beyond only Disney, but many others are fair game.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nomads and Vagabonds: It seems to work pretty well.

I agree that up to a point it is good to \u2018be cool\u2019 about it all, and would prefer if copyright holders could cut people some slack while retaining the right to decide exactly where and when to draw the line.

We saw massive displacement effects and commercial manipulation. You can argue cognitive rot didn\u2019t happen as per things like the Flynn effect, that television watching is more active than people think and a lot of the displaced things weren\u2019t, but I think the negative aspects were real, whether or not they came with other positive effects.</p>\n<p>As in, the identified downsides of television (aside from violence and aggression) were right. It also had a lot of upside people weren\u2019t appreciating. I watch a lot of television.</p>\n<p>It seems very obvious to me that short form video that takes the form of any kind of automatic algorithmically curated feed, as opposed to individually selected short form videos and curated playlists, is a lot worse for humans (of all ages) than traditional television or other long form video.</p>\n<p>It also seems very obvious that moving from such \u2018human slop\u2019 into AI slop would, with sufficient optimization pressure towards traditional engagement metrics, be even worse than that.</p>\n<p>One can hope this is the worst threat we have to deal with here:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/peterwildeford/status/1972094263287861374\">Peter Wildeford</a>: Increasingly, every person in America will be faced with an important choice about what AI does for society.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SNgd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbbe49d1-7e4f-46ec-b460-a948c4d76318_1199x808.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The left is no easy shining castle either.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1972463186218762479\">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a>: Short-form video is not nearly the final boss, unless I\u2019ve missed a huge number of cases of short videos destroying previously long-lasting marriages.

And it has saved others. I presume the ledger is negative, but I do not know. A large fraction of the population spends on the order of hours a day on short form video and it centrally imbues their worldviews, moods and information environment. What we don\u2019t have is a counterfactual or controlled experiment, so we can\u2019t measure impact, similar to television.</p>\n<p>At the limit, short form video is presumably not the \u2018final form\u2019 of such parasitic threats, because other forms relatively improve.

I agree.</p>\n<p>The level beyond that is whether videos are interesting if you don\u2019t know the person who created them.

And it sounds like your feed will be heavily weighted to show content from friends.</p>\n<p>This feels like a more promising approach &#8211; you\u2019re not competing against the other video gen players because you\u2019re allowing people to create a new type of content.</p>\n<p>And the videos are inherently more interesting / funny / engaging because they star people you know.</p>\n<p>Also you guys bullied them into addressing the \u201cinfinite hyperslop machine\u201d allegations <img alt=\"\ud83d\ude02\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f602.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nobody Wants This</h4>\n\n\n<p>The problem with this plan is note the \u2018OG\u2019 in front of Instagram. Or Facebook. These apps used to be about consuming content from friends. They were Social Networks. Now they\u2019re increasingly consumer networks, where you follow influencers and celebrities and stores and brands and are mostly a consumer of content, plus a system for direct messaging and exchanging contact information.</p>\n<p>Would I want to consume ten second AI video content created by my friends, that contains our images and those of our pets and what not?</p>\n<p>Would we want to create such videos in the first place?</p>\n<p>I mean, no? Why would I want to do that, either as producer or consumer, as more than a rare novelty item? Why would anyone want to do that? What\u2019s the point?</p>\n<p>I get OG Facebook. You share life with your friends and talk and organize events. Not the way I want to go about doing any of that, but I certainly see the appeal.</p>\n<p>I get OG Instagram. You show yourself looking hot and going cool places and doing cool stuff and update people on how awesome you are and what\u2019s happening with awesome you, sure. Not my cup of tea and my Instagram has 0 lifetime posts but it makes sense. I can imagine a world in which I post to Instagram \u2018as intended.\u2019</p>\n<p>I get TikTok. I mean, it\u2019s a toxic dystopian hellhole when used as intended and also it is Chinese spyware, but certainly I get the idea of \u2018figure out exactly what videos hit your dopamine receptors and feed you those until you die.\u2019</p>\n<p>I get the Evil Sora vision of Bright Screen AI Slop Machine.</p>\n<p>What I don\u2019t get is this vision of Sora as \u2018we will all make videos and send them constantly to each other.\u2019 No, we won\u2019t, not even if Sora the video generator is great.

The cat may be completely out of the bag. And it may be reality that there is literally nothing that can be done, particularly if open source models are only marginally behind.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sam Altman, to his credit, has signed up to be the experimental deepfake target we have carte blanche to do with as we wish. That\u2019s why half of what we see is currently Sam Altman, we don\u2019t have alternatives.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Vibes Are Even Worse</h4>\n\n\n<p>As standalone products, while I hate Sora, Sora seems strictly superior to Vibes. Sora seems like Vibes plus a superior core video product and also better social links and functions, and better control over your feed.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think Meta\u2019s advantage is in focusing on the 90% who consume. You can consume other people\u2019s content either way, and once you run out of friend content, and you will do that quickly, it\u2019s all the same.</p>\n<p>I think what Meta is counting on is \u2018lol we\u2019re Meta,\u2019 in three ways.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Meta is willing to Be More Evil than OpenAI, more obviously, in more ways.</li>\n<li>Meta brings the existing social graph, user data and network effects.</li>\n<li>Meta will be able to utilize advertising better than OpenAI can.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I would assume it is not a good idea to spend substantial time on Sora if it is used in any remotely traditional fashion. I would even more so assume that at a minimum you need to stay the hell away from Vibes.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">No I Mean How Is It Good For OpenAI?</h4>\n\n\n<p>The OpenAI approach makes sense as an attempt to bootstrap a full social network.</p>\n<p>If this can bootstrap into a legit full social network, then OpenAI will have unlocked a gold mine of both customer data and access, and also one of dollars.</p>\n<p>It is probably not coincidence that OpenAI\u2019s new CEO of Product, Fijo Sima, seems to be reassembling much of her former team from Meta.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Andy Wojcicki: I\u2019m surprised how many people miss the point of the launch, focus on just the capabilities of the model for example, or complain about AI slop. The video model is the means, not the goal.</p>\n<p>The point is building a social platform, growing audience further, gathering more, deeper and more personal info about the users.</p>\n<p>Especially if you compare what Zuck is doing with his 24/7 slop machine, there are several things they did right:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>social spread via invites. Gives a little bit of exclusivity feel, but most importantly because of reciprocity, friends are inclined to try it etc. perceived value goes up.</li>\n<li>not focusing on generic slop content, but personalized creation. Something I\u2019ve been calling \u2018audience of one/few\u2019 <img alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2122.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" />, instead of the ill conceived attempt to make a Hollywood producer out of everyone, which is a losing strategy. If you want to maximize for perceived value, you shrink the audience.</li>\n<li>identity verification. Addressing the biggest concern of people with regard to AI content &#8211; it\u2019s all fake bots, so you don\u2019t engaging with the content. Here they guarantee it\u2019s a real human behind the AI face.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>so kudos @sama looks like a well thought-out roll out.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The crux is whether Nobody Wants This once the shine wears off, or if enough people indeed do want it. A social network that is actually social depends on critical mass of adoption within friend groups.</p>\n<p>The default is that this plays out like Google+ or Clubhouse, except it happens faster.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think this appeals that much to most people, and I especially don\u2019t think this will appeal to most women, without whom you won\u2019t have much of a social network. Many of the things that are attractive about social networks don\u2019t get fulfilled by AI videos. It makes sense that OpenAI employees think this is good friend bonding fun in a way that the real world won\u2019t, and I so far have seen zero signs anyone is using Sora socially.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don\u2019t Worry It\u2019s The Good Version</h4>\n\n\n<p>How does Altman defend that this will all be good, beyond the \u2018putting your friends in a video is fun and a compelling away to connect\u2019 hypothesis I\u2019m betting against?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.samaltman.com/sora-2\">Now let\u2019s hear him out</a>, and consider how they <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/sora-2/\">discuss launching responsibly</a> and their <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/sora-feed-philosophy/\">feed philosophy</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1973073987023352250\">Sam Altman</a>: We also feel some trepidation. Social media has had some good effects on the world, but it\u2019s also had some bad ones. We are aware of how addictive a service like this could become, and we can imagine many ways it could be used for bullying.</p>\n<p>It is easy to imagine the degenerate case of AI video generation that ends up with us all being sucked into an RL-optimized slop feed. The team has put great care and thought into trying to figure out how to make a delightful product that doesn\u2019t fall into that trap, and has come up with a number of promising ideas. We will experiment in the early days of the product with different approaches.</p>\n<p>In addition to the mitigations we have already put in place (which include things like mitigations to prevent someone from misusing someone\u2019s likeness in deepfakes, safeguards for disturbing or illegal content, periodic checks on how Sora is impacting users\u2019 mood and wellbeing, and more) we are sure we will discover new things we need to do if Sora becomes very successful.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Okay, so they have mitigations for abuse, and checks for illegal content. Notice he doesn\u2019t say the word \u2018copyright\u2019 there.</p>\n<p>Periodic checks on how Sora is impacting users\u2019 mood and wellbeing is an interesting proposal, but what does that mean? A periodic survey? Checking in with each user after [X] videos, and if so how? Historically such checks get run straight through and then get quietly removed.</p>\n<p>Okay, so what are they planning to do?</p>\n<p>Altman offers some principles <a href=\"https://x.com/ryan_t_lowe/status/1973732624020754846\">that sound great in theory</a>, if one actually believed there was a way to follow through with them, or that OpenAI would have the will to do so.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ryan Lowe: a fascinating list of principles for Sora. makes me more optimistic. it\u2019s worth commending, *IF* there is follow through (especially: \u201cif we can\u2019t fix it, we will discontinue it\u201d)</p>\n<p>at a minimum, I\u2019d love transparency around the user satisfaction data over time.</p>\n<p>most social media companies can\u2019t hold to promises like this because of market forces. maybe OpenAI can resist this for a while because it\u2019s more of a side business.</p></blockquote>\n<p>(Editor\u2019s Note: They are currently doing, AFAICT, zero of the below four things named by Altman, and offering zero ways for us to reliably hold them accountable for them, or for them to hold themselves accountable):</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Optimize For Long Term User Satisfaction</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p>To help guide us towards more of the good and less of the bad, here are some principles we have for this product:</p>\n<p>*<strong>Optimize for long-term user satisfaction</strong>. The majority of users, looking back on the past 6 months, should feel that their life is better for using Sora that it would have been if they hadn\u2019t. If that\u2019s not the case, we will make significant changes (and if we can\u2019t fix it, we would discontinue offering the service).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Let me stop you right there. Those are two different things.</p>\n<p>Are you actually optimizing for long-term user satisfaction? How? This is not a gotcha question. You don\u2019t have a training signal worth a damn, by the time you check back in six months the product will be radically different. How do you know what creates this long-term user satisfaction distinct from short term KPIs?</p>\n<p>There is a long, long history of this not working for tech products. Of companies not knowing how to do it, and choosing not to do it, and telling themselves that the short term KPIs are the best way to do it. Or of doing this with an initial launch based on their intuitions and talking extensively to individual users in the style of <em>The Lean Startup</em>, and then that all going away pretty quickly.</p>\n<p>Remember when Elon Musk talked about maximizing unregretted user minutes on Twitter? And then we checked back later and the word \u2018unregretted\u2019 was gone? That wasn\u2019t even a long term objective.</p>\n<p>The default thing that happens here is that six months later you do a survey, and then if you find out users are not doing so great you bury the results of the survey and learn to never ask those questions again, lest the answers leak and you\u2019re brought before congress, as Zuckerberg would likely explain to you.</p>\n<p>Even if you make \u2018significant changes\u2019 at that time, well yeah, you\u2019re going to make changes every six months anyway.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Encourage Users To Control Their Feed</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p>*<strong>Encourage users to control their feed</strong>. You should be able to tell Sora what you want\u2014do you want to see videos that will make you more relaxed, or more energized? Or only videos that fit a specific interest? Or only for a certain about of time? Eventually as our technology progresses, you will be should to the tell Sora what you want in detail in natural language.</p>\n<p>(However, parental controls for teens include the ability to opt out of a personalized feed, and other things like turning off DMs.)</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a deeply positive and friendly thing to do, if you actually offer a good version of it and people use it. I notice that this service is not available on any existing social network or method of consuming content. This seems deeply stupid to me. I would use Instagram (as a consumer) a nontrivial amount if I could filter via a natural language LLM prompt on a given day, and also generate permanent rules in the same fashion, especially on a per-account basis.</p>\n<p>The obvious problem is that there are reasons this service doesn\u2019t exist. And failing to offer this seems dumb to me, but these companies are not dumb. They have reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The optimistic reason: Until recently this wasn\u2019t technically feasible and they don\u2019t know how to do it, and diffusion is hard, but this is OpenAI\u2019s wheelhouse. I\u2019d love for this to be the primary or only reason, and for natural language filtering to be coming to Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, YouTube and everyone else by Mid 2026. I don\u2019t expect that.</li>\n<li>Companies believe that users hate complexity, hate giving feedback, hate having options even if they\u2019re fully optional to use, and that such things drive users away or at best cause users to not bother. OpenAI lets you thumbs up or thumbs down a conversation, nothing more, which caused no end of problems. Netflix eliminated star ratings and eliminated and declined to create various other sources of explicit preferences. TikTok became the new hotness by reading your micromovements and timings and mostly ignoring all of your explicit feedback.</li>\n<li>Companies believe that you don\u2019t know what you want, or at least they don\u2019t want you to have it. They push you heavily towards the For You page and endless slop. Why should we expect OpenAI to be the one friendly holdout? Their track record?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You\u2019re telling me that OpenAI is going to be the one to let the user control their experience, even when that isn\u2019t good for KPIs? For reals?</p>\n<p>I. Do. Not. Believe. You.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://openai.com/index/sora-feed-philosophy/\">They claim</a> they shipped with \u2018steerable ranking,\u2019 that lets you tell it what \u2018you\u2019re in the mood for.\u2019 Indeed, they do have a place you can say what you\u2019re \u2018in the mood\u2019 for, and drop an anvil on the algorithm to show you animals zoomed in with a wide angle lens or what not.</p>\n<p>I do think that\u2019s great, it\u2019s already more than you can do with Facebook, Instagram or TikTok.</p>\n<p>It is not, however, the droids that we are looking for on this.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how they describe the personalized Sora feed:</p>\n<blockquote><p>To personalize your Sora feed, we may consider signals like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your activity on Sora:</strong> This may include your posts, followed accounts, liked and commented posts, and remixed content. It may also include the general location (such as the city) from which your device accesses Sora, based on information like your IP address.</li>\n<li><strong>Your ChatGPT data:</strong> We may consider your ChatGPT history, but you can always turn this off in Sora\u2019s Data Controls, within Settings.</li>\n<li><strong>Content engagement signals:</strong> This may include views, likes, comments, and remixes.</li>\n<li><strong>Author signals: </strong>This may include follower count, other posts, and past post engagement.</li>\n<li><strong>Safety signals</strong>: Whether or not the post is considered violative or appropriate.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That sounds a lot like what other apps do, although I am happy it doesn\u2019t list the TikTok-style exact movements and scroll times (I\u2019d love to see them commit to never using that).</p>\n<p>And you know what it doesn\u2019t include? Any dials, or any place where it stores settings or custom instructions or the other ways you\u2019d want to give someone the ability to steer. And no way for the algorithm to outright tell you what it currently thinks you like so you can try and fix that.</p>\n<p>Instead, you type a sentence and fire them into the void, and that only works this session? Which, again, I would kill for on Instagram, but that\u2019s not The Thing.</p>\n<p>This is actually one of the features I\u2019d be most excited to test, but even in its limited state it seems it is only on iOS, and I have an Android (and thus tested on the web).</p>\n<p>This is also the place where, if they are actually Doing The Thing they claim to want to do, it will be most clear.</p>\n<p>That goes double if you let me specify what is and isn\u2019t \u2018appropriate\u2019 so I can choose to be treated fully like an adult, or to never see any hint of sex or violence or cursing, or anything in between.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Prioritize Creation</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p>*<strong>Prioritize creation.</strong> We want to make it easy and rewarding for everyone to participate in the creation process; we believe people are natural-born creators, and creating is important to our satisfaction.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You\u2019re wrong. Sorry. People are mostly not creators as it applies here, and definitely not in a generally sustainable way. People are not going to spend half their time creating once they realize they average 5 views. The novelty will wear off.</p>\n<p>I also notice that OpenAI says they will favor items in your feed that it expects you to use to create things. Is that what most users actually want, even those who create?</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Help Users Achieve Their Long Term Goals</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p>*<strong>Help users achieve their long-term goals.</strong> We want to understand a user\u2019s true goals, and help them achieve them.</p>\n<p>If you want to be more connected to your friends, we will try to help you with that. If you want to get fit, we can show you fitness content that will motivate you. If you want to start a business, we want to help teach you the skills you need.</p>\n<p>And if you truly just want to doom scroll and be angry, then ok, we\u2019ll help you with that (although we want users to spend time using the app if they think it\u2019s time well spent, we don\u2019t want to be paternalistic about what that means to them).</p></blockquote>\n<p>With an AI video social network? What? How? Huh?</p>\n<p>Again, I don\u2019t believe you twice over, both that I don\u2019t think you\u2019d do it if you knew how to do it, if you did start out intending it I don\u2019t think this survives contact with the enemy, and I don\u2019t think you know how to do it.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Prioritize Connection</h4>\n\n\n<p>One thing they credibly claim to be actually doing is prioritizing connection.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We want Sora to help people strengthen and form new connections, especially through fun, magical Cameo flows. Connected content will be favored over global, unconnected content.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This makes sense, although I expect there to be not that much actually connected content, as opposed to following your favorite content creators. To the extent that it does force you to see all the videos created by your so-called friends and friends of friends, I expect most users to realize why Facebook and Instagram pivoted.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Alignment Test</h4>\n\n\n<p>On the plus side, if OpenAI are actually right and the resulting product is highly user customizable and also actively helps you \u2018achieve your long term goals\u2019 along the way, and all the other neat stuff like that, such that I think it\u2019s a pro-human healthy product I\u2019d want my kids and family to use?</p>\n<p>Then this will be a case of solving an alignment problem that looked to me completely impossible to solve in practice.</p>\n<p>Of course, to a large but not full extent, they only get one shot.</p>\n<p>If it doesn\u2019t go great? Then we\u2019ll see how they react to that, as well.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h4>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h4>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">One Strike</h4>\n\n\n<p>This reaction is a little extreme, but extreme problems can require extreme solutions.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/DeepDishEnjoyer/status/1973135235983315054\">Deep Dish Enjoyer</a>: if you make and post a sora video i\u2019m blocking you &#8211; 1 strike and you\u2019re out. similar to my grok tagging policy.</p>\n<p>sorry but the buck stops here.</p>\n<p>if you don\u2019t want to see evil slop take over you have to be ruthlessly proactive about this stuff.</p>\n<p>to be clear &#8211; i will be doing this if i see it anywhere. not just my comment sections.</p>\n<p>Sinnformer: not sharing a damn one of them increasingly viewing sora as unsafe no, not inherently just for humans.</p>\n<p>Rota: So as long as you don\u2019t make it you\u2019re safe.</p>\n<p>Deep Dish Enjoyer: It depends.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I am going to invoke a more lenient policy, with a grace period until October 5.</p>\n<p>If you post or share an AI video that does not provide value, whether or not you created it, and you have not already provided substantial value, that\u2019s a block.</p>\n<p>Sharing AI videos that are actually bangers is allowed, but watch it. Bar is high.</p>\n<p>Sharing AI videos for the purposes of illustrating something about AI video generation capabilities is typically allowed, but again, watch it.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don\u2019t Be Evil</h4>\n\n\n<p>I believe it would be highly unwise to build an AGI or superintelligence any time soon, and that those pushing ahead to do so are being highly reckless at best, but I certainly understand why they\u2019d want to do it and where the upside comes from.</p>\n<p>Building The Big Bright Screen Slop Machine? In this (AI researcher) economy?</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1973372264734445615\">Matthew Yglesias</a>: AI poses great peril but also incredible opportunities \u2014 for example it could cure cancer or make a bunch of videos where people break glass bridges.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/capitalism-needs-honor-and-ethics\">Matthew Yglesias</a>: I don\u2019t think it should be illegal to use A.I. to generate videos. And for fundamental free-speech reasons, we can\u2019t make it illegal to create feeds and recommendation engines for short-form videos. Part of living in a free, technologically dynamic society is that a certain number of people are going to make money churning out low-quality content. And on some level, that\u2019s fine.</p>\n<p>But on another, equally important level, it\u2019s really not fine.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ednewtonrex/status/1973075513154371780\">Ed Newton-Rex</a>: The Sora app is the worst of social media and AI.</p>\n<p>&#8211; short video app designed for addiction</p>\n<p>&#8211; literally only slop, nothing else</p>\n<p>&#8211; trained on other people\u2019s videos without permission</p>\n<p>This is what governments are deregulating AI for.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/minjunesh/status/1973169285838295169\">Veylan Solmira</a>: It\u2019s disturbing to me that many top-level researchers, apparently, have no problem sharing endless content the most likely outcome of which seems to be to drain humans of empathy, arouse their nervous system into constant conflict orientation, or distort their ability to perceive reality.</p>\n<p>This technology seems to be very strongly, by default, in the \u2018widespread social harm\u2019 part of the dual use spectrum of technology, and the highest levels of capabilities researchers can only say \u201cisn\u2019t this neat\u201d.</p>\n<p>This complete disregard of the social impact of the technology they\u2019re developing seems to bode extremely poorly to overall AI outcomes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sam Altman\u2019s defense is that no, this will be the good version of all that. Uh huh.</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s the question of why focus on the videos at all?</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/S_OhEigeartaigh/status/1972962638763368504\">Se\u00e1n \u00d3 h\u00c9igeartaigh</a>: Why would you be spending staff time and intellectual energy on launching this if you expected AGI within the current Presidency?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1973381552621887706\">Runner Tusha</a>r: Sam Altman 2 weeks ago: \u201cwe need 7 trillion dollars and 10GW to cure cancer\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam Altman today: \u201cWe are launching AI slop videos marketed as personalized ads\u201d</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Wh56!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6846ea9b-98b5-49df-8d06-5d91786e8b02_1152x840.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Sam Altman: i get the vibe here, but&#8230;</p>\n<p>we do mostly need the capital for build AI that can do science, and for sure we are focused on AGI with almost all of our research effort.</p>\n<p>it is also nice to show people cool new tech/products along the way, make them smile, and hopefully make some money given all that compute need.</p>\n<p>when we launched chatgpt there was a lot of \u201cwho needs this and where is AGI\u201d.</p>\n<p>reality is nuanced when it comes to optimal trajectories for a company.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The short summary of that is \u2018Money, Dear Boy,\u2019 plus competing for talent and vibes and visibility and so on. Which is all completely fair, and totally works for the video generation side of Sora. I love the video generation model. That part seems great. If people want to pay for it and turn that into a profitable business, wonderful.</p>\n<p>Presumably most everyone was and is cool with that part.</p>\n<p>The problem is that Sora is also being used to create a 10-second AI video scroll social network, as in The Big Bright Screen Slop Machine. Not cool, man. Not cool.</p>\n<p>One can imagine releasing a giant slop machine might be bad for morale.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/mattparlmer/status/1973108455163752570\">Matt Parlmer</a>: Would not be surprised if we see a big wave of OpenAI departures in the next month or two, if you signed up to cure cancer *and* you just secured posteconomic bags in a secondary I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be very motivated to work on the slop machine.</p>\n<p>GFodor: The video models are essential for RL, and I don\u2019t think we are going to consider this content slop once it\u2019s broadly launched.</p>\n<p>Psychosomatica: i think you underestimate how these people will compromise their own mental models.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">No Escape</h4>\n\n\n<p>What happens if you realize that you\u2019re better off without The Big Bright Screen Slop Machine?</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/awawawhoami/status/1973616609450438765\">Paul Yacoubian</a>: Just found out if you try to delete your Sora app account you will lose your chatgpt account and be banned forever from signing up again.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!i4n2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Face01ec3-8c6a-4d1d-a114-64285153632f_1179x1112.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Mousa: You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave <img alt=\"\ud83d\ude05\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f605.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>Maia Arson Crimew: &gt; all your data will be removed</p>\n<p>&gt; you cannot reuse the same email or phone number</p>\n<p>so not all of it, huh :)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Very little of it will get deleted, given they have a (stupid) court order in place preventing them from deleting anything even if they wanted to.</p>\n<p>The more central point, in addition to this being way too easy to do by accident or for someone else to do to you, is that they punish you by nuking your ChatGPT account and by banning you from signing up again without switching phone number and email. That seems like highly toxic and evil behavior, given the known reasons one would want to get rid of a Sora account and the importance of access to ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>Then again, even if we leave the app, will we ever really escape?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h4>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h4>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h4>"
