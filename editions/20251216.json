And when you understand that number, you will understand the rage of Americans who have been told that their lives have been getting better when they are barely able to stay afloat.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The official poverty line of $32,000 for a family of four seems both totally arbitrary and obviously too low if you look at taxes and transfers, in the same way that the median income of $140,000, where Green wants to set that poverty line, is absurdly high.</p>\n<p>Neither number is saying a useful thing about whether people are barely able to stay afloat, or whether lives are getting better. My guess is the right number is ~$50,000.</p>\n<p>The point of a poverty line is not \u2018what does it take to live as materially well as the median American.\u2019</p>\n<p>Green literally equates the poverty line with median income, in two distinct ways. No, really. He equates this with \u2018basic participation.\u2019 That\u2019s not how any of that works.</p>\n<p>Poverty actually means (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty\">from Wikipedia</a>) \u201ca state or condition in which an individual lacks the financial resources and essentials for a basic<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living\"> standard of living</a>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Neither of those things is well predicted by the same number of constant dollars over time. The first is especially not well predicted, and the second mostly is not either. The minimum basket of goods does not track inflation.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Let\u2019s Debunk The Whole Calculation Up Front</h4>\n\n\n<p>Before I get to the chorus of debunkers, I\u2019ll briefly join that chorus for those who came in late and point out that the underlying math that Michael Green does is deeply, deeply stupid, it makes even less sense than you think, as in it is actually tautological equating of median income with poverty except with calculation errors.</p>\n<p>I mostly wrote my debunk before reading the others, but we found the same things, so if you\u2019ve read the others you can skip this section and the next one.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Michael Green: In 2024, food-at-home is no longer 33 percent of household spending. For most families, it\u2019s 5 to 7 percent. Housing now consumes 35 to 45 percent. Healthcare takes 15 to 25 percent. Childcare, for families with young children, can eat 20 to 40 percent.</p>\n<p>If you keep [the original] logic [of the poverty threshold]\u2014if you maintain [the] principle that poverty could be defined by the inverse of food\u2019s budget share\u2014but update the food share to reflect today\u2019s reality, the multiplier is no longer three.</p>\n<p>It becomes <em>16</em>. Which means\u2026the threshold for a family of four\u2014the official poverty line in 2024\u2014wouldn\u2019t be $31,200. If the crisis threshold\u2014the floor below which families cannot function\u2014is honestly updated to current spending patterns, it lands at close to $140,000.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As in, he\u2019s taking a food, multiplying by (14 or 16), and calling that the poverty line, because food-at-home is (1/14th or 1/16th) of typical household spending. Even if his calculations were correct: Seriously, what? You presumably see (some of the) problems?</p>\n<p>(The calculations also aren\u2019t correct in other ways, at minimum he should be using total food share which only leads to a 7.8 multiplier, and the way he\u2019s backing out minimum food costs is assuming costs rose exactly with CPI,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOmD-xqK2Es\"> but that\u2019s not important right now</a>.)</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the same as saying \u2018the poverty line is equal to typical household spending.\u2019</p>\n<p>Well, it\u2019s that plus the error from the conflation of food with food-at-home, the \u2018what do people actually spend\u2019 calculation should end up in more like $80k, almost exactly American median income Mike claims American households make (he\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s actually $125k for families of four, whoops).</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not a coincidence. This methodology would say that half the people will always be under the poverty line, no matter how rich or poor those people were.</p>\n<p>Poverty here is being defined as \u2018below the median.\u2019 Except with a bug in the math.</p>\n<p>Thus, contra Green, there\u2019s no typical expense that this \u2018doesn\u2019t include.\u2019</p>\n<p>If your response is \u2018parts of this are what the original calculation did, kind of\u2019 my answer is: I do not care, not even a little, that a different calculation was also ad-hoc nonsense followed by CPI adjustments. We agree that the $32k number also isn\u2019t right.</p>\n<p>He then uses the \u2018living wage calculator\u2019 to assemble a typical household budget in Essex County, New Jersey, a relatively expensive metro area. His source says \u2018typical expenses\u2019 there require $96k in income if one parent is working, $136k if two parents are working, mostly due to a $32k child care gap which is nonsensical if the children are in school.<a href=\"https://scottwinship.substack.com/p/apocalypse-not\"> All of which Scott Winship analyzes and finds patently absurd on multiple levels.</a></p>\n<p>But once again ignore all those numbers because he\u2019s literally using the \u2018typical expenses\u2019 calculation, which has basically nothing to do with the minimum spend or any reasonable definition of a poverty rate, hence the $32k in child care, the paying full healthcare premiums and so on. Once again this calculation makes no sense.</p>\n<p>(Oh, and fun note via Noah Smith,<a href=\"https://www.noahpinion.blog/i/180210438/this-is-not-how-to-think-about-poverty\"> poor people in America still spend about a third of their money on food</a>.)</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Debunking Chorus</h4>\n\n\n<p>A chorus rose up to explain this person being Wrong On The Internet. Here\u2019s some pull quotes and overviews. Several of these links go into great detail, some would say unnecessary detail but those some would be wrong, we thank all of you for your service.</p>\n<p>Scott Lincicome<a href=\"https://www.cato.org/commentary/140000-poverty-line-laughably-wrong-so-why-does-it-feel-right\"> called this a \u2018nerd fight\u2019</a> but I mean stop, stop, he\u2019s already dead.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-140000-poverty-line-is-very-silly\">Noah Smith has some excellent common sense graphs</a> for sanity checks showing Americans mostly do have adequate health care, food, transportation and space.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://scottwinship.substack.com/p/how-not-to-redefine-poverty\">Scott Winship has</a><a href=\"https://scottwinship.substack.com/p/the-real-math-of-survival\"> the most detailed</a><a href=\"https://scottwinship.substack.com/p/apocalypse-not\"> debunking methodology</a>, if you want that. This includes noticing that in many calculations Winship goes beyond relying on medians. He instead moves to average (mean) spending in various categories, which is even more absurd a comparison point, and when he breaks down the \u2018typical budget\u2019 based on Essex County we see absurdity after absurdity.</p>\n<p>His analysis also contains the central conflation I\u2019ll be largely focusing on next time, which is that yes Americans now have higher real incomes and buy vastly more and better stuff, but that this does not automatically mean survival is easier because Americans now are required to buy and expect to get vastly more and better stuff.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/ATabarrok/status/1993805826457538812\">Alex Tabarrok</a>: Of course<a href=\"https://x.com/jmhorp\"> \u2066Jeremy Horpedahl</a>\u2069<a href=\"https://economistwritingeveryday.com/2025/11/26/the-poverty-line-is-not-140000/\"> is correct</a>. I would just add that this is another example of grievance culture. Right or left almost everyone wants to blame someone else\u2014billionaires, minorities, immigrants, foreigners, white people, systematic racism etc.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ptuomov/status/1994069190974624151\">Ptuomov</a>: There are two issues here.</p>\n<p>The first is that Mike\u2019s numbers are off, as explained in the link below. This is a minor issue.</p>\n<p>The second and more serious issue is that I think he is confusing two very different questions:</p>\n<p>1. What does it take to not be so poor in the US that poverty itself closes doors for you and your children?</p>\n<p>2. What does it take for a family man to feel like a success in the US?</p>\n<p>In my opinion, Mike uses the word \u201cpoverty\u201d but is actually writing about the second question.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m no bleeding heart-liberal by any means, but I think there is legitimate reason to reduce the type of true poverty that causes a newborn child to be excluded from self-improvement opportunities of which he could realistically take advantage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/capitolism/poverty-level-middle-class-expectations/\">Scott Lincicome:</a> Fortunately for us, subsequent scrutiny\u2014including from some of <strong>Capitolism</strong>\u2019s favorite scholars\u2014revealed Green to have been spectacularly, demonstrably wrong in all sorts of obvious and less obvious ways. Most American families, it turns out, aren\u2019t living hand-to-mouth, and, while real affordability challenges exist, the general long-term trend for both middle-class living and real poverty has been positive.</p>\n<p>The Numbers\u2014and Entire Premise\u2014Were Nonsense.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thefp.com/p/the-myth-of-the-140000-poverty-line?taid=692ccdbdc7c4790001ec0e10&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter\">Tyler Cowen</a>: Fortunately for us, this [poverty line of $140k] is all wrong. The underlying concepts are wrong, and the user of evidence is misguided. There are genuine concerns about affordability in the United States, but the analysi in this article is not a good way to understand them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-140000-poverty-line-is-very-silly\">Noah Smith</a>: But despite its popularity, Green\u2019s claim is <em>wrong</em>. Not just slightly wrong or technically wrong, but just totally off-base and out of touch with reality. In fact, it\u2019s so wrong that I\u2019m willing to call it \u201cvery silly\u201d. I know Mike Green, and I count him as a friend, but we all write silly things once in a while,<a href=\"https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-140000-poverty-line-is-very-silly#footnote-1-180210438\"><sup>1</sup></a> and when we do, we deserve to be called out on it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://economistwritingeveryday.com/2025/11/26/the-poverty-line-is-not-140000/\">Jeremy Horpedahl</a>: I think there are at least three major errors Mr. Green makes in the essay:</p></blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>He drastically underestimates how much income American families have.</li>\n<li>He drastically overstates how much spending is necessary to support a family, because he uses <em>average</em> spending figures and treats them as <em>minimum </em>amounts.</li>\n<li>He obsesses over the Official Poverty Measure, since it was originally based on the cost of food in the 1960s, and ignores that Census already has a new poverty measure which takes into account food, shelter, clothing, and utility costs: the Supplement Poverty Measure.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/02/the-poverty-line-isnt-a-vibe/\">We also have Eric Boehm in Reason</a>, and no doubt many more.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Okay It\u2019s Not $140k But The Vibes Mean Something</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/CliffordAsness/status/1995449309555216385\">Clifford Asness</a>: The populist fabulists will only move the goal posts again.</p>\n<p>It started as 140k was \u201cpoverty\u201d moved on to something softer about \u201cparticipation\u201d (not that this isn\u2019t a real concept it\u2019s just not poverty) and now is down to \u201cyou can\u2019t deny the ennui\u201d and \u201call we meant was government programs are poorly designed to punish those seeking to leave poverty\u201d something poverty scholars have only yelled about 1mm times.</p>\n<p>Data + analysis &gt;&gt; vibes which sadly doesn\u2019t mean they win in the court of public opinion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ModeledBehavior/status/1995148248932393302\">Adam Ozimek</a>: The defense of the $140k poverty line post have retreated to yes the data is wrong, yes the core claim is wrong, but it is a complaint about standard of living improvement in the US so I must nevertheless say it\u2019s good.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Guess who led this chorus?<a href=\"https://www.yesigiveafig.com/p/part-2-the-door-has-opened\"> Michael Green</a>, saying that \u2018accuracy\u2019 was not the point.</p>\n<p>If people keep insisting life sucks and the vibes are bad then you should believe them that there is a problem, that in some important way their life sucks and the vibes are bad. That doesn\u2019t mean you need to respect the actual claims if they are false, but if you are trying to figure out what is true the defense of those claims is important evidence. Listen.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Needing Two Incomes Has A High Cost</h4>\n\n\n<p>This also leads into themes I mostly am saving for next time, but needs to be mentioned here: A family with one typical income will increasingly fall behind.</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make the numbers work that way. You can. Falling behind doesn\u2019t mean starving. Falling behind still sucks. A lot.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/MattBruenig/status/1996929090079936748\">Matt Bruenig</a>: New piece at @PplPolicyProj. It\u2019s my entry into the \u201c$140k is poverty\u201d discourse and the \u201cyou used to be able to live comfortably on a single income\u201d discourse more generally. I think I know how to make sense of it that does not require nonsense claims.</p>\n<p>One way to put it that I ultimately cut out of the piece is imagine your society went from a 20-hour workweek to a 40-hour workweek but not everyone went along with the change. You could accurately say that you used to be able to afford a normal life on 20 hours but now you cant.</p>\n<p>But rather than seeing that clearly for what it is &#8212; the standard for a normal life has ratcheted upward with more income/output &#8212; there is a temptation to say that there is hidden costs or inflation or whatever that have fully swallowed increased income etc.</p>\n<p>\u2026 If everyone around me started working 20 hours of overtime each week and I didn\u2019t, then that would suck.

And no, this wasn\u2019t one isolated error, it was part of a string of errors mostly in the same direction, that people are very carefully and politely pointing out. All the careful pushback warmed my heart to see it. Have you tried making true claims instead?</p>\n<p>The post went viral because of the false claims, and that was the message most people got.

If marginal tax rates are very high, there\u2019s no push to earn more money, so you don\u2019t advance your career and you never earn enough to escape poverty.

Oh yes, absolutely, it\u2019s all quite terrible, and we should work on solutions to make this whole thing sane.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Poverty Trap Versus Poverty Line</h4>\n\n\n<p>However, note that the basic problem will remain, which is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To live reasonably, people implicitly need ~$50k in total pay and benefits, given the Revolution of Rising Requirements and what you by law have to purchase.</li>\n<li>Thus, if you make less, we give you the difference, or your family starves.</li>\n<li>If you make more, we are going to tax you to pay for all of that.</li>\n<li>If you make the climb in effective pay steeper you make it suck that much more to make less money. You have to pick, how progressive will you make your taxation?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As an intuition pump to how tricky this is, redone from scratch for 2025, for families of exactly 4 only for now: We could change to instead provide a universal basic income (you can also call it a negative income tax) of $40k per family, plus a flat tax of about 25%-35% (depending on implementation details elsewhere) to $250k, then resume the current tax rates (so we don\u2019t change how much we raise from the top of the distribution). No other default benefits, including Medicare and Medicaid, and no other federal taxes (no payroll, no Medicare tax and so on). My quick calculation says that\u2019s roughly revenue neutral. Is that style of approach better? Maybe, but there\u2019s at least one huge obvious problem, which is that this creates unsubsidized health insurance markets with no fallback, and so many others we\u2019re not noticing. Of course, there\u2019s huge upsides, especially if you fix the worst of the secondary effects.</p>\n<p>Either way, good luck passing anything like this. The numbers are brutal if you\u2019re not willing to blow up a bunch of sacred values somewhere.</p>\n<p>The details Green discusses here are wrong again, including the fragility issue, but he\u2019d be the first one to tell you the details and exact numbers don\u2019t matter. His claim about a \u2018different nature of the struggle\u2019 doesn\u2019t make sense.</p>\n<p>But here, yes, this part\u2019s very true and important, nail meet head:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The question we are increasingly asking is, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we having more families and procreating?\u201d The answer, largely, is that we are asking families to make an investment in children that becomes a future common good and penalizing them for doing so.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yes. Many people are saying. Children are an expensive public good. They are getting relatively expensive compared to other goods thanks to the Revolution of Rising Requirements. We are expecting parents to foot a huge portion of the bill, and that is the big problem.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not a new big problem. The story of the world outside of farms has been, roughly, \u2018spend your life trying to earn enough money to support as big a family as you can.\u2019</p>\n<p>He closes by making a bunch of other vibe-level and directionally correct but importantly false statements about the nature of wealth and transfers and the signaling theory of education, written to give a false impression, to equate the directional vibes with reality.</p>\n<p>That works on a certain type of reader. To me and hopefully my readers, it\u2019s toxic.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Double or Nothing</h4>\n\n\n<p>As a closing fun note, it can always be worse.</p>\n<p>As in:<a href=\"https://x.com/Budgetdog_/status/1996251426268344678\"> You have to love the community note on this</a> graph.</p>\n<p>No, seriously, he took the MIT Living Wage Calculator and doubled it, and considers \u2018comfortable\u2019 to include 20% savings while meeting all \u2018wants and needs.\u2019 Must be nice.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e9V2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F072483df-0116-4774-a42e-6d2dd195b2fd_858x1160.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<blockquote><p>Brennan Schlagbaum: For context&#8230;</p>\n<p>SmartAsset studied how much families need to live a \u201cnormal\u201d life in every US state.
