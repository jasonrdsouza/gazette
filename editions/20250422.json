He was trying to see whether microwaves could affect it. He would spin the wheel, mark down the result, then spin it and put it in a microwave oven and record the result. &#8220;It was nuts&#8221;, Peter says. Errol had become convinced that he could find a system for beating the game. He dragged Elon to the Pretoria casino many times, dressing him up so that he looked older than sixteen, and had him write down the numbers while Errol used a calculator hidden under a betting card.</p><p>Elon went to the library and read a few books on roulette and even wrote a roulette simulation program on his computer. He then tried to convince his father that none of his schemes would work. But Errol believed that he had found a deeper truth about probability and, as he later described it to me, an &#8220;almost total solution to what is called randomness.&#8221; When I asked him to explain it, he said, &#8220;There are no &#8216;random events&#8217; or &#8216;chance.&#8217; All events follow the Fibonacci Sequence, like the Mandelbrot Set. I went on to discover the relationship between &#8216;chance&#8217; and the Fibonacci Sequence. This is the subject for a scientific paper. If I share it, all activities relying on &#8216;chance&#8217; will be ruined, so I am in doubt as to doing that.&#8221;</p><p>I&#8217;m not quite sure what all that means. Neither is Elon: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how he went from being great at engineering to believing in witchcraft. But he somehow made that evolution.&#8221; Errol can be very forceful and occasionally convincing. &#8220;He changes reality around him&#8221;, Kimbal says. &#8220;He will literally make up things, but he actually believes his own false reality.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This is the main data point that keeps me from 100% believing the &#8220;it&#8217;s all ketamine&#8221; theory.

Does the average person really eat chicken 9x a week?</p><p><strong>33: </strong>Not going to waste your time listing every bad thing Trump has done this month, but among the worst is sending innocent people to horrible Salvadorean prisons (<a href=\"https://x.com/zackbeauchamp/status/1905008507444666792\">including</a> one person picked up because he had an autism awareness tattoo in honor of his brother, which they mistook for a gang tattoo), then refusing to bring them back. I have seen a couple of people defend denying immigrants due process; I assume they will not be moved by humanitarian arguments, but I think there are some more practical considerations:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://x.com/ZaidJilani/status/1906905057313886418\">Zaid Jilani</a> points out that if immigrants don&#8217;t get a right to due process, citizens also don&#8217;t get a right to due process, because the government can kidnap citizens, claim they&#8217;re immigrants, and the citizens can&#8217;t prove otherwise since they don&#8217;t get due process.</p></li><li><p>The Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-constitutional-rights-do-undocumented-immigrants-have\">has long maintained</a> that immigrants have a right due process, including such bleeding-heart liberals as Antonin Scalia.</p></li><li><p>If you want to maintain a taboo, it often helps to keep things that look identical to it taboo. For example, to maintain the taboo against child porn, you might also want to ban AI-generated child porn where no actual children are harmed, because if you allow this, then the difference between a taboo act (watching real child porn) and an allowed act (watching AI-generated child porn) is just checking the label to see how a porn video was made, and it&#8217;s hard to maintain social outrage against people who are doing the same thing as lots of other people but except for checking labels. In the same way, colleges and other communities mix citizens and immigrants together so closely that it&#8217;s hard to tell who is who without asking. If the government can punish immigrants for speaking freely, then it&#8217;s hard to maintain bright-line outrage against it punishing citizens for speaking freely when the only difference is who has a green card vs. a passport, something that the person&#8217;s community might not even know.</p></li></ul><p><strong>34: </strong>Related: the Trump administration seems to be <a href=\"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/what-is-john-roberts-thinking\">refusing to comply with a 9-0 Supreme Court order</a> to bring back a specific deported immigrant. This is obviously terrifying, but superforecaster Peter Wildeford says <a href=\"https://x.com/peterwildeford/status/1912492747103121420\">it is not technically a constitutional crisis yet</a> (X) because there are still some formalities the courts need to go to before they have officially &#8220;ordered&#8221; Trump to bring back the immigrant, and he won&#8217;t have officially &#8220;defied&#8221; the order until the formalities are complete. This doesn&#8217;t make me too much calmer but I guess is good to keep in mind.

My proposed solution (drawing, of course, on medieval Iceland) is that the Supreme Court should be able to directly enforce its decisions by declaring violators to be &#8220;outlaws&#8221;; not only do outlaws lose the protection of the law, but anyone who uses force to defend of an outlaw becomes an outlaw themselves.

After the war, the Australians tried to use him as a spokesperson to introduce New Guinea tribesmen to the civilized world. But Yali was both power-hungry and didn&#8217;t really understand civilization, so he ended up as the prophet of a new cargo cult instead. &#8220;People continued to give him gifts, and he collected a fee for baptising Christians who wanted to wash away the sins of Christianity and return to paganism.&#8221;</p><p><strong>38: </strong><a href=\"https://www.ncronline.org/opinion/guest-voices/will-musk-and-trump-go-hell-defunding-corporal-works-mercy\">National Catholic Reporter</a> comes on strong: &#8220;If you believe the Scripture is the Word of God, the message is clear: Musk and Trump will go to hell for defunding the corporal works of mercy.&#8221;</p><p><strong>39: </strong><a href=\"https://www.conspicuouscognition.com/p/misinformation-isnt-a-contagious\">Misinformation Is Not A Contagious Virus You Can Be Inoculated Against</a>.
