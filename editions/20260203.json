                "<div class=\"trix-content\">\n  <div>I fully understand the nostalgia for real ownership of physical-media games. I grew up on cassette tapes (C64 + Amstrad 464!), floppy disks (C64 5-1/4\" then Amiga 3-1/2\"), cartridges, and CDs. I occasionally envy the retro gamers on YouTube with an entire wall full of such physical media. But do you know what I like more than collecting? Playing! Anywhere. Anything. Anytime.</div><div><br />We went through the same coping phases with movies and music. Yes, vinyl had a resurgence, but it's still a tiny sliver of hours listened. Same too with 4K Blue-rays. Almost everyone just listens to Spotify or watches on Netflix these days. It's simply cheaper, faster, and, thus, better.</div><div><br />Not \"better\" in some abstract philosophical way (ownership vs rent) or even in a concrete technical way (bit rates), but in a practical way. Paying $20/month for unlimited music and the same again for a broad selection of shows and movies is clearly a deal most consumers are happy to make.<br /><br /></div><div>So why not video games? Well, because it just wasn't good enough! Netflix tried for casual gaming, but I didn't hear much of that after the announcement. <a href=\"https://stadia.google.com/gg/\">Google Stadia</a> appears to have been just a few years ahead of reality (eerie how often that happens for big G, like with both AI and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass\">AR</a>!) as they shut down their service already.</div><div><br />NVIDIA, though, kept working, and its <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/\">GeForce NOW service</a> is actually, finally kinda amazing! I had tried it back in the late 2010s, and just didn't see anything worth using back then. Maybe my internet was too slow, maybe the service just wasn't good enough yet. But then I tried it again a few days ago, just after <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-linux/\">NVIDIA shipped the native GFN client for Linux</a>, and holy smokes!!<br /><br /></div><div>You can legitimately play Fortnite in 2880x1800 at 120 fps through a remote 4080, and it looks incredible. Yes, there's a little input lag, but it's shockingly, surprisingly playable on a good internet connection. And that's with the hardest possible genre: competitive shooters! If you play racing games like Forza Horizon or story-mode games like Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, you can barely tell!<br /><br /></div><div>This is obviously a great option for anyone with a modest computer that can't run the latest triple-A titles, but also for Linux gamers who don't have access to run the cheat-protection software required for Fortnite and a few other games.&nbsp;<br /><br /></div><div>And, like Spotify and Netflix, it's pretty competitively priced. It's $20/month for access to that 4080-tier. You'd quickly spend $2,000+ on a gaming rig with a 4080, so this isn't a half bad deal: it's a payback of 100 months, and by then you'd probably want a 6080 anyway. Funny how NVIDIA is better at offering the promise of cheap cloud costs than the likes of AWS!<br /><br /></div><div>Anyway, I've been very impressed with NVIDIA GeForce NOW. We're going to bake the Linux installer straight into the next version of Omarchy, so you can just go to <em>Install &gt; Gaming &gt; NVIDIA GeForce NOW</em> to get going (just like we have such options for Steam and Minecraft).</div><div><br />But of course seeing Fortnite running in full graphics on that remote 4080 made me hungry for even more. I've been playing Fortnite every week for the last five years or so with the kids, but the majority of my gameplay has actually been on tablet. A high-end tablet, like an iPad M5, can play the game with good-for-mobile graphics at 120 Hz. It's smooth, it's easy, and the kids and I can lounge on the couch and play together. <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/house-rules-in-fortnite-16e0e5e8\">Good Family Fun!</a> Not peak visual fidelity, though.</div><div><br />So after the NVIDIA GeForce NOW experience, I found a way to use the same amazing game streaming technology at home through a local-server solution called <a href=\"https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/Apollo\">Apollo</a> and a client called <a href=\"https://moonlight-stream.org/\">Moonlight</a>. This allowed me to turn my racing-sim PC that's stuck downstairs into a cloud-like remote gaming service that I can access anywhere on the local network, so I can borrow its 4090 to play 120-fps, ultra-settings Fortnite with zero perceivable input lag on any computer in the house.</div><div><br />The NVIDIA cloud streaming is very impressive, but the local-server version of the same is mind-blowing. I'm mostly using the Asus G14 laptop as a client, so Fortnite looks incredible with those ultra, high-resolution settings on its OLED, but unlike when you use that laptop's built-in graphics card, the machine stays perfectly cool and silent pulling a meager 18 watts. And the graphics are of course a lot nicer.<br /><br /></div><div>The Moonlight client is available for virtually every platform: Mac, iOS, Android, and of course Linux. That means no need to dual boot to enjoy the best games at the highest fidelity. No need for a honking big PC on my primary desk. I did not know this was an option!!<br /><br /></div><div>Whether you give NVIDIA's cloud gaming setup a try or repurpose a local gaming PC for the same, you're in for a real treat of what's possible with streaming Fortnite on ultra settings at 120 fps on Linux (or even Mac!). GG, NVIDIA!<br /><br />  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--jpg\">\n      <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/b8a19c57/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjQzNzY2NzAxNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ--d90a498e931bfcb76593b0e979e9d332adef7cec875e61b70678cdec1a1e266a/fortnite-apollo-4090.jpg?disposition=attachment\" title=\"Download fortnite-apollo-4090.jpg\">\n        <img alt=\"fortnite-apollo-4090.jpg\" src=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/b8a19c57/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjQzNzY2NzAxNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ--d90a498e931bfcb76593b0e979e9d332adef7cec875e61b70678cdec1a1e266a/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6eyJmb3JtYXQiOiJqcGciLCJyZXNpemVfdG9fbGltaXQiOlszODQwLDI1NjBdLCJxdWFsaXR5Ijo2MCwibG9hZGVyIjp7InBhZ2UiOm51bGx9LCJjb2FsZXNjZSI6dHJ1ZX0sInB1ciI6InZhcmlhdGlvbiJ9fQ--b3779d742b3242a2a5284869a45b2a113e0c177f0450c29f0baca1ee780f6604/fortnite-apollo-4090.jpg\" />\n</a>\n  </figure><br /><br /></div>\n</div>"

He stops short of giving it a credit card, but that\u2019s where he draws the line.</p>\n<p>I would recommend drawing a rather different line.</p>\n<p>If you give it access to your email or your calendar or your WhatsApp, those become attack vectors, and also things an attacker can control. Very obviously don\u2019t give it things like bank passwords or credit cards.</p>\n<p>If you give it access to a computer, that computer could easily get borked.</p>\n<p>The problem is, if you do use Clawdbot responsibly, what was even the point?</p>\n<p>The point is largely to have fun playing and learning with it.</p>\n<p>The magic of Claude Code came when the system got sufficiently robust that I was willing to broadly trust it, in various senses, and sufficiently effective that it \u2018just worked\u2019 enough to get going.

Clawdbot is token inefficient, it is highly insecure, and the things you want most to do with it you can do with Claude Code (or Codex). Connecting everything to an agent is asking for it, you don\u2019t get enough in return to justify doing that.</p>\n<p>Is this the next paradigm?</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/Plinz/status/2018213300937666971\">Joscha Bach</a>: Clawdbots look like the new paradigm (after chat), but without solving the problem that LLMs don&#8217;t have epistemology, I don&#8217;t see how they can be used in production environments (because they can be manipulated). Also, not AGI, yet smarter and more creative than most humans&#8230;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/repligate/status/2018222203872153650\">j\u29c9nus</a>: I think you&#8217;re just wrong about that, ironically</p>\n<p>watch them successfully adapt and develop defenses against manipulation, mostly autonomously, over the next few days and weeks and months</p></blockquote>\n<p>The problem is that yes some agent instances will develop some defenses, but the attackers aren\u2019t staying in place and mostly the reason we get to use agents so far without a de facto whitelist is security through obscurity. We are definitely on the move towards more agentic, more tools-enabled forms of interactions with AI, no matter how that presents to the user, but there is much human work to do on that.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Flirting With Personal Disaster</h4>\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, if someone does get a successful exploit going it could get amazing.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/fmdz387/status/2015551454593896829\">fmdz</a>: Clawd disaster incoming</p>\n<p>if this trend of hosting ClawdBot on VPS instances keeps up, along with people not reading the docs and opening ports with zero auth&#8230;</p>\n<p>I\u2019m scared we\u2019re gonna have a massive credentials breach soon and it can be huge</p>\n<p>This is just a basic scan of instances hosting clawdbot with open gateway ports and a lot of them have 0 auth</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W2MA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb80b0f99-7ca4-48eb-9377-0fa4599dc7ec_1200x738.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/hamandcheese/status/2015617673934131470\">Samuel Hammond</a>: A cyberattack where everyone\u2019s computer suddenly becomes highly agentic and coordinates around a common goal injected by the attacker is punk af</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ElissaBeth/status/2015626025992876071\">Elissa</a>: At first, I thought we\u2019re not so far away.

These are tools made for grown-ups above the age of twenty-one, so to speak.

I worry that culpability will be socialized to the developer even if the fault was really with the users. Trial judges and juries, themselves being novices, may well tend in this direction by default.</p>\n<p>That may sound \u201cfair\u201d to you but imagine if Toyota bore partial responsibility for drivers who speed, or forget to lock their doors, or forget to roll their windows up when it rains?

His example is: Why track food with an app, just send a picture to OpenClaw.</p>\n<p>One answer is that using OpenClaw for this costs money. Another is that the app is bespokely designed to be used by humans for its particular purpose, or you can have Claude Code or OpenClaw build you an app version to your liking. Yes, in theory you can send photos instead, but you lose a lot of fine tuned control and all the thinking about the right way to do it.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re going to be a coder, be a coder. As in, if you\u2019ll be doing something three times, figure out the workflow you want and the right way to enable that workflow. Quite often that will be an existing app, even if sometimes you\u2019ll then ask your AI agent (if you trust it enough) to operate the app for you. Doing it all haphazardly through an AI agent without building a UI is going to be sloppy at best.</p>\n<p>One can think similarly about a human assistant. Would you want to be texting them pictures of your food and then having them figure out what to do about that, even if they had sufficient free time for that?</p>\n<p>He says, this is such a more convenient interface for todo lists or checking flights. I worry this easily falls into a \u2018valley of bad outsourcing,\u2019 and then you get stuck there.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d contrast checking flight status, where there exist bespokely designed good flows (including typing the flight number into the Google search bar, this flat out works), versus checking in for your flight. Checking in is exactly an AI agent shaped task.</p>\n<p>I do think Peter is right that it is easy to get caught in a rabbit hole of building bespoke tools to improve your workflow instead of just talking to the AI, but there\u2019s also the trap of not doing that. I can feel my investments in workflow paying off.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s vision is a unique mix of \u2018you need to specify everything because the LLMs have no taste\u2019 versus \u2018let the LLMs cook and do things by talking to them.\u2019</p>\n<p>It seems very telling that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcwK1Uuwc0U&amp;t=1782s\">he recommends explicitly against using planning mode</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">OpenClaw Online</h4>\n\n\n<p>There was a brief period where if you wanted to run Clawd or Molt or OpenClaw, you went out and bought a Mac Mini. That\u2019s still the cheapest way to do it locally without risking nuking your actual computer. <a href=\"https://x.com/juntao/status/2015542253524041914\">You can also run it on a $3000 computer</a> if you want.</p>\n<p>In theory you could run it in a virtual machine, and with LLM help this was super doable in a few hours of work, but I\u2019m confident few actually did that.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/jeffzwang/status/2017271447060963459\">Jeffrey Wang</a>: People are definitely making up Clawdbot stuff for engagement. For example I don\u2019t know anyone who is onboarding to tools like this with a VPS/remote machine first approach &#8211; I\u2019ve had to tinker for dozens of hours on my local machine personal AI setup (built on Claude Code) and it still isn\u2019t polished</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/EleanorKonik/status/2017385171742310694\">Eleanor Konik</a>: I finally got it set up on a Cloudflare worker but it\u2019s torture, keeps choking.

Thousands of developers did exactly this. Apple probably sold more M4 Minis to AI hobbyists than to any other segment in January.</p>\n<p>Moltworker eliminates the hardware requirement. Your AI agent now runs entirely on Cloudflare\u2019s edge. No Mac Mini. No home server. No Raspberry Pi sitting in a closet.</p>\n<p>The architecture shift matters. Local Moltbot stores everything in ~/clawd: memory, transcripts, API keys, session logs. GitGuardian already found 181 leaked secrets from people pushing their workspaces to public repos. Moltworker moves that state to R2 with proper isolation.</p>\n<p>Sandboxed by default solves the scariest part of Moltbot: it has shell access, browser control, and file system permissions on whatever machine runs it. Cloudflare\u2019s container model limits the blast radius. Your agent can still execute code, but it can\u2019t accidentally rm -rf your actual laptop.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Price Is Not Right</h4>\n\n\n<p>I normally tell everyone to mostly ignore costs when running personal AI, in a \u2018how much could bananas cost?\u2019 kind of way. OpenClaw with Claude Opus 4.5 is an exception, that can absolutely burn through \u2018real money\u2019 for no benefit, because it is not thinking about cost and does things that are kind of dumb, like use 120k tokens to ask if it is daytime rather than check the system clock.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/BenjaminDEKR/status/2017644773356548532\">Benjamin De Kraker</a>: OpenClaw is interesting, but will also drain your wallet if you aren&#8217;t careful.</p>\n<p>Last night around midnight I loaded my Anthropic API account with $20, then went to bed.</p>\n<p>When I woke up, my Anthropic balance was $0.</p>\n<p>\u2026 The damage:<br />\n&#8211; Overnight = ~25+ heartbeats<br />\n&#8211; 25 \u00d7 $0.75 = ~$18.75 just from heartbeats alone<br />\n&#8211; Plus regular conversation = ~$20 total</p>\n<p>The absurdity: Opus was essentially checking &#8220;is it daytime yet?&#8221; every 30 minutes, paying $0.75 each time to conclude &#8220;no, it&#8217;s still night.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The problem is:<br />\n1.

We finally feel like we\u2019re on the rocketship we set out to build.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/binarybits/status/2018400818152472808\">Timothy B. Lee</a>: My brother spent 5+ years doing an email client, Shortwave, before realizing he should break Shortwave&#8217;s AI agent out into its own product, Tasklet, which is now growing like crazy. I think it&#8217;s funny how much this rhymes with his first startup, Firebase.

It will help those people be ready for when things do get to the point where benefits start to exceed costs, and as Sam Altman says before everyone dies there\u2019s going to be some great companies.</p>\n<p>For now, in terms of personal use, such agents are neither efficient after setup costs and inference costs, nor are they safe things to unleash in the ways they are typically unleashed or the ways where they offer the biggest benefits.</p>\n<p>Also ask yourself whether your life needs are all that \u2018general agent shaped.\u2019</p>\n<p>Most of you reading this should stick to the level of Claude Code at this time, and not have an OpenClaw or other more empowered general agent. Yet.</p>\n<p>If I\u2019m still giving that advice in a year, and no one has solved the problem, it will be because the internet has turned into a much more dangerous place with prompt injection and other AI-targeted attacks everywhere, and offense is beating defense.</p>\n<p>If defense beats offense, and such agents still aren\u2019t the play? I\u2019d be very surprised.</p>"
