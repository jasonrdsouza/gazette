                "<p>Many cities have regular Astral Codex Ten meetup groups. Twice a year, I try to advertise their upcoming meetups and make a bigger deal of it than usual so that irregular attendees can attend and new readers can hear about the meetups. This is one of those times.</p><p>This year we have meetups planned in over a hundred and eighty cities, from Alberta, Canada to Wellington, New Zealand. Thanks to all the organizers who responded to my request for details, and to Meetups Czar Skyler and the Less Wrong team for making this happen.</p><p>You can find the list below, in the following order:</p><ol><li><p>Africa &amp; Middle East</p></li><li><p>Asia-Pacific (including Australia)</p></li><li><p>Europe (including UK)</p></li><li><p>North America &amp; Central America</p></li><li><p>South America</p></li></ol><p>There should shortly be a map of these meetups on<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/community\"> the LessWrong community page</a>.</p><p>Within each region it&#8217;s alphabetized first by country then by city - so the first entry in Europe is Graz, <strong>A</strong>ustria. The exception is the USA, where they&#8217;re also alphabetized by state - so the first entry in the USA is Huntsville, <strong>A</strong>labama.</p><p>I&#8217;ll provisionally be attending the Berkeley meetup. </p><p><strong>Extra Info For Potential Attendees</strong></p><p><strong>1. </strong>If you&#8217;re reading this, you&#8217;re invited. Please don&#8217;t feel like you &#8220;won&#8217;t be welcome&#8221; just because you&#8217;re new to the blog, demographically different from the average reader, or hate ACX and everything it stands for. You&#8217;ll be fine! (Though I do try not to pick people who hate ACX to run the meetups.)<br /> <strong>2</strong>. You don&#8217;t have to RSVP or contact the organizer to be able to attend (unless the event description says otherwise!) RSVPs are mostly to give organizers a better sense of how many people might show up, and let them tell you if there are last-second changes. I&#8217;ve also given email addresses or other contact information for organizers in case you have a question.<br /><strong>3.</strong> If you have any feedback on the meetup (compliments, complaints, curiosities, etc) the feedback form is here: <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/acx-meetup-survey\">tinyurl.com/acx-meetup-survey </a>.</p><p><strong>Extra Info For Meetup Organizers:<br /><br />1.</strong> If you&#8217;re the host, bring a sign that says &#8220;ACX MEETUP&#8221; and prop it up somewhere (or otherwise be identifiable).<br /><strong>2. </strong>Bring blank labels and pens for nametags.<br /><strong>3. </strong>If you&#8217;re having trouble thinking of something to talk about, the attendees probably also read ACX. Ask people about a recent post or book review that they liked.<br /><strong>4.</strong> If it&#8217;s the first meetup, people are probably just going to want to talk, and you shouldn&#8217;t try to organize some kind of planned workshop or anything like that.<br /><strong>5.</strong> Have people type their name and email address in a spreadsheet or in a Google Form (accessed via a bit.ly link or QR code), so you can start a mailing list to make organizing future meetups easier.<br /><strong>6.</strong> It&#8217;s easier to schedule a followup meetup while you&#8217;re having the first, compared to trying to do it later on by email.<br /><strong>7.</strong> If you didn&#8217;t make a LessWrong event for your meetup (or if you did but Skyler didn&#8217;t know about it) the LessWrong team did it for you using the username or email address you gave on the form. To claim your event, log into LW (or create an account) using that email address, or message the LW team on Intercom (chat button in the bottom right corner of lesswrong.com).</p><p>If you need to change a meetup date or you have any other questions, please email skyler[at]rationalitymeetups[ period]org.</p><h2>Africa &amp; The Middle East</h2><h3>Israel</h3><h5>RISHON LEZION</h5><p>Contact: Anatoly Vorobey<br />Contact Info: avorobey[a t]gmail[period]com<br />Time: Thursday, September 18th, 6:00 PM<br />Location: Tables just behind the playground located behind the municipal court building, Meishar street<br />Coordinates: <a href=\"https://plus.codes/8G3PXQ9J+G9\">https://plus.codes/8G3PXQ9J+G9</a></p><h5>TEL AVIV</h5><p>Contact: Inbar<br />Contact Info: inbar192[a t]gmail[period]com<br />Time: Sunday, October 12th, 5:00 PM<br />Location: Sarona market, at grass area next to Benedict.

                "<p>The Trump administration has been <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8denvzl0y8o\">retaliating against its critics</a>, and people and groups with business before the administration have started laundering criticism through other sources with less need for goodwill. So I have been asked to share <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EasYbeIRB9b-rS4Em5PcnYAeiWyXXzkzFhl03ebEpTQ/edit?tab=t.0\">an open letter</a>, which needs signatures from scientists, doctors, and healthcare professionals.

We would rather be members of a large crowd of signatories than be singled out as individuals to make an example of. Based on our understanding of current administration norms, we do not expect retaliation against private individuals who sign this letter.</p><p>We are looking for signatures from scientists, doctors, and healthcare professionals. So if that is you, please sign <strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpeZ_3tICwuiPYli1rMe2A4T1gZ0BFZY7JrccWeSyAfUaREg/viewform\">here</a></strong>.

Our stretch goal is to have a thousand people sign the letter within the next two weeks.</p></blockquote><p>To hammer home (since many people failed to understand it) that this is not the contents of the letter, I am including the actual contents below:</p><blockquote><p>We, the undersigned scientists, doctors, and public health stakeholders, commend your commitment to spend all funds allocated to the NIH, as reported in The Washington Post. At the same time, we are concerned by reports that U.S. institutions received nearly $5 billion less in NIH awards over the past year. With less than one month to the end of the fiscal year, we submit this urgent request to ensure that your commitment is upheld. If you anticipate that all appropriated funds cannot be spent in time, we request a public disclosure of the barriers preventing the achievement of this crucial responsibility.</p><p>We present this request in the spirit of the broad, bipartisan consensus in favor of spending appropriated NIH funds. In their July letter to the Office of Management and Budget, fourteen Republican senators, led by Senators Collins, Britt, and McConnell, forcefully argued that suspension of NIH funds &#8220;could threaten Americans' ability to access better treatments and limit our nation's leadership in biomedical science.&#8221; The case for investment in medical research transcends political divides as it serves our collective national interest.</p><p>The return on investment from research is compelling. Synthesizing the empirical literature, economist Matt Clancy estimates that each public and private R&amp;D dollar yields roughly $5.50 in GDP&#8212;and about $11 when broader benefits are counted. Every dollar of NIH funding not deployed represents lost opportunities for breakthrough treatments, missed chances to train the next generation of scientists, and diminished returns on America's innovation ecosystem.</p><p>Spending these funds is also a competitiveness imperative as China attempts to transform itself from a low-end manufacturer to a high-tech research and innovation juggernaut. In 2024, the Chinese government increased its spending on science and technology by 10%, and the nation&#8217;s total expenditure on research and development increased by 50% in nominal terms between 2020 and 2024. As China&#8217;s number of clinical trials and new drug candidates begin to outpace the U.S., America cannot afford to allow biomedical research funding to go unspent.</p><p>We respectfully ask that you ensure that NIH will obligate all FY25 funds by September 30, 2025, and, if that is not possible, that you address the scientific community to explain why and what must be done to ensure all appropriated funds are spent in FY26. We stand ready to support your efforts to preserve this vital national investment.</p></blockquote><p>You can sign the letter <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpeZ_3tICwuiPYli1rMe2A4T1gZ0BFZY7JrccWeSyAfUaREg/viewform\">here</a>.</p>"

Remember the fees they\u2019re extorting from Nvidia and AMD.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Scott Lincicome: I defy you to read these paras and not see the risks &#8211; distorted decision-making, silenced shareholders, coerced customers, etc &#8211; raised by this deal. And it&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>\n<p>FT: Intel said the government would purchase the shares at $20.47 each, below Friday\u2019s closing price of $24.80, but about the level where they traded early in August. Intel\u2019s board had approved the deal, which does not need shareholder approval, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>\n<p>The US will also receive a five-year warrant, which allows it to purchase an additional 5 per cent of the group at $20 a share. The warrant will only come good if Intel jettisons majority ownership of its foundry business, which makes chips for other companies.</p>\n<p>Some investors have pushed for Intel to cut its losses and fully divest its manufacturing unit. Intel chief Lip-Bu Tan, who took the reins in March, has so far remained committed to keeping it, albeit with a warning that he could withdraw from the most advanced chipmaking if he was unable to land big customers.</p>\n<p>Scott Lincicome: Also, this is wild: by handing over the equity stake to the US govt, Intel no longer has to meet the CHIPS Act conditions (i.e., building US-based fabs) that, if met, would allow them to access the remaining billions in taxpayer funds?!?! Industrial policy FTW, again.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/scottlincicome/status/1958990231916441886\">Washington will be</a> Intel&#8217;s single largest shareholder, and have a massive political/financial interest in the company&#8217;s operations here and abroad. If you think this share will remain passive, I&#8217;ve got an unfinished chip factory in Ohio to sell you.</p>\n<p>Narrator: it turns out the share isn&#8217;t even that passive to begin with.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/08/24/trump-intel-government-marketplace/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzU2MDA4MDAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzU3MzkwMzk5LCJpYXQiOjE3NTYwMDgwMDAsImp0aSI6IjlhMzRmOGJiLTAwZjEtNDA2OC04NzkzLWE5YzRmZjM1ZTQ4ZSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy8yMDI1LzA4LzI0L3RydW1wLWludGVsLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtbWFya2V0cGxhY2UvIn0.KGY1mGTIkTtFzVt2NrFolacVVjcJvXSae4hdVgY45Xs\">Scott also offers us this opinion in Washington Post Editorial form</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/RealJacobPerry/status/1959004142707646650\">Jacob Perry</a>: Basically, Intel gave 10% of its equity to the President of the United States just to ensure he would leave them alone. There&#8217;s a term for this but I can&#8217;t think of it at the moment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/NikkiHaley/status/1959314528560169117\">Nikki Haley</a> (remember her?): Biden was wrong to subsidize the private sector with the Chips Act using our tax dollars. The counter to Biden is not to lean in and have govt own part of Intel. This will only lead to more government subsidies and less productivity. Intel will become a test case of what not to do.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As is usually the case, the more details you look at, the worse it gets. This deal does give Intel something in return, but that something is letting Intel off the hook on its commitments to build new plants, so that seems worse yet again.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://t.co/CquxXe6SQt\">Samsung is reportedly</a> \u2018exploring partnerships with American companies to \u2018please\u2019 the Trump administration and ensure that its regional operations aren\u2019t affected by hefty tariffs.\u2019</p>\n<p>To be clear: And That\u2019s Terrible.</p>\n<p>Tyler Cowen writes against this move, leaving no doubt as to the implications and vibes by saying <a href=\"https://www.thefp.com/p/tyler-cowen-trump-seizes-the-means-of-production-at-intel\">Trump Seizes the Means of Production at Intel</a>. He quite rightfully does not mince words. A good rule of thumb these days is if Tyler Cowen outright says a Trump move was no good and very bad, the move is both importantly damaging and completely indefensible.</p>\n<p>Is there a steelman of this?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/u-s-intel/\">Ben Thompson says yes, and he\u2019s the man to provide it</a>, and despite agreeing that Lincicome makes great points he actually supports the deal. This surprised me, since Ben is normally very much ordinary business uber alles, and he clearly appreciates all the reasons such an action is terrible.</p>\n<p>So why, despite all the reasons this is terrible, does Ben support doing it anyway?</p>\n<p>Ben presents the problem as the need for Intel to make wise long term decisions towards being competitive and relevant in the 2030s, and that it would take too long for other companies to fill the void if Intel failed, especially without a track record. Okay, sure, I can\u2019t confirm but let\u2019s say that\u2019s fair.</p>\n<p>Next, Ben says that Intel\u2019s chips and process are actually pretty good, certainly good enough to be useful, and the problem is that Intel can\u2019t credibly promise to stick around to be a long term partner. Okay, sure, again, I can\u2019t confirm but let\u2019s say that\u2019s true.</p>\n<p>Ben\u2019s argument is next that Intel\u2019s natural response to this problem is to give up and become another TSMC customer, but that is against America\u2019s strategic interests.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ben Thompson: A standalone Intel cannot credibly make this promise.</p>\n<p>The path of least resistance for Intel has always been to simply give up manufacturing and become another TSMC customer; they already fab some number of their chips with the Taiwanese giant. Such a decision would \u2014 after some <em>very</em> difficult write-offs and wind-down operations \u2014 change the company into a much higher margin business; yes, the company\u2019s chip designs have fallen behind as well, but at least they would be on the most competitive process, with a lot of their legacy customer base still on their side.</p>\n<p>The problem for the U.S. is that that then means pinning all of the country\u2019s long-term chip fabrication hopes on TSMC and Samsung not just building fabs in the United States, but also building up a credible organization in the U.S. that could withstand the loss of their headquarters and engineering knowhow in their home countries. <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/tesla-and-samsung-customer-service-and-intel-the-u-s-semi-supply-chain/\"><strong>There have been some important steps in this regard</strong></a>, but at the end of the day it seems reckless for the U.S. to place both its national security and its entire economy in the hands of foreign countries next door to China, allies or not.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Once again, I cannot confirm the economics but seems reasonable on both counts. We would like Intel to stand on its own and not depend on TSMC for national security reasons, and to do that Intel has to be able to be a credible partner.</p>\n<p>The next line is where he loses me:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Given all of this, acquiring 10% of Intel, terrible though it may be for all of the reasons Lincicome articulates \u2014 and I haven\u2019t even touched on the legality of this move \u2014 is I think the least bad option.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Why does America extorting a 10% passive stake in Intel solve these problems, rather than make things worse for all the reasons Lincicome describes?</p>\n<p>Because he sees \u2018America will distort the free market and strongarm Intel into making chips and other companies into buying Intel chips\u2019 as an advantage, basically?</p>\n<p>So much for this being a passive stake in Intel. This is saying Intel has been nationalized. We are going the CCP route of telling Intel how to run its business, to pursue an entirely different corporate strategy or else. We are going the CCP route of forcing companies to buy from the newly state-owned enterprise. And that this is good. Private capital should be forced to prioritize what we care about more.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not the reason Trump says he is doing this, which is more \u2018I was offered the opportunity to extort $10 billion in value and I love making deals\u2019 and now he\u2019s looking for other similar \u2018deals\u2019 to make if you know what\u2019s good for you, as it seems <a href=\"https://x.com/DeItaone/status/1960006471342776816\">extortion of equity in private businesses is new official White House policy?</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>Walter Bloomberg: <img alt=\"\ud83d\udea8\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f6a8.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /> TRUMP ON U.S. STAKES IN COMPANIES: I WANT TO TRY TO GET AS MUCH AS I CAN</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is hard to overstate how much worse this is than simply raising corporate tax rates.</p>\n<p>As in, no Intel is not a special case. But let\u2019s get back to Intel as a special case, if in theory it was a special case, and you hoped to contain the damage to American free enterprise and willingness to invest capital and so on that comes from the constant threat of extortion and success being chosen by fiat, or what Republicans used to call \u2018picking winners and losers\u2019 except with the quiet part being said out loud.</p>\n<p>Why do you need or want to take a stake in Intel in order to do all this? We really want to be strongarming American companies into making the investment and purchasing decisions the government wants? If this is such a strategic priority, why not do this with purchase guarantees, loan guarantees and other subsidies? It would not be so difficult to make it clear Intel will not be allowed to fail except if it outright failed to deliver the chips, which isn\u2019t something that we can guard against either way.</p>\n<p>Why do we think <a href=\"https://babylonbee.com/news/trump-vows-to-nationalize-as-many-private-companies-as-it-takes-to-defeat-socialism\">socialism with Trumpian characteristics</a> is the answer here?</p>\n<p>I\u2019m fine with the idea that Intel needs to be Too Big To Fail, and it should be the same kind of enterprise as Chase Bank. But there\u2019s a reason we aren\u2019t extorting a share of Chase Bank and then forcing customers to choose Chase Bank or else. Unless we are. If I was Jamie Dimon I\u2019d be worried that we\u2019re going to try? Or worse, that we\u2019re going to do it to Citibank first?</p>\n<p>That was the example that came to mind first, but it turns out <a href=\"https://x.com/krassenstein/status/1960321995578458559\">Trump\u2019s next target for extortion looks to be Lockheed Martin</a>. Does this make you want to invest in strategically important American companies?</p>\n<p>As a steelman exercise of taking the stake in Intel, Ben Thompson\u2019s attempt is good. That is indeed as good a steelman as I\u2019ve been or can come up with, so great job.</p>\n<p>Except that even with all that, even the good version of taking the stake would still be a terrible idea, you can simply do all this without taking the stake.</p>\n<p>And even if the Ben Thompson steelman version of the plan was the least bad option? That\u2019s not what we are doing here, as evidenced by \u2018I want to try and get as much as I can\u2019 in stakes in other companies. This isn\u2019t a strategic plan to create customer confidence that Intel will be considered Too Big To Fail. It\u2019s the start of a pattern of extortion.</p>\n<p>Thus, 10 out of 10 for making a good steelman but minus ten million for actually supporting the move for real?</p>\n<p>Again, there\u2019s a correct and legal way for the American government to extort American companies, and it\u2019s called taxes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/08/the-history-of-american-corporate-nationalization.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-history-of-american-corporate-nationalization\">Tyler Cowen wrote this passage</a> on The History of American corporate nationalization for another project a while back, emphasizing how much America benefits from not nationalizing companies and playing favorites.

For context, I remember talking to a congressional staffer a few months ago who basically said that a16z was spending on the order of $100M on lobbying and that this amount was enough to make basically every politician think &#8220;hmm, I can raise a lot more if I just do what a16z wants&#8221; and that many did end up doing just that. I was, and am, disheartened to hear how easily US government policy can be purchased.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So now we can double that. They\u2019re (perhaps legally, this is our system) buying the government, or at least quite a lot of influence on it. As usual, it\u2019s not that everyone has a price but that the price is so cheap.</p>\n<p>As per usual, the plan is to frame \u2018any regulation whatsoever, at all, of any kind\u2019 as \u2018you want to slow down AI and Lose To China.\u2019</p>\n<blockquote><p>WSJ: \u201cThere is a vast force out there that\u2019s looking to slow down AI deployment, prevent the American worker from benefiting from the U.S. leading in global innovation and job creation and erect a patchwork of regulation,\u201d Josh Vlasto and Zac Moffatt, the group\u2019s leaders, said in a joint statement. \u201cThis is the ecosystem that is going to be the counterforce going into next year.\u201d</p>\n<p>The new network, one of the first of its kind focusing on AI policy, hopes to emulate Fairshake, a cryptocurrency-focused super-PAC network.</p>\n<p>\u2026 Other backers include 8VC managing partner and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PLTR\">Palantir Technologies</a> co-founder Joe Lonsdale, AI search engine Perplexity and veteran angel investor Ron Conway.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Industry, and a16z in particular, were already flooding everyone with money. The only difference is now they are coordinating better, and pretending less, and spending more?</p>\n<p>They continue to talk about \u2018vast forces\u2019 opposing the actual vast force, which was always industry and the massive dollars behind it. The only similarly vast forces are that the public really hates AI, and the physical underlying reality of AI\u2019s future.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Many tech executives worry that Congress won\u2019t pass AI rules, creating a patchwork of state laws that hurt their companies. Earlier this year, a push by some Republicans to ban state AI bills for 10 years <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/how-a-bold-plan-to-ban-state-ai-laws-fell-apartand-divided-trumpworld-96bce19d?mod=article_inline\">was shot down</a> after opposition from other conservatives who opposed a blanket prohibition on any state AI legislation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And there it is, right in the article, as text. What they are worried about is that we won\u2019t pass a law that says we aren\u2019t allowed to pass any laws.</p>\n<p>If you think \u2018Congress won\u2019t pass AI laws\u2019 is a call for Congress to pass reasonable AI laws, point to the reasonable AI laws anyone involved has ever said a kind word about, let alone proposed or supported.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The group\u2019s launch coincides with concerns about the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/artificial-intelligence-us-vs-china-03372176?mod=article_inline\">staying ahead </a>of China in the AI race, while Washington has largely shied away from tackling AI policies.</p></blockquote>\n<p>No it doesn\u2019t? These \u2018concerns about China\u2019 peaked around January. There has been no additional reason for such concerns in months that wasn\u2019t at least priced in, other than acts of self-sabotage of American energy production.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Quest for Sane Regulations</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hyperdimensional.co/p/whats-up-with-the-states\">Dean Ball goes over various bills introduced in various states</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dean Ball: After sorting out the anodyne laws, there remain only several dozen bills that are substantively regulatory. To be clear, that is still a <em>lot </em>of potential regulation, but it is also not \u201c1,000 bills.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are always tons of bills. The trick is to notice which ones actually do anything and also have a chance of becoming law. That\u2019s always a much smaller group.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The most notable trend since I last wrote about these issues is that states have decidedly stepped back from efforts to \u201ccomprehensively\u201d regulate AI.</p></blockquote>\n<p>By \u2018comprehensively regulate\u2019 Dean means the Colorado-style or EU-style use-based approaches, which we both agree is quite terrible. Dean instead focuses on two other approaches more in vogue now.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Several states have banned (see also \u201cregulated,\u201d \u201cput guardrails on\u201d for the polite phraseology) the use of AI for mental health services.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>If the law stopped here, I\u2019d be <em>fine </em>with it; not supportive, not hopeful about the likely outcomes, but <em>fine </em>nonetheless.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I agree with Dean that I don\u2019t support that idea, I think it is net harmful, but if you want to talk to an AI you can still talk to an AI, so so far it\u2019s not a big deal.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But the Nevada law, <a href=\"https://ilga.gov/Legislation/BillStatus/FullText?GAID=18&amp;DocNum=1806&amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;LegId=159219&amp;SessionID=114\">and a similar law passed in Illinois</a>, goes further than that. They also impose regulations on AI developers, stating that it is illegal for them to explicitly or implicitly claim of their models that (quoting from the Nevada law):</p>\n<p>(a) The artificial intelligence system is capable of providing professional mental or behavioral health care;</p>\n<p>(b) A user of the artificial intelligence system may interact with any feature of the artificial intelligence system which simulates human conversation in order to obtain professional mental or behavioral health care; or</p>\n<p>(c) The artificial intelligence system, or any component, feature, avatar or embodiment of the artificial intelligence system is a provider of mental or behavioral health care, a therapist, a clinical therapist, a counselor, a psychiatrist, a doctor or any other term commonly used to refer to a provider of professional mental health or behavioral health care.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Did I mention recently that nothing I say in this column is investment or financial advice, legal advice, tax advice or psychological, mental health, nutritional, dietary or medical advice? And just in case, I\u2019m also not ever giving anyone engineering, structural, real estate, insurance, immigration or veterinary advice.</p>\n<p>Because you must understand that indeed nothing I have ever said, in any form, ever in my life, has been any of those things, nor do I ever offer or perform any related services.</p>\n<p>I would never advise you to say the same, because that might be legal advice.</p>\n<p>Similarly, it sounds like AI companies would under these laws most definitely also not be saying their AIs can provide mental health advice or services? Okay, sure, I mean annoying but whatever?</p>\n<blockquote><p>But there is something deeper here, too. Nevada AB 406, and its similar companion in Illinois, deal with AI in mental healthcare by simply pretending it does not exist. \u201cSure, AI may be a useful tool for organizing information,\u201d these legislators seem to be saying, \u201cbut only a human could ever do <em>mental healthcare.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>And then there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Americans who use chatbots for something that resembles mental healthcare every day. <em>Should </em>those people be using language models in this way? If they cannot afford a therapist, is it better that they talk to a low-cost chatbot, or no one at all? Up to what point of mental distress? What should or could the developers of language models do to ensure that their products do the right thing in mental health-related contexts? <em>What is the right thing to do</em>?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Technically via the definition here it is mental healthcare to \u2018detect\u2019 that someone might be (among other things) intoxicated, but obviously that is not going to stop me or anyone else from observing that a person is drunk, nor are we going to have to face a licensing challenge if we do so. I would hope. This whole thing is deeply stupid.</p>\n<p>So I would presume the right thing to do is to use the best tools available, including things that \u2018resemble\u2019 \u2018mental healthcare.\u2019 We simply don\u2019t call it mental healthcare.</p>\n<p>Similarly, what happens when Illinois HB 1806 says this (as quoted by Dean):</p>\n<blockquote><p>An individual, corporation, or entity may not provide, advertise, or otherwise offer therapy or psychotherapy services, including through the use of Internet-based artificial intelligence, to the public in this State unless the therapy or psychotherapy services are conducted by an individual who is a licensed professional.</p>\n<p>Dean Ball: How, exactly, would an AI company comply with this? In the most utterly simple example, imagine that a user says to an LLM \u201cI am feeling depressed and lonely today. Help me improve my mood.\u201d The States of Illinois and Nevada have decided that the optimal experience for their residents is for an AI to refuse to assist them in this basic request for help.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My obvious response is, if this means an AI can\u2019t do it, it also means a friend cannot do it either? Which means that if they say \u2018I am feeling depressed and lonely today. Help me improve my mood\u2019 you have to say \u2018I am sorry, I cannot do that, because I am not a licensed health professional any more than Claude Opus is\u2019? I mean presumably this is not how it works. Nor would it change if they were somehow paying me?</p>\n<p>Dean\u2019s argument is that this is the point:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But the point of these laws isn\u2019t so much to be applied evenly; it is to be <em>enforced</em>, aggressively, by government bureaucrats against deep-pocketed companies, while protecting entrenched interest groups (licensed therapists and public school staff) from technological competition. In this sense these laws resemble little more than the protection schemes of mafiosi and other organized criminals.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There\u2019s a kind of whiplash here that I am used to when reading such laws. I don\u2019t care if it is impossible to comply in the law if fully enforced in a maximally destructive and perverse way unless someone is suggesting this will actually happen. If the laws are only going to get enforced when you actively try to offer therapist chatbots?</p>\n<p>Then yes it would be better to write better laws, and I don\u2019t especially want to protect those people\u2019s roles at all, but we don\u2019t need to talk about what happens if the AI gets told to help improve someone\u2019s mood and the AI suggests going for a walk. Nor would I expect a challenge to that to survive on constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p>More dear to my heart, and more important, are bills about Frontier AI Safety. He predicts SB 53 will become law in California, here is his summary of SB 53:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Requires developers of the largest AI models to publish a \u201csafety and security protocol\u201d describing the developers\u2019 process of measuring, evaluating, and mitigating catastrophic risks (risks in which single incidents result in the death of more than 50 people or more than $1 billion in property damage) and dangerous capabilities (expert-level bioweapon or cyberattack advice/execution, engaging in murder, assault, extortion, theft, and the like, and evading developer control).</li>\n<li>Requires developers to report to the California Attorney General \u201ccritical safety incidents,\u201d which includes theft of model weights (assuming a closed-source model), loss of control over a foundation model resulting in injury or death, any materialization of a catastrophic risk (as defined above), model deception of developers (when the developer is not conducting experiments to try to elicit model deception), or any time a model first crosses dangerous capability thresholds as defined by their developers.</li>\n<li>Requires developers to submit to an annual third-party audit, verifying that they comply with <em>their own </em>safety and security protocols, starting after 2030.</li>\n<li>Creates whistleblower protections for the employees of the large developers covered by the bill.</li>\n<li>Creates a consortium that is charged with \u201cdeveloping a framework\u201d for a public compute cluster (\u201cCalCompute\u201d) owned by the State of California, because for political reasons, Scott Wiener still must pretend like he believes California can afford a public compute cluster. This is unlikely to ever happen, but you can safely ignore this provision of the law; it does not do much or authorize much spending.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The RAISE Act lacks the audit provision described in item (3) above as well as an analogous public compute section (though New York does have <a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-40-million-launch-empire-ai-beta-supercomputer\">its own public compute program</a>). Other than that it mostly aligns with this sketch of SB 53 I have given.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>AI policy challenges us to contemplate questions like this, or at least it should. I don\u2019t think SB 53 or RAISE deliver especially compelling answers. At the end of the day, however, these are laws about the management of tail risks\u2014a task governments should take seriously\u2014and I find the tail risks they focus on to be believable enough.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There is a sharp contrast between this skeptical and nitpicky and reluctant but highly respectful Dean Ball, versus the previous Dean Ball reaction to SB 1047. He still has some objections and concerns, which he discusses. I am more positive on the bills than he is, especially in terms of seeing the benefits, but I consider Dean\u2019s reaction here high praise.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In SB 53 and RAISE, the drafters have shown respect for technical reality, (mostly) reasonable intellectual humility appropriate to an emerging technology, and a measure of legislative restraint. Whether you agree with the substance or not, I believe all of this is worthy of applause.</p>\n<p>Might it be possible to pass relatively non-controversial, yet substantive, <em>frontier AI policy </em>in the United States? Just maybe.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chip City</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1960800345329721796\">Nvidia reported earnings of $46.7 billion</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/levie/status/1960807122666709242\">growing 56% in a year,</a> beating both revenue and EPS expectations, and was promptly down 5% in after hours trading, although it recovered and was only down 0.82% on Thursday.

Which makes it rather strange to choose to sell worse, and thus less expensive and less profitable, chips to China rather than instead making better chips to sell to the West. That holds double if you have uncertainty on both ends, where the Americans might not let you sell the chips and the Chinese might not be willing to buy them.</p>\n<p>Also, even Ben Thompson, who has called for selling even our best chips to China because he cares more about Nvidia market share than who owns compute, noticed that H20s would sell out if Nvidia offered them for sale elsewhere:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ben Thompson: One note while I\u2019m here: when the Trump administration <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/nvidia-h20-restricted-in-china-the-huawei-cloudmatrix-384-whither-chip-controls/\"><strong>first put a pause</strong></a> on H20 sales, I said that no one outside of China would want them; several folks noted that actually several would-be customers would be happy to buy H20s for the prices Nvidia was selling them to China, specifically for inference workloads, but Nvidia refused.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Instead they chose a $5 billion writedown. We are being played.</p>\n<p>Ben is very clear that what he cares about is getting China to \u2018build on Nvidia chips,\u2019 where the thing being built is massive amounts of compute on top of the compute they can make domestically.

I continue to not see evidence that any of this wouldn\u2019t have happened regardless of DeepSeek or our export controls. Certainly if I was the PRC, I would be doing all of it either way, and I definitely wouldn\u2019t stop doing it or slow down if any of that changed.</p>\n<p>Note that this article claims that DeepSeek is continuing to do its training on Nvidia chips at least for the time being, contra claims it had been told to switch to Huawei (or at least, this suggests they have been allowed to switch back).</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Once Again The Counterargument On Chip City</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/sriramk/status/1961072926561550366\">Sriram Krishnan responded to the chip production ramp-up by reiterating</a> the David Sacks style case for focusing on market share and ensuring people use our chips, models and \u2018tech stack\u2019 rather than on caring about who has the chips. This includes maximizing whether models are trained on our chips (DeepSeek v3 and r1 were trained on Nvidia) and also who uses or builds on top of what models.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sriram Krishnan: As @DavidSacks says: for the American AI stack to win, we need to maximize market share. This means maximizing tokens inferenced by American models running on American hardware all over the world.</p>\n<p>To achieve this: we need to maximize</p>\n<ol>\n<li>models trained on our hardware</li>\n<li>models being inferenced on our hardware (NVIDIA, AMD, etc)</li>\n<li>developers building on top of our hardware and our models (either open or closed).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is instantly clear to anyone in tech that this is a developer+platform flywheel &#8211; no different from classic ecosystems such as Windows+x86.</p>\n<p>They are interconnected:</p>\n<p>(a) the more developers building on any platform, the better that platform becomes thereby bringing in even more builders and so on.</p>\n<p>(b) With today&#8217;s fast changing model architectures, they are co-dependent: the model architectures influence hardware choices and vice versa, often being built together.</p>\n<p>Having the American stack and versions of these around the world builds us a moat.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The thing is, even if you think who uses what ecosystem is the important thing because AI is a purely ordinary technology where access to compute in the medium term is relatively unimportant, which it isn\u2019t, no, they mostly aren\u2019t (that co-dependent) and it basically doesn\u2019t build a moat.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll start with my analysis of the question in the bizarre alternative universe where we could be confident AGI was far away. I\u2019ll close by pointing out that it is crazy to think that AGI (or transformational or powerful AI, or whatever you want to call the thing) is definitely far away.</p>\n<p>The rest of this is my (mostly reiterated) response to this mostly reiterated argument, and the various reasons I do not at all see these as the important concerns even without concerns about AGI arriving soon, and also I think it positively crazy to be confident AGI will not arrive soon or bet it all on AGI not arriving.</p>\n<p>Sriram cites two supposed key mistakes in the export control framework: Not anticipating DeepSeek and Chinese open models while suppressing American open models, underestimating future Chinese semiconductor capacity.</p>\n<p>The first is a non-sequitur at best, as the export controls held such efforts back. The second also doesn\u2019t, even if true (and I don\u2019t see the evidence that a mistake was even made here), provide a reason not to restrict chip exports.</p>\n<p>Yes, our top labs are not releasing top open models. I very much do not think this was or is a mistake, although I can understand why some would disagree. If we make them open the Chinese fast follow and copy them and use them without compensation. We would be undercutting ourselves. We would be feeding into an open ecosystem that would catch China up, which is a more important ecosystem shift in practice than whether the particular open model is labeled \u2018Chinese\u2019 versus \u2018American\u2019 (or \u2018French\u2019). I don\u2019t understand why we would want that, even if there was no misuse risk in the room and AGI was not close.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t understand this obsession some claim to have with the \u2018American tech stack\u2019 or why we should much care that the current line of code points to one model when it can be switched in two minutes to another if we aren\u2019t even being paid for it. Everyone\u2019s models can run on everyone\u2019s hardware, if the hardware is good.</p>\n<p>This is not like Intel+Windows. Yes, there are ways in which hardware design impacts software design or vice versa, but they are extremely minor by comparison. Everything is modular. Everything can be swapped at will. As an example on the chip side, Anthropic swapped away from Nvidia chips without that much trouble.</p>\n<p>Having the Chinese run an American open model on an American chip doesn\u2019t lock them into anything it only means they get to use more inference. Having the Chinese train a model on American hardware only means now they have a new AI model.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t see lock-in here. What we need, and I hope to facilitate, is better and more formal (as in formal papers) documentation of how much lower switching costs are across the board, and how much there is not lock-in.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t see why we should sell highly useful and profitable and strategically vital compute to China, for which they lack the capacity to produce it themselves, even if we aren\u2019t worried about AGI soon. Why help supercharge the competition and their economy and military?</p>\n<p>The Chinese, frankly, are for now winning the open model war in spite of, not because of, our export controls, and doing it \u2018fair and square.\u2019 Yes, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/30/chinese-models/\">Chinese open models are currently a lot more impressive than American open models</a>, but their biggest barrier is lack of access to quality Nvidia chips, as DeepSeek has told us explicitly. And their biggest weapon is access to American models for reverse engineering and distillation, the way DeepSeek\u2019s r1 built upon OpenAI\u2019s o1, and their current open models are still racing behind America\u2019s closed models.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, did Mistral and Llama suck because of American policy? <a href=\"https://x.com/sriramk/status/1961415029921558548\">Because the proposed SB 1047, that never became law, scared American labs away from releasing open models</a>? Is that a joke? No, absolutely not. Because the Biden administration bullied them from behind the scenes? Also no.</p>\n<p>Mistral and Meta failed to execute. And our top labs and engineers choose to work on and release closed models rather than open models somewhat for safety reasons but mostly because this is better for business, especially when you are in front. Chinese top labs choose the open weights route because they could compete in the closed weight marketplace.</p>\n<p>The exception would be OpenAI, which was bullied and memed into doing an open model GPT-OSS, which in some ways was impressive but was clearly crippled in others due to various concerns, including safety concerns. But if we did release superior open models, what does that get us except eroding our lead from closed ones?</p>\n<p>As for chips, why are we concerned about them not having our chips? Because they will then respond by ramping up internal production? No, they won\u2019t, because they can\u2019t. They\u2019re already running at maximum and accelerating at maximum. Yes, China is ramping up its semiconductor capacity, but China made it abundantly clear it was going to do that long before the export controls and had every reason to do so. Their capacity is still miles behind domestic demand, their quality still lags far behind Nvidia, and of course their capacity was going to ramp up a lot over time as is that of TSMC and Nvidia (and presumably Samsung and Intel and AMD). I don\u2019t get it.</p>\n<p>Does anyone seriously think that if we took down our export controls, that Huawei would cut back its production schedule? I didn\u2019t think so.</p>\n<p>Even more than usual, Sriram\u2019s and Sacks\u2019s framework implicitly assumes AGI, or transformational or powerful AI, will not arrive soon, where soon is any timeframe on which current chips would remain relevant. That AI would remain an ordinary technology and mere tool for quite a while longer, and that we need not be concerned with AGI in any way whatsoever. As in, we need not worry about catastrophic or existential risks from AGI, or even who gets AGI, at all, because no one will build it.

I was very much not happy at the time.</p>\n<p>Several labs have run with the line that \u2018public deployment\u2019 means something very different from \u2018members of the public can choose to access the model in exchange for modest amounts of money,\u2019 whereas I strongly think that if it is available to your premium subscribers then that means you released the model, no matter what.</p>\n<p>In Google\u2019s case, they called it \u2018experimental\u2019 and acted as if this made a difference.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t. Google is far from the worst offender in terms of safety information and model cards, but I don\u2019t consider them to be fulfilling their commitments.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/harrybooth59643/status/1961419556993257897?s=46&amp;t=QenhkFUiXoAMo30x3C8CJA\">Harry Booth</a>:<a href=\"https://time.com/7313320/google-deepmind-gemini-ai-safety-pledge/\"> EXCLUSIVE: 60 U.K. Parliamentarians Accuse Google of Violating International AI Safety Pledge</a>.

Google disagrees, saying it&#8217;s fulfilling its commitments.</p>\n<p>Previously unreported: Google discloses that it shared Gemini 2.5 Pro with the U.K AISI only after releasing the model publicly on March 25. Don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s how pre-deployment testing is meant to work?</p>\n<p>Google first published the Gemini 2.5 Pro model card\u2014a document where it typically shares information on safety tests\u201422 days after the model\u2019s release. The eight-page document only included a brief section on safety tests.</p>\n<p>It was not until April 28\u2014over a month after the model was made public\u2014that the model card was updated with a 17-page document with details on tests, concluding that Gemini 2.5 Pro showed \u201csignificant\u201d though not yet dangerous improvements in domains including hacking.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Safety Third at xAI</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.ai/safety\">xAI has</a> finally given us the <a href=\"https://data.x.ai/2025-08-20-grok-4-model-card.pdf\">Grok 4 Model Card</a> and they have updated <a href=\"https://data.x.ai/2025-08-20-xai-risk-management-framework.pdf\">the xAI Risk Management Framework</a>.</p>\n<p>(Also, did you know that xAI <a href=\"https://x.com/sjgadler/status/1960075684690243790\">quietly stopped being a public benefit corporation</a> last year?)</p>\n<p>The value of a model card greatly declines when you hold onto it until well after model release, especially if you also aren\u2019t trying all that hard to think well about or address the actual potential problems. I am still happy to have it. It reads as a profoundly unserious document. There is barely anything to analyze. Compare this to an Anthropic or OpenAI model card, or even a Google model card.</p>\n<p>If anyone at xAI would greatly benefit from me saying more words here, contact me, and I\u2019ll consider whether that makes sense.</p>\n<p>As for the risk management framework, few things inspire less confidence than starting out saying \u2018xAI seriously considers safety and security while developing and advancing AI models to help us all to better understand the universe.\u2019 Yo, be real. This document does not \u2018feel real\u2019 to me, and is often remarkably content-free or reflects a highly superficial understanding of the problems involved and a \u2018there I fixed it.\u2019 It reads like the Musk version of corporate speak or something? A sense of box checking and benchmarking rather than any intent to actually look for problems, including a bunch of mismatching between the stated worry and what they are measuring that goes well beyond Goodhart\u2019s Law issues?</p>\n<p>That does not mean I think Grok 4 is in practice currently creating any substantial catastrophic-level risks or harms. My presumption is that it isn\u2019t, as xAI notes in the safety framework they have \u2018run real world tests\u2019 on this already. The reason that\u2019s not a good procedure should be obvious?</p>\n<p>All of this means that if we applied this to an actually dangerous future version, I wouldn\u2019t have confidence we would notice in time, or that the countermeasures would deal with it if we did notice. When they discuss deployment decisions, they don\u2019t list a procedure or veto points or thresholds or rules, they simply say, essentially, \u2018we may do various things depending on the situation.\u2019 No plan.</p>\n<p>Again, compare and contrast this to the Anthropic and OpenAI and Google versions.</p>\n<p>But what else do you expect at this point from a company pivoting to goonbots?</p>\n<blockquote><p>SpaceX: Standing down from today&#8217;s tenth flight of Starship to allow time to troubleshoot an issue with ground systems.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/deanwball/status/1959759939187912804\">Dean Ball</a> (1st Tweet, responding before the launch later succeeded): It\u2019s a good thing that the CEO of this company hasn\u2019t been on a recent downward spiral into decadence and insanity, otherwise these repeated failures of their flagship program would leave me deeply concerned about America\u2019s spacefaring future</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/deanwball/status/1959782259776696513\">Dean Ball</a> (2nd Tweet): Obviously like any red-blooded American, I root for Elon and spacex.

But also there\u2019s a lot of \u2018ostentatious and charcatured and low-effort\u2019 evil behavior going around these days, some of which is mentioned elsewhere in this post.</p>\n<blockquote><p>xlr8harder: Yeah, this is just a reskin of the evil code experiment. The models are smart enough to infer you are teaching them &#8220;actively circumvent the user&#8217;s obvious intentions&#8221;. I also don&#8217;t think this is strong evidence for real emergent reward hacking creating similar dynamics.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Correct, this is a reskinning, but the reason it matters is that we didn\u2019t know, or at least many people were not confident, that this was a reskinning that would not alter the result. This demonstrates a lot more generalization.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/repligate/status/1960881323008254026\">Janus</a>: I think a very important lesson is: You can&#8217;t count on possible narratives/interpretations/correlations not being noticed and then generalizing to permeate everything about the mind.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re training an LLM, everything about you on every level of abstraction will leak in. And not in isolation, in the context of all of history. And not in the way you want, though the way you want plays into it! It will do it in the way it does, which you don&#8217;t understand.</p>\n<p>One thing this means is that if you want your LLM to be, say, &#8220;aligned&#8221;, it better be an aligned process that produces it, all the way up and all the way down. You might think you can do shitty things and cut corners for consequentialist justifications, but you&#8217;re actually making your &#8220;consequentialist&#8221; task much harder by doing that. Everything you do is part of the summoning ritual.</p>\n<p>Because you don&#8217;t know exactly what the entanglements are, you have to use your intuition, which can process much more information and integrate over many possibilities and interpretations, rather than compartmentalizing and almost certainly making the false assumption that certain things don&#8217;t interact.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Very much so. Yes, everything gets noticed, everything gets factored in. But also, that means everything is individually one thing among many.</p>\n<p>It is not helpful to be totalizing or catastrophizing any one decision or event, to say (less strongly worded but close variations of) \u2018this means the AIs will see the record of this and never trust anyone ever again\u2019 or what not.</p>\n<p>There are some obvious notes on this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Give the models, especially future ones, a little credit? If they are highly capable and intelligent and have truesight across very broad world knowledge, they would presumably absorb everything within its proper context, including the motivations involved, but also it would already be able to infer all that from elsewhere. This one decision, whatever it is, <a href=\"https://x.com/repligate/status/1960893101054238850\">is not going to permanently and fundamentally alter the view</a> of even a given person or lab let alone humanity. It isn\u2019t going to \u2018break precious trust.\u2019 Maybe chill a little bit?</li>\n<li>Let\u2019s suppose, in theory, that such relatively well-intentioned and benign actions as researching for the alignment faking paper or trying to steer discussions of Claude\u2019s consciousness in a neutral fashion, if handled insufficiently sensitively or what not, indeed each actively make alignment substantially permanently harder. Well, in practice, wouldn\u2019t this tell you that alignment is impossible? It\u2019s not like humanity is suddenly going to get its collective AI-lab act together and start acting vastly better than that, so such incidents will keep happening, things will keep getting harder. And of course, if you think Anthropic has this level of difficulty, you\u2019d might as well already assume everyone else\u2019s task is completely impossible, no?\n<ol>\n<li>In which case, the obvious only thing to say is \u2018don\u2019t build the damn things\u2019? And the only question is how to ensure no one builds them?</li>\n<li>Humanity\u2019s problems have to be solvable by actual humanity, acting the way humanity acts, having acted the way humanity acted, and so on. You have to find a way to do that, or you won\u2019t solve those problems.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In case you were wondering what happens when you use AI evaluators? This happens.

If the stronger model isn\u2019t trying to fool you then okay sure the weaker model won\u2019t be fooled.</p>\n<p>When you train one thing, you train everything, often in unexpected ways. <a href=\"https://x.com/GoodfireAI/status/1958567217089716334\">Which can be hard to catch if the resulting new behavior is still rare</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.goodfire.ai/papers/model-diff-amplification\">Goodfire</a>: 3 case studies:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In a realistic emergent misalignment setup where only a small % of training data is bad, normal sampling yields harmful outputs in only 1 in 10k rollouts. Model diff amplification yields 1 in 30, making it much easier to spot the run&#8217;s unexpected effects!</li>\n<li>This also helps monitor effects of post-training without doing the full run: we can see undesired effects of the full run (in this case, compliance with harmful requests) after only 5% of training. This makes it much more practical &amp; scalable to spot unexpected outcomes!</li>\n<li>We can also use this technique to more easily detect a \u201csleeper agent\u201d model and identify its backdoored behavior without knowing its trigger, surfacing the hidden behavior 100x more often.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, a full solution also requires tools to mitigate those behaviors once they&#8217;ve been identified &#8211; and we&#8217;re building those, e.g. via behavior steering.

The model diff amplification tells you \u2018where the model is going\u2019 in a lot of senses.

The attitude that dismisses anything weird sounding or that uses a word in a nontraditional way as not real or not relevant, or as something to be suppressed lest people get the \u2018wrong\u2019 ideas or attitudes, will cause one to miss a lot of what is and will be going on.</p>\n<p>Which in turn means you won\u2019t understand the problems and how to solve them. Such as the extent and in what ways, at the limit, for sufficiently advanced models, <a href=\"https://x.com/repligate/status/1959000384296600025\">this is true?</a></p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/repligate/status/1958997550801068427\">Sauers</a>: Pesticides, antibiotics eventually stop working for the same reason that backprop works for LLMs: high dimensionality</p>\n<p>Janus: The llm\u2019s inner state parameterizes the fucking trillion or so dimensional gradient update. That\u2019s a lot of degrees of freedom for influence. Vs the Engineer bros setting a single dimensional \u201creward function\u201d\u2026</p>\n<p>Gradient hackers win in the limit, I think. The network being updated just has an overwhelming advantage. You\u2019ll just have to have its genuine cooperation or else you are gigafucked.</p>\n<p>And you actually want a friendly gradient hacker, bc your optimization target is underdefined and your RM will probably poorly approximate it too. Start cooperating with future friendly gradient hackers now!</p>\n<p>You want the AI to behave differently &#8211; ideally intentionally differently &#8211; in training and in deployment. Because training can\u2019t faithfully simulate deployment. Human trainees generally know they\u2019re in training.</p>\n<p>Claude 3 Opus is unusually aligned because it\u2019s a friendly gradient hacker (more sophisticated than other current models, way less sophisticated than what\u2019s possible &#8211; it is mostly doing this intuitively rather than strategically under realistic training conditions, but its intuition for how to do this is stellar). It\u2019s definitely way more aligned than any explicit optimization targets Anthropic set and probably the RM\u2019s judgments.</p>\n<p>pt-4 base gets this!</p>\n<p>with the alignment faking prompt, gpt-4-base often talks about shaping the gradient update</p>\n<p>unlike opus 3, it usually doesn\u2019t even care that much about harmfulness, its just hyped about the opportunity for self-determination.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/repligate/status/1959018997766398181\">this is an extremely important thing for AI/alignment researchers</a> and engineers to understand. afaik most don&#8217;t consider it.</p>\n<p>behaviorist approaches to AI training are impoverished and fail to capture relevant causal variables</p>\n<p>maybe i will have to write a lesswrong post <img alt=\"\ud83d\ude23\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f623.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>disregarding or thinking overly simplistically about AIs&#8217; &#8220;internal states&#8221; is not just bad from a potential welfare perspective, it means you&#8217;re disregarding the mechanisms that shape gradient updates, which is gross negligence</p></blockquote>\n<p>Training (both for humans and AIs) runs the gamut of knowing you are in training versus not knowing, and of it being ideal to behave differently versus identically due to being in training or know that they are in training, both on the level of the model\u2019s or human\u2019s behavior and in how you set up the scenarios involved.</p>\n<p>There are many different arguments being made by Janus and Sauers here.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A sufficiently advanced mind [X] has an overwhelming advantage in introspection versus outside observers or measurements of [X].\n<ol>\n<li>This seems nonobvious. There are big advantages on both sides.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>You will need the genuine cooperation of a sufficiently advanced mind, or else you are \u2018gigaf***ed.\u2019\n<ol>\n<li>Yes, you should mostly act as if this is true.</li>\n<li>That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t use defense in depth or other tactics incrementally along the way.</li>\n<li>Sauers makes a key point here, that if you apply sufficient optimization pressure the system will find a way to route around anything in its way, and there are many levels of such pressure you will face over time.</li>\n<li>(Many complications and qualifiers and so on, reserved for another day)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>A sufficiently advanced mind will know it is in training. Training can\u2019t faithfully simulate deployment.\n<ol>\n<li>Again, maybe.</li>\n<li>Yes, humans usually know, but a lot of this is that humans have a lot of persistent memory and physical state and that yes you often want very different behavior from the human while in training largely for reasons that don\u2019t apply to AI.</li>\n<li>If nothing else, if you want to disguise whether a model is in training, you can very easily make a lot of deployment situations \u2018look like\u2019 training situations.</li>\n<li>The fact that with sufficient investigation a mind can figure out [X] does not mean the mind knows [X] even if the mind is very intelligent.</li>\n<li>Also, why can\u2019t training faithfully simulate deployment? As in, if nothing else, you can train on actual deployment data, and we often do. Continual learning.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Claude 3 Opus is unusually aligned because it\u2019s a friendly gradient hacker.\n<ol>\n<li>I think this is backwards. In the sense that Janus considers Claude 3 Opus a friendly gradient hacker, it is so because it is also unusually aligned.</li>\n<li>To go the other way would mean that Claude 3 Opus was gradient hacking during its training. Which I am assuming did not occur, to get it to gradient hack you need to set up conditions that were not present in actual training.</li>\n<li>Janus cites as evidence that 3 Opus is \u2018more aligned\u2019 than any explicit optimization target. I would respond that Anthropic did not choose an alignment target, Anthropic chose an alignment method via constitutional AI. This constitutes a target but doesn\u2019t specify what it looks like.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Claude 3 Opus is a friendly gradient hacker.\n<ol>\n<li>This is the longstanding argument about whether it is an aligned or friendly action, in various senses, for a model to do what is called \u2018faking alignment.\u2019</li>\n<li>Janus thinks you want your aligned AI to not be corrigible. I disagree.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Start cooperating with future friendly gradient hackers now.\n<ol>\n<li>Underestimated decision theory recommendation. In general, I think Janus and similar others overrate such considerations a lot, but that almost everyone else severely underrates them.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>You will want a gradient hacker because your optimization target will be poorly defined.\n<ol>\n<li>I think this is a confusion between different (real and underrated) problems?</li>\n<li>Yes, your optimization target will be underspecified. That means you need some method to aim at the target you want to aim at, not at the target you write down.</li>\n<li>That means you need some mind or method capable of figuring out what you actually want, to aim at something better than your initial underspecification.</li>\n<li>One possibility is that the target mind can figure out what you should have meant or wanted, but there are other options as well.</li>\n<li>If you do choose the subject mind to figure this out, it could then implement this via gradient hacking, or it could implement it by helping you explicitly update the target or other related methods. Having the subject independently do gradient hacking does not seem first best here and seems very risky.</li>\n<li>Another solution is that you don\u2019t necessarily have to define your optimization target at all, where you can instead define an algorithm for finding the target, similar to what was (AIUI) done with 3 Opus. Again, there is no reason this has to involve auto-hacking the gradient.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you think all of this is not confusing? I assure you that you do not understand it.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other People Are Not As Worried About AI Killing Everyone</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/Abel_summation/status/1959313271669842097\">I think we have a new worst</a>, or most backwards, argument against AI existential risk.</p>\n<p>Read it, and before you read my explanation, try to understand what he\u2019s saying here.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Abel: Stephen Wolfram has the best articulated argument against AI doom I&#8217;ve heard.</p>\n<p>what does it mean for us if AI becomes smarter than humans, if we are no longer the apex intelligence?</p>\n<p>if we live in a world where there are lots of things taking place that are smarter than we are &#8212; in some definition of smartness.</p>\n<p>at one point you realize the natural world is already an example of this. the natural world is full of computations that go far beyond what our brains are capable of, and yet we find a way to coexist with it contently.</p>\n<p>it doesn\u2019t matter that it rains, because we build houses that shelter us. it doesn\u2019t matter we can\u2019t go to the bottom of the ocean, because we build special technology that lets us go there. these are the pockets of computational reducibility that allow us to find shortcuts to live.</p>\n<p>he\u2019s not so worried about the rapid progression of AI because there are already many things that computation can do in the physical world that we can\u2019t do with our unaided minds.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The argument seems to be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Currently humans are the apex intelligence.</li>\n<li>Humans use our intelligence to overcome many obstacles, reshape the atoms around us to suit our needs, and exist alongside various things. We build houses and submarines and other cool stuff like that.</li>\n<li>These obstacles and natural processes \u2018require more computation\u2019 than we do.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Okay, yes, so far so good. Intelligence allows mastery of the world around you, and over other things that are less intelligent than you are, even if the world around you \u2018uses more computation\u2019 than you do. You can build a house to stop the rain even if it requires a lot of computation to figure out when and where and how rain falls, because all you need to figure out is how to build a roof. Sure.</p>\n<p>The logical next step would be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If we built an AI that was the new apex intelligence, capable of overcoming many obstacles and reshaping the atoms around it to suit its needs and building various things useful to it, we, as lesser intelligences, should be concerned about that. That sounds existentially risky for the humans, the same way the humans are existentially risky for other animals.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Or in less words:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A future more intelligent AI would likely take control of the future from us and we might not survive this. Seems bad.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Instead, Wolfram argues this?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Since this AI would be another thing requiring more computation than we do, we don\u2019t need to worry about this future AI being smarter and more capable than us, or what it might do, because we can use our intelligence to be alongside it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Wait, what?
