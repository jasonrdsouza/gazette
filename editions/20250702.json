They're both simple and incredibly useful, so let's do that this week! </p> <h3>Sets and quantifiers</h3> <p>A <strong>set</strong> is a collection of unordered, unique elements. <code>{1, 2, 3, \u2026}</code> is a set, as are \"every programming language\", \"every programming language's Wikipedia page\", and \"every function ever defined in any programming language's standard library\". You can put whatever you want in a set, with some very specific limitations to avoid certain paradoxes.<sup id=\"fnref:paradox\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/rss#fn:paradox\">2</a></sup> </p> <p>Once we have a set, we can ask \"is something true for all elements of the set\" and \"is something true for at least one element of the set?\" IE, is it true that every programming language has a <code>set</code> collection type in the core language? We would write it like this:</p> <div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code># all of them all l in ProgrammingLanguages: HasSetType(l) # at least one some l in ProgrammingLanguages: HasSetType(l) </code></pre></div> <p>This is the notation I use in the book because it's easy to read, type, and search for.

I had heard nothing of its development even though I was working on <a href=\"https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder\">Cinder</a> at the time and generally heard about new JIT efforts. I started poking at it.</p> <p>The README has some excellent structural explanation of how they optimize Python, including a nice introduction to hidden classes (also called shapes, layouts, and maps elsewhere). Hidden classes are core to making dynamic language runtimes fast: they allow for what is normally a hashtable lookup to become an integer comparison and a memory load. They rely on <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/800017.800542\">the assumption</a> that even in a dynamic language, programmers are not very creative, and therefore for a given location in the code (PC), the number of types seen will be 1 or small. See a <a href=\"https://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-simple-object-model.html\">great tutorial</a> by CF Bolz-Tereick on how to build a hidden class based object model.</p> <p>Hidden classes give you the ability to more quickly read from objects, but you, the runtime implementor, have to decide what kind of cache you want to use. Should you have a monomorphic cache? Or a polymorphic cache?</p> <h2 id=\"inline-caching-and-specialization\">Inline caching",
