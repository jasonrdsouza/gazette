I&#8217;m the person who coined and first published this term. I&#8217;ve been studying this phenomenon for the past four years, so forgive the rather long comment! A quick factual clarification: the Vibecession began in 2022 as the sentiment&#8211;data divergence that opened up that summer is the real starting point. The decade before didn&#8217;t have the same shape of malaise, which you can see in the sentiment data you included. People who&#8217;ve also been working on this topic tend to focus on the same pressures you outlined like housing, education, measurement problems which are absolutely part of the story. Maybe this is what you meant by smoking gun, but the Vibecession has crossed into somewhat of a meaning-making crisis which shows up in collapsing trust and inconsistent reactions to the data. Every generation has one of these, but ours is flattened across all ages due to social media and those tighter economic constraints. Expectations around future stability collapsed at the same time institutions lost credibility, and that combination changes how people interpret even good data. Also the post-2020 political environment runs on performance and constant identity signaling, and economic sentiment gets lost in those dynamics, which is why the usual models don&#8217;t fully explain what&#8217;s going on. Finally, we really aren&#8217;t in one right now, as the economic data has deteriorated meaningfully and the negative sentiment is warranted at this point.</p></blockquote><p>I appreciate this guide to the original intent of the word, but I claim &#8216;death of the author&#8217; - it seems to me this is more than just a two-year problem. I remember people complaining about hellworld, the broken social contract, the Boomers tearing up the bridge behind them, vanishing opportunities for the young, the blackpill of modern life, etc, well before 2022. Memory can be faulty, but don&#8217;t we need something like this to explain the Trump campaign, the Sanders campaign, Chapo Trap House, Red Scare, 4chan, and all the other mid-2010s politicians and media telling us that things were worse than they&#8217;d ever been and outrage was the only acceptable response?</p><p>And I appreciate that the economic data have gotten worse so that some level of worry is now justified. But GDP growth last quarter was 4.3% (without AI it would still have been like 4%). And I still hear people they&#8217;ll never be able to have a family but it doesn&#8217;t matter because it would be immoral to bring children into a world where they could never have any chance of getting ahead or living a normal life. Even if we&#8217;re in a mild recession now, that doesn&#8217;t sound like mild recession talk!</p><p>Still, Kyla has spiritual copyright on vibecession, so maybe we need another phrase to discuss the longer-term hypothesis. I propose &#8220;The Great Vibepression&#8221;.</p><p><strong>TTAR <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/vibecession-much-more-than-you-wanted/comment/184399006\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I was a doomer when I graduated in 2014 because that&#8217;s what my parents and literally every single media outlet and professor were preaching to me, then I got a job right out of a college with a mediocre (3.6) GPA from a state school and went to work as an analyst at a midsized regional bank, got promoted internally a few times and lived very frugally with my wife (met at work), now I&#8217;m able to be a stay at home dad with our kid while she works from home. We live in Oklahoma; we bought new construction last year for $200k with some spare cash I had laying around in a brokerage account. So I am pretty fully cured of the doomerism, success is trivial. My bosses and coworkers constantly praised the fact that I approached my job with gratitude and focused on identifying the goals and achieving them efficiently and optimally from 9-5 every day. That&#8217;s it. No late hours, no connections or networking or anything else fancy.</p></blockquote><p>Good for TTAR, but I&#8217;m including this one here as confirmation that people graduating in 2014 felt like &#8220;my parents and literally every single media outlet and professor&#8221; were preaching doom at them.</p><p><strong>Moose <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/vibecession-much-more-than-you-wanted/comment/184275877\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Every explanation for the vibecession that does not attempt to explain why there is a huge drop in 2021 specifically and persistently lower vibes for the following years should be disregarded. I think the best explanation is just inflation: this is what is most different in 2021-2024 compared to previous time periods, but you can also blame the shift to remote work, or higher housing prices. Examples of bad explanations would be &#8220;phones bad&#8221;, &#8220;media bad&#8221;, or &#8220;inequality bad&#8221; without explaining why they became worse in 2021.</p></blockquote><p>I agree that if you follow the consumer confidence numbers and date it to 2021-2022, inflation is an easy culprit and we don&#8217;t need to look for anything more. My theory predicts that some kind of vibecession will continue even when inflation is far in the past.</p><p><strong>Zahmakibo writes:</strong></p><blockquote><p><em>&gt; &#8220;There is one anomaly, which is that I remember people complaining about the bad economy and the Boomers and hellworld since well before 2020 (consider the Trump and Sanders campaigns), but the official vibes didn&#8217;t crash until COVID.

That must have been a bitter pill to a lot of budding socialists.

My go-to illustration is the first verse of the theme song for Friends, which started airing in 1994:</p><p>&#8220;So no one told you life was gonna be this way / Your job&#8217;s a joke, you&#8217;re broke, your love life&#8217;s D.O.A., / It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re always stuck in second gear / When it hasn&#8217;t been your day, your week / Your month, or even your year&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;m younger than Erica, and have less pop culture literacy: can someone tell me whether the Friends theme song was meant to express a <em>zeitgeist </em>that would be immediately recognizable by and sympathetic to most viewers, or whether we were supposed to interpret it as referring to a few especially unlucky people?</p><p></p><h2>2: Is The Vibecession Just Sublimating Cultural Complaints?</h2><p></p><p><strong>Tanya Jarvik <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/vibecession-much-more-than-you-wanted/comment/184246521\">writes</a></strong>:</p><blockquote><p>Maybe people are complaining about not having enough money these days because the amount of money it takes to produce a feeling of abundance is larger in the absence of community, sense of purpose, &#8220;my life matters&#8221; etc.</p></blockquote><p>The two most certain things in the world are that people will suspect every social complaint of being a proxy for economic problems, and that people will suspect every economic complaint of being a proxy for social problems.</p><p>The strongest argument against this position is that the vibecession started sometime between 2008 and 2023, and I don&#8217;t think this was an especially bad time for community and purpose compared to any other time since the 60s. I don&#8217;t think earlier periods of social dissolution were sublimated into economic complaints.</p><p><strong>Alex Zavoluk <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/vibecession-much-more-than-you-wanted/comment/184600156\">comes down in favor</a></strong>:</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Players are great at identifying problems but terrible at coming up with solutions.&#8221;</em> This is from Mark Rosewater, the head designer of Magic: the Gathering. His point is that when playing a game, it&#8217;s easy to tell that you aren&#8217;t having fun, but not always so easy to know exactly why or how to fix it. And in my experience, it&#8217;s very true--people will repeat platitudes they&#8217;ve heard from others about what makes a game fun or not fun, but the complaint manifestly does not apply to the situation they&#8217;re describing. Or there&#8217;s another situation which totally resolves the complaint but they&#8217;re still not having fun.</p><p>I think the same principle applies more generally. People are unhappy, and they can easily determine that. But that doesn&#8217;t mean they know what would change that fact. Money and material standard of living are easy to point to as things that would make life better, but my understanding of the research is that how much happier people think they will be after making more money is higher than how much happier they actually become. People in their 20s are now Gen Z, i.e. people who were raised after several generations of an increasing trend to shelter children and prevent them from having any independence, and who have been exposed to a constant stream of social media since middle school. One can debate whether these really are the problem, but I certainly wouldn&#8217;t <em>expect</em> zoomers to say, &#8220;oh yeah, obviously I&#8217;m unhappy because I was protected from challenge as a child, had to be driven everywhere, was never allowed to practice being independent until after college, community life has been severely hampered, and I&#8217;ve been exposed to brain-rotting forms of media since I was old enough to read, in total contrast to my parents and every previous generation&#8221; even if that&#8217;s true.</p></blockquote><p>Alex also mentions the political angle:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YAm7!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8e0184e-12e8-4066-9769-b5280224abba_1156x990.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"CDN media\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"438.47750865051904\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YAm7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8e0184e-12e8-4066-9769-b5280224abba_1156x990.jpeg\" title=\"CDN media\" width=\"512\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Obviously nothing real changes the exact second a new president is inaugurated, so people must be using questions about the economy to express their overall happiness about the state of the world. </p><p>Alex asks whether increasing political polarization could make this worse.

Correct half a dozen things like this, and the real poverty line is probably somewhere between $35K - $60K. The percent of Americans below this line continues to decline every year, as it has for decades.  Green finally pseudo-apologized, lambasting the &#8220;mockery machine&#8221; of the &#8220;cognitive elite&#8221; but admitting that his post &#8220;was never intended to go viral and was written for my existing audience that tends to be pretty understanding that I don&#8217;t do this for a living, but rather as PART of my living&#8221;</p><p>Still, many people took Green&#8217;s article as a starting point to contribute to the Vibecession discourse, so let&#8217;s go over the ones that touch on our topic in more detail.</p><p><strong>Lincicome </strong>titles his response <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/commentary/140000-poverty-line-laughably-wrong-so-why-does-it-feel-right\">The $140,000 Poverty Line Is Wrong, So Why Does It Feel Right?</a>, and blames <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol_effect\">Baumol&#8217;s cost disease</a>:</p><blockquote><p>As the <em>Financial Times&#8217;</em> John-Burns Murdoch just <a href=\"https://url.avanan.click/v2/r01/___https:/l.thedispatch.com/z/c/27175/262290ac0f1442a49467b12f3ab5a464/cdb7a30f643a488da1da63980386fe1a___.YXAzOmNhdG9pbnN0aXR1dGU6YTpvOmQxZGYwOWYwYTEwY2MyZDc2MWZmMjhiYWVmZGFlMzFmOjc6NmY4MjpiZmVmODY2ZGI3YTAzNzliOTk1MmEyN2ZlYTU1ZTI5ODQ2YjI3OTI1NTA4ZjJiMTMyOTNiMzI4OWI3YmRmNGY1Omg6VDpO\">detailed</a>, Americans&#8217; overall cost of living has improved over time, but certain highly visible and socially desirable services have become more expensive. That&#8217;s not a conspiracy against the middle class but instead just Baumol at work:</p><p><em>&#8220;[A]s countries develop economically, the same productivity growth that drives down the cost of tradeable goods causes the cost of in-person services to balloon. Wages in sectors like healthcare and education that require intensive face-to-face labour, and have slow (if any) productivity growth, are forced upwards in order to attract workers who would otherwise opt for high-paying work in more productive sectors. The result is that even if people keep consuming the exact same basket of goods and services, as living standards in their country increase they will find more and more of their spending is going on essential services.&#8221;</em></p><p>Sectors where productivity grows slowly and prices outpace inflation&#8212;health care, education, child care, personal services, housing (construction), etc.&#8212;happen to be the same ones that middle-class families notice most and that signal social status. As we&#8217;ve all gotten richer, moreover, these services have transitioned from luxuries to expectations.

It would just feel like a failure, because we don&#8217;t realize how much worse than 1950s lifestyle was compared to our current conditions. </p><p>The article&#8217;s paywalled, but you can get a pretty good sense of the argument from these paragraphs. After determining that the median man makes about $80,000/year, he writes:</p><blockquote><p>Let&#8217;s say our $80,000-a-year man is living in the Jacksonville area. The Department of Housing and Urban Development calculates what are called Fair Market Rents for each American metro &#8212; this means the 40th percentile rent for a home with any given set of characteristics. <a href=\"https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr/fmr2025/FY2025_FMR_Schedule.pdf\">They say</a> F.M.R. for a three-bedroom home in the Jacksonville area is $2,163. That comes out to about 30 percent of Mr. Median&#8217;s annual income.</p><p>Can you really get a place to live for that little? Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://www.trulia.com/home/12555-belmont-lakes-dr-jacksonville-fl-32225-58545533\">lovely three-bedroom home in the East Arlington neighborhood for $2,020 a month</a>, and it&#8217;s zoned for an elementary school with a 10-out-of-10 ranking from GreatSchools.</p><p>It&#8217;s true that 1,617 square feet is on the small side for, say, a family of five in the contemporary United States. But the <a href=\"https://www.newser.com/story/225645/average-size-of-us-homes-decade-by-decade.html\">average size of a new single family home was 1,289 square feet in 1960 and 1,500 square feet in 1970</a>. Two of your kids are going to need to share a bedroom, but that&#8217;s how people lived back in the day.</p><p>There&#8217;s more to life than housing, of course, but I started there because that&#8217;s the largest item in a household budget. Durable goods like furniture, cars, and appliances have all become better and more affordable since the mid-1960s. That&#8217;s partially offset by rising prices for things like college tuition, child care, and health care. But in the 1960s, most young people didn&#8217;t go to college. The way health insurance works, you only need one worker in your family to get a job-based health plan. And of course, with your wife serving as a full-time homemaker, you don&#8217;t need to worry about child care expenses.</p><p>The big thing is that, with a larger family, you literally have a bunch of mouths to feed. But the model here is to replicate <a href=\"https://ers.usda.gov/data-products/charts-of-note/chart-detail?chartId=100002\">how people actually lived in the mid-1960s</a>, which is that they <a href=\"https://ms32-23594.medium.com/the-cultural-revolution-of-eating-out-b3f5b03d6516\">dined out much less frequently</a> and also spent a much larger share of their total income on food.</p></blockquote><p>When I try to retrace this, it seems possible, but barely. I imagined doing this in Sacramento, to be near family. Suppose I make $80K pretax = $6.6K/month pretax = $5K per month posttax. A cheap 3-bedroom house on a nice-enough block is $2200 mortgage, assume $3K after property taxes etc. A cheap <em>new</em> car is $350/month. Food can be arbitrarily low if you&#8217;re willing to eat rice all the time, but let&#8217;s say $250/month. CoveredCalifornia offered my family of four healthcare for $600/month. So top four expenses take $4200/month of the $5000/month pretax income. I don&#8217;t know; seems tough. I would like to see a more thorough breakdown of an average 2026 vs. 1956 man&#8217;s likely budget. </p><p>There are also some areas where it&#8217;s harder to separate genuine declines from rising expectations. Most people in the 1950s didn&#8217;t have health insurance. Was that because they accepted lower levels of health, or because medical care was cheaper, and easy enough to afford out-of-pocket? Probably some very complicated combination of both. And it might be impossible to get certain kinds of 1950s medical care today, i.e. a bed in a cheap low-quality shared hospital room.</p><p>(some of the best discussion around this came from the response to Elizabeth Warren&#8217;s <em>The Two-Income Trap</em>, <a href=\"https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2019/05/06/the-two-income-trap-stuff-is-clearly-incorrect/\">see eg Matt Bruenig here</a>)</p><p>Still, I find this tangential to the main point. Yes, a few conservatives complain that it&#8217;s hard to have a single-income family. But most vibecession complaints come from singles or dual-earner households!</p><p></p><h2>4: What About Other Countries?</h2><p>&#8230;</p><p><strong>Dionysus <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/vibecession-much-more-than-you-wanted/comment/184606939\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Did you know that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/business/china-young-people-boom.html\">China also has a vibecession?</a></p><p>If even China can&#8217;t regulate social media heavily enough to prevent this phenomenon, how can any liberal society possibly hope to?</p></blockquote><p>The link goes to an NYT article, which includes quotes like:</p><blockquote><p>Using apps like RedNote and Douyin, people are reviving memories of the 2000s and the early 2010s with photos of daring outfits, upbeat songs and vintage TV commercials, all of which, in different ways, evoke a time in China that pulsed with optimism. &#8220;The music back then throbbed with exuberance, brimming with the sense that the future could only get brighter,&#8221; a middle-aged man said in a RedNote video. &#8220;Today&#8217;s lyrics begin with lines like, &#8216;We&#8217;re trying our best to survive.&#8217;&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>And</p><blockquote><p>The boom-time beauty meme is the latest expression of a Gen Z counterculture born of disillusionment, the recognition that they may be the first generation in half a century unlikely to surpass their parents&#8217; standard of living, no matter how hard they try. </p><p>Over the past five years, this quiet resistance has taken many forms.

My main guesses would be:</p><ul><li><p>Right-wing parties control a supermajority of TV and print media. They have also been in the govt most of the time, which means they control the state TV and have an interest in presenting things as rosey. The much older population makes the internet less relevant for public sentiment. Even in the few years where they were at the opposition, they mostly focused on immigration and crime to rile up popular sentiment, I guess because the population is older, their voters even moreso, so they care more about that than about the economy</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The absolutely massive and unsustainable intergenerational transfers keep everyone somehow sedated. Maybe your wage is terrible, especially after taxes, maybe you&#8217;re unemployed and it&#8217;s hard to find a job, but grandma will be happy to help out her only grandchild.

The stereotypical rich-kid private uni is, even as a proportion of median income, still <em>a lot</em> cheaper than an Ivy and probably even an unremarkable liberal arts school. Unless you want to study business or law, there just aren&#8217;t private unis (there is one for medicine but it&#8217;s universally considered bad). Public uni is cheap and usually open access. If there is some kind of selection (eg medicine or architecture), it&#8217;s a standardized test, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about optimizing your kid&#8217;s extracurriculars, you can just have them do what they like or what is important to you. You don&#8217;t have to worry about living in a good school district because anyone can enroll in any public HS, and with very few exceptions private HSs are worse. If you are more aware about the state of the country than most of your co-nationals, and want to send your kid to study abroad, any other EU country is bound by treaty to treat them exactly like their own citizens, you just have to make sure they speak decent (not excellent, decent) English. The anxiety Americans have about setting up their kids for success is assuaged, partly because Italians are less ambitious but mostly because it&#8217;s objectively much easier to do so.</p></li><li><p>Related to the above point, but the EU ensures that in the worst countries there is a lot of evaporative cooling. The most ambitious Italians are not doomscrolling about how terrible the tech job market is in Italy, they&#8217;re learning German or looking for a job in the Netherlands. And when they&#8217;re there they complain even less than the locals because well, nobody likes an ungrateful guest, they don&#8217;t want to feel they uprooted their life for nothing, and it&#8217;s still much better than Italy - the usual reasons immigrants are much more appreciative than natives everywhere.</p></li></ul><p>The last point obviously does not apply to the richest countries themselves (hence why populism in the Nordics, Germany and the Netherlands looks more like MAGA than the rest of the European right), but the first three do, <em>mutatis mutandis</em>. The second and the third one even moreso, opportunities are as equal as they can realistically be and the safety net really robust. Nobody is afraid they will end up destitute, and opportunities are as equalized as they can realistically be across the bottom 95% (maybe even 99%) of the kids. Once you take away those two sources of anxiety, people tend to be a lot more relaxed.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Citizen Penrose <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/vibecession-much-more-than-you-wanted/comment/184294564\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>On the Brooklyn theory.

Like you said, if inflation has historically actually been much higher it provides a very parsimonious explanation for all the other data.</p><p>CPI might do a good job measuring short term changes in inflation, say year to year, but it&#8217;s very unclear that it can be used to make long term comparisons between different decades, as all figures in this post implicitly do.</p><p>I liked this post a lot about ways CPI figures can be systemically wrong stretched over time:</p><p><a href=\"https://devinhelton.com/economics/gdp-and-cpi-are-broken\">https://devinhelton.com/economics/gdp-and-cpi-are-broken</a></p><p>The metric which that post suggests as a more realistic measure of real incomes is how many hours of median wages are required for a 30 year old man to provide: A running car. A house. 2k calories of food daily.</p><p>I asked chat gpt&#8217;s deep research to calculate an index for that basket of goods and the index has been on a secular decline since around 1970, and in 2025 was only about half the 1970 value (i.e. it takes twice as many working hours to provide those goods now.) <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/6931e385-c8b8-800f-922f-cf2202485000\">https://chatgpt.com/share/6931e385-c8b8-800f-922f-cf2202485000</a></p><p>Also even if the CPI figures are right, the composition might still matter. Broadly, essential goods are more expensive now than in 1970 and consumer goods are much cheaper. Even if that looks like a wash in CPI figure it could still mean a loss in wellbeing for several reasons:</p><p>1.) Maybe consumer goods are more likely to be affected by hedonic adaptation or have negative externalities. By normal CPI measures a smartphone might be worth a million dollars in 1970, but what is the actual hedonic effect of smartphones? (maybe negative?) Having a &#8220;one million dollar&#8221; smartphone isn&#8217;t going to make up for not having a &#163;300k house.</p><p>2.) Maybe consumer goods have steeper diminishing marginal utility. The same way having three right shoes isn&#8217;t better than one right and one left shoe, being able to afford twenty 50&#8221; tvs isn&#8217;t as good as being able to afford one tv + a house to put it in.</p></blockquote><p>I appreciate your work, but when I try to check ChatGPT&#8217;s work, I find that its &#8220;basket of goods&#8221; assumes the median person buys one house per year. This means the basket massively overweights the price of housing compared to everything else, and - since the price of housing has increased the most - it massively overestimates inflation.</p><p><strong>WoolyAI writes:</strong></p><blockquote><p>For the first time, this is less than I wanted to know, very specifically regarding inflation measurements and how we adjust for it in wages.</p><p>Specifically, I can remember around 2013 when there was a proposal that Social Security COLA adjustments (annual cost of living increases) be tied to Chained CPI, rather than CPI. And the AARP seemed very, very convinced that minor changes to how inflation was calculated would dramatically impact real people&#8217;s Social Security checks (1). I&#8217;ve seen calculations that chained CPI is 0.25-0.3% (5) lower than CPI. Which is small overall but large relative to overall inflation, roughly 2%, and compounding.</p><p>I don&#8217;t want to argue here that the goldbugs are right and the purchasing power of the US dollar has dropped by 80%. But it does seem plausible that different inflation measures, even if both equally valid, could dramatically alter the real median wage over this period.</p><p>For example, from FRED&#8217;s &#8220;Real Median Household Income&#8221; series (2), from 2000-2024, income grew from $71,790 to $83,730. That&#8217;s about a 16.6% increase over 24 years. That&#8217;s roughly a 0.6% annual growth rate. If the difference between Chained CPI and CPI is roughly 0.3%/year and real median income growth is ~0.6%/year, then how we measure inflation has a pretty significant impact on how we calculate real income, as well as every inflation adjusted measure we looked at.</p><p>And I&#8217;m pretty confident that chained CPI is valid, because in the &#8220;Real Median Household Income&#8221; data from FRED, under notes, it says &#8220;Income in 2024 C-CPI-U (2000-2024) and R-CPI-U-RS (pre-2000) adjusted dollars.&#8221; Which looks like the pre-2000 numbers are calculated using traditional CPI and the post-2000 numbers are calculated using chained CPI. This is buttressed by the fact that FRED&#8217;s chained CPI data only goes back to 2000 (3)</p><p>So, briefly, I don&#8217;t like the &#8220;Miscalculation Of Inflation&#8221; section and I wish it dove into more detail because:</p><p>#1 There are multiple valid inflation metrics. I have nothing against CPI, it&#8217;s a solid metric and we have the data going back to the 60&#8217;s, and I have nothing against chained CPI, which is the current standard FRED uses and also makes more sense (4). However, there are more inflation metrics beyond Chained CPI; Penn State lists 5 here alone (6)</p><p>#2 The impact of different inflation metrics is large enough to significantly alter the increase in real median wages, say up or down 50%.</p><p>#3 I don&#8217;t understand how the decision to use different inflation measures affects all our other inflation adjusted metrics. To make this specific, I don&#8217;t know what the real median household income would be for 2019 if we calculated it with CPI (the way we did in 1999) vs with chained CPI.</p><p>#4 The response from economists here feels&#8230;dismissive. Which would be fine if there really was a single consistent inflation metric everyone was confident in, and maybe there is, but there seems to be a lot more complexity and value judgment to inflation metrics than &#8220;just CPI&#8221;. Especially when there&#8217;s such a gap between consumer sentiment/vibes and official statistics which would be significantly impacted by different inflation measures.</p><p>#5 Which is worse, because&#8230;I cannot help but note that the kind of guys who post things like the &#8220;US Wages in Gold&#8221; or &#8220;The Fiat Crisis&#8221; (7) are disproportionately multimillionaire crypto bros who&#8230;On the one hand they all sounds like salesmen at best and scammers at worst and constantly predict a US fiscal and monetary collapse but&#8230;they did go act on those beliefs and built the entire crypto ecosystem worth at least half a trillion. Anyone who&#8217;s financial/economic philosophy directly leads to them inventing their own ridiculously lucrative alternative financial system deserves to be taken at least somewhat seriously.</p><p>To clarify, I don&#8217;t think the impacts of different inflation measures are large enough for a decline narrative but they could be for a stagnation narrative.</p><p>Real Income growth of 16% from 2000-2024 sounds like slow, solid but uninteresting growth. 6-7% total growth over that same period &#8220;feels&#8221; like stagnation.</p><p>Inflation-adjusted rents going up 40% vs 30%.</p><p>An average mortgage payment of $3.3k vs $3k compared to an average mortgage payment of $2k in 2000.</p><p>I would appreciate any insight anyone else has, as this is a subject I know worse than nothing about, I know a little.

Money is tight. Meat is a luxury. Your husband beats you on occasion, and no one cares.</p><p>That was the reality for my grandparents. Yes, my grandfather owned the business, but it was a really hard life by modern standards. Obviously living standards were rising rapidly which is not the case today, but none of the people complaining about how hard things are now would trade places to take on that life.</p></blockquote><p>I like this comment for putting the &#8220;your life really is different from and better than past generations&#8217; in ways that are invisible to you&#8221; argument in stark relief.

My grandfather rarely saw his kids. He never made it to a single baseball game or activity. I have worked enough customer service jobs to know how utterly draining they are, and I've known enough people who owned their own business to know how brutal that can be.

This demonstrates that vibes can be totally divorced from the real economic situation, and makes me less neurotic about searching for some way that the US vibes could be correct. </p><p>My second strongest update comes from Alex&#8217;s chart showing wild swings in partisan ratings of economic health when a president from a different party gets elected, which again show vibes totally divorced from reality.</p><p>The strongest counterargument is that the housing (not rent) situation has genuinely been awful since about 2020. If you want to argue that the bad vibes began then, and are entirely about not-yet-homeowners despairing at their chances of ever owning a home, then those bad vibes would be fully justified.</p><p>I&#8217;m also more open to taking the consumer confidence charts seriously, limiting the vibecession proper to ~2022 - 2024, and saying it was mostly about inflation, plus a side of high housing prices. All of the pessimism before 2022 was something else, mostly coming from a few disenfranchised or chronically pessimistic groups and not having as much to do with the economy in particular.</p><p>I would like to see someone seriously investigate an average 1955 couple&#8217;s budget vs. an average modern couple&#8217;s budget, discuss how far each one would go, and do a more careful analysis of who was getting the better deal, and by how much.</p>"

Because why not?</p>\n<p>The progress has simultaneously been mind bogglingly impressive and fast. But a lot of people don\u2019t see it that way, because progress has been incremental, and because we were reasonably expecting to often get even more than this.</p>\n<div>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-24996\"></span>\n\n\n</div>\n<p>The public conversation and debate, even more than before, was full of false narratives and active attempts to make the situation worse. The same goes for attempts to shape Federal policy towards AI, and OpenAI\u2019s conversion into a for-profit.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been, as they say, one battle after another, with many wins, many setbacks and a lot of things in between.</p>\n<p>This includes the key developments in AI, and also other blog posts from the year that I consider memorable looking back.</p>\n<p>This is only our corner of the world\u2019s Year in Review, not one in general, thus things like Liberation Day are happening in the background and go undiscussed.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">January</h4>\n\n\n<p>The confusions started in January, as we prepared for Trump to take office.</p>\n<p>OpenAI had just given us o1-preview, the first reasoning model.</p>\n<p>At the tail end of 2024, DeepSeek released v3, or <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/deekseek-v3-the-six-million-dollar?r=67wny\"><strong>The Six Million Dollar Model</strong></a>. This was a big advancement in open source and Chinese model capabilities, and showed that they were not as far behind as we thought they were, and also that damn good models could be trained on the cheap. Not as cheap as the headline number, since the six million was only direct costs of the final run, but still pretty cheap.</p>\n<p>Then a few weeks later, <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/on-deepseeks-r1?r=67wny\"><strong>DeepSeek gave us r1</strong></a>, a reasoning model based on v3. They wrapped this up into a nice clean free app experience, which included the first time most people could see a reasoning model\u2019s chain of thought &#8211; Gemini Flash Thinking offered this too but almost no one knew about that or cared. This showed that the \u2018secret sauce\u2019 of building a reasoning model was not so difficult to copy, and the marginal costs of doing so were low.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/deepseek-panic-at-the-app-store?r=67wny\"><strong>DeepSeek shot to the top of the App store</strong></a>, and the world completely lost its mind. <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/deepseek-lemon-its-wednesday?r=67wny\"><strong>The stock market mini-crashed</strong></a>. People talked about how China had \u2018caught up\u2019 to America, or this meant inference would be so cheap no one would need Nvidia chips (as consumers rushed out to buy Nvidia chips to run DeepSeek r1), or how it would destroy margins and drive American AI out of business. I had to warn people, many times, <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/deepseek-dont-panic?r=67wny\"><strong>with the classic advice: Don\u2019t Panic</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ai-model-that-tanked-the-stock-market/id1056200096?i=1000686145901\">I went on Odd Lots to discuss it all</a>.</p>\n<p>Collectively this was called The DeepSeek Moment.</p>\n<p>White House rhetoric talked about how this meant we were in a \u2018race\u2019 with China, so of course any other considerations than \u2018winning\u2019 must be thrown out the window.</p>\n<p>With time, those paying attention realized all of that was overblown. DeepSeek was impressive as a lab, and v3 and r1 were excellent models, but still on the order of eight months behind OpenAI, Anthropic and Google. We had been comparing the relatively best features of r1 on their own, and then using that to project into the future, which flat out did not happen. This happened at a crucial inflection point, right when reasoning models had started, which was when a tiny amount of compute could go a maximally long way.</p>\n<p>Later on, <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/deepseek-r1-0528-did-not-have-a-moment?r=67wny\"><strong>r1-0528 did not have a moment</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/deepseek-v31-is-not-having-a-moment?r=67wny\"><strong>nor did DeepSeek 3.1</strong></a> or <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/deepseek-v32-is-okay-and-cheap-but?r=67wny\"><strong>DeepSeek 3.2</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">February</h4>\n\n\n<p>Google started out the month <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/were-in-deep-research?r=67wny\"><strong>introducing us to Deep Research</strong></a>, a new product form that would be copied by OpenAI, allowing the AI to take time to prepare a report. At the time, this was super impressive. It definitely has its uses, even if the timing is awkward and you have to push past the tendency to pad reports with a lot of slop.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/the-risk-of-gradual-disempowerment?r=67wny\"><strong>new paper on The Risk of Gradual Disempowerment From AI</strong></a> improved the debate by highlighting a central way that humans end up not being in charge. There doesn\u2019t need to be some \u2018AI coup\u2019 or battle, the AIs will by default end up with more and more resources and power unless something stops this from happening. One day we wake up and realize we are not in control. Another day after that we don\u2019t wake up.</p>\n<p>OpenAI declared that its primary alignment strategy <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/on-deliberative-alignment?r=67wny\"><strong>would be Deliberative Alignment</strong></a>, so I analyzed that approach. I think it is helpful, but not a central solution.</p>\n<p>The Administration made its AI feelings clear at <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/the-paris-ai-anti-safety-summit\"><strong>The Paris AI Anti-Safety Summit</strong></a>. Previous summits had been efforts to lay foundation for international cooperation, with serious discussions of existential risks, in particular with <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/138524690/the-bletchley-declaration\">The Bletchley Declaration</a>. That was clearly over, transformed into a disdain for the idea that sufficiently advanced AI could be existentially dangerous, and Vance giving a speech demanding suicidal accelerationism and warning against attempts to not die.</p>\n<p>The year would play out in similar fashion. We had some modest success in California and New York, but the White House would, under the influence of David Sacks, become an active force for interference with efforts to not die, and later even to beat China. They would do some pro-America things along the way, but also things that actively interfered with our competitiveness.</p>\n<p>I introduced a key new concept handle which I call <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/levels-of-friction?r=67wny\"><strong>Levels of Friction</strong></a>. Different actions are variously harder or easier, from both practical and legal perspectives, to do. They range from Level 0 (defaults or requirements), to Level 1 (legal and ubiquitous and easy), Level 2 (safe but annoying), Level 3 (actively tricky or risky), Level 4 (actually seriously illegal) up to Level 5 (we really care about stopping you). Instead of thinking of a boolean of legal-illegal or possible-impossible, it is often more enlightening to consider moving between levels.</p>\n<p>AI is going to move a lot of things to lower levels of friction. That is by default bad, but frictions can be load bearing, such as with job applications or limiting antisocial behaviors. It protects the commons. We will have to adjust quite a lot of things once key frictions are removed from the system.</p>\n<p>February was the peak of <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/grok-grok?r=67wny\"><strong>\u2018could Grok be a thing?</strong></a>\u2019 It turned out not to be a thing. In other model news we got <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/time-to-welcome-claude-37?r=67wny\"><strong>Claude 3.7</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>We also got our first introduction to <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/on-emergent-misalignment?r=67wny\"><strong>Emergent Misalignment</strong></a>, the idea that training the AI to do bad things associated with evil could lead it to generalize into thinking of itself as trope-style evil and doing a wide range of trope-style evil things.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">March</h4>\n\n\n<p>A non-AI highlight was my piece on elementary education, <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/childhood-and-education-9-school?r=67wny\"><strong>School Is Hell</strong></a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/on-gpt-45?r=67wny\"><strong>GPT-4.5</strong></a> was OpenAI\u2019s attempt to give us a large and slow model. It did some cool things, and there are people that really liked it, but mostly it wasn\u2019t worthwhile.</p>\n<p>A big part of AI coverage is getting confident in dismissing hype. A great example of this was my coverage of <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/the-manus-marketing-madness?r=67wny\"><strong>The Manus Marketing Madness</strong></a>. Now that they\u2019ve unceremoniously sold out to Meta, it\u2019s easy to forget that a lot of people were hyping Manus as The Next Big Thing, as well as the next reason we would Lose To China.</p>\n<p>I warned against using <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/the-most-forbidden-technique?r=67wny\"><strong>The Most Forbidden Technique</strong></a>, which is where you use interpretability to train on intermediate outputs, to teach it to think the thoughts you want it to think, thus teaching the AI to, like humans before it, hide its thinking.</p>\n<p>Image generation had its first big moment, when the <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/fun-with-gpt-4o-image-generation?r=67wny\"><strong>4o image generator came online</strong></a> and everyone went Studio Ghibli crazy, taking advantage of both the advancement in quality and willingness to mimic styles.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/gemini-25-is-the-new-sota?r=67wny\"><strong>Gemini 2.5 Pro came out</strong></a>, which I called the new state of the art.

Initially this rhetoric and action <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/america-makes-ai-chip-diffusion-deal?r=67wny\"><strong>was confined to sales to parties like UAE and KSA</strong></a>, where a case can be made if the deals and safeguards are good, and details matter.

This would be their big moment to unify all their crazy model variations and names, and create one model to rule them all, with a router to think longer if and only if that was worthwhile. There were approaching death stars and we saw a variety of assertive valueposting. It was the big version number jump, and people expected a lot.</p>\n<p>GPT-5 was a good model, I found it to be a clear upgrade, but it very much did not live up to the hype. Many even strongly wanted to keep GPT-4o for its far friendlier and more empathic attitude, or some would say its sycophancy &#8211; the very features that make GPT-4o not a great thing for many users are alas the reasons users often like it so much. I covered the <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/gpt-5s-are-alive-basic-facts-benchmarks?r=67wny\"><strong>basic facts and model card</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/gpt-5s-are-alive-outside-reactions?r=67wny\"><strong>then outside reactions</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/gpt-5s-are-alive-synthesis?r=67wny\"><strong>finally created a synthesis</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the model OpenAI chose to call GPT-5 being a disappointing release gave so many people, up to and including David Sacks and Sriram Krishnan at the White House, the wrong idea. There is a constant demand for data points that say AI won\u2019t advance much, that scaling is dead, that it will all be a normal technology and you don\u2019t have to worry about AGI. Washington seems to have come away from the GPT-5 release with this message, and it plausibly did great harm in numerous ways, including to our export controls.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/reports-of-ai-not-progressing-or?r=67wny\"><strong>I tried to push directly back against this,</strong></a> pointing out that AI was continuing to make rapid progress, both around GPT-5 and various other misleading data points, especially the no-good, very-bad \u2018MIT study.\u2019 I followed up by pointing out that <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/yes-ai-continues-to-make-rapid-progress?r=67wny\"><strong>Yes, AI Continues To Make Rapid Progress, Including Towards AGI</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>I noticed <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/arguments-about-ai-consciousness?r=67wny\"><strong>I was deeply confused about AI consciousness</strong></a>, along with everyone else.

The Chinese are making a show of not wanting them so much, but it\u2019s a show, and our edge has been substantially eroded.

The final terms came as the result of negotiations with the District Attorneys of Delaware and California, and they did extract a lot of highly meaningful concessions, both in terms of compensation and also in helping retain meaningful control and oversight over OpenAI. This could have gone so much worse.

The news about it is accelerating, not slowing down. It\u2019s going to increasingly impact our lives and be the topic of conversation. The model releases will come fast and furious. The agents will make big leaps in 2026, and not only for coding. It will likely be a major topic in the midterm elections. I don\u2019t expect full High Weirdness in 2026, but you can\u2019t fully rule it out.</p>\n<p>Blog growth, in terms of views, stagnated this year. That\u2019s disappointing, as previously I had experienced strong growth, and I likely need to explore additional ways to get the word out. But \u2018number go up\u2019 was never the ultimate goal and I am confident that I am directly reaching quite a lot of the people I care about reaching. I do intend to send out a user survey some time in the near future.</p>\n<p>One big personal goal for 2026 is to do more coding and evergreen posting, going deeper into questions that matter or that I get curious about, and being better about organizing my thoughts, and to focus less on ephemeral items and news, and to finally get a handle on organizing what I do have to better create longer term resources. I am fully aware that almost all views happen within a few days of posting, but that doesn\u2019t need to dictate anything, and there are some basic things where I could build permanent resources much better than I\u2019ve been doing.</p>\n<p>The other big goal is to focus on what matters, including the fights and debates that matter, making sure to do that in a way that adds to permanent resources and not let important things end up buried. I have to do better triage, especially in letting relatively unimportant matters drop. I intend to publish fewer words on the blog in 2026, and with that to become more willing to skip days. I know the amount of content can be overwhelming.</p>\n<p>One thing that got lost in the shuffle this year, and illustrates the problem, was my planned review of Open Socrates. It\u2019s a book warning you not to live your life 15 minutes at a time, and I didn\u2019t finish my response because life kept throwing too much stuff at me. Well, that\u2019s kind of the worst possible excuse not to finish that, isn\u2019t it? Even if because of the delay I ultimately have to reread a lot of the book.</p>\n<p>I also have a bunch of projects I\u2019d love to try. We\u2019ll see how that goes. But also movies to watch, and games to play, and people to see, and fun to be had. Life beckons.</p>\n<p>And you know what? Life is pretty awesome.

Often, the &ldquo;bug&rdquo; is ambiguity in the prompt that led to sub-optimal tool usage. That makes <em>me</em> feel better, but it doesn&rsquo;t make the folks relying on these tools feel any better: they just expect the tools to work.</p> <p>This means that debugging unexpected behavior is a significant part of rolling out agents internally, and it&rsquo;s important to make it easy enough to do it frequently. If it takes too much time, effort or too many permissions, then your agents simply won&rsquo;t get used.</p> <h2 id=\"how-we-implemented-logging\">How we implemented logging</h2> <p>Our agents run in an AWS Lambda, so the very first pass at logging was simply printing to standard out to be captured in the Lambda&rsquo;s logs.
