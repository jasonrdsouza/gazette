                "<p>The promise of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager\">password manager</a> is that it remembers and autofills all of your passwords, so you only have to remember one \u2013 the password that unlocks your password manager.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, I have a handful passwords that I think worth memorising.\nIt\u2019s still a short list, but I\u2019m not convinced that a single password is either sensible or feasible.\nI\u00a0generally trust my password manager, but I don\u2019t want it to be a single point of failure for my entire digital life.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-passwords-do-i-try-to-remember\">What passwords do I try to remember?</h2>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>The login password for my computer.</strong>\nI configure my Mac to sleep after a few minutes of inactivity, then ask for my login password when I try to resume.\nAlthough I often use Touch\u00a0ID to log in, I remember this password because I still have to enter it multiple times a day.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>The master password for my password manager.</strong>\nThis unlocks all of my other passwords.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>The login passcode for my phone.</strong>\nI use an alphanumeric password, and I remember it because I have to enter it multiple times a day.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>My email password.</strong>\nMy email account is the gateway to all my other digital accounts.\nIf I lost access to my password manager but could still receive email, I could reset my passwords and regain access to everything.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>My remote backup password.</strong>\nI have offsite backups of all of my computers with Backblaze.\nIf all of my devices were destroyed at once (for example, in a house fire), this would allow me to retrieve files from my backups, even without access to my password manager.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>The encryption password for my multi-factor authentication (MFA) recovery codes.</strong>\nI have an MFA app on my phone, protected by Face\u00a0ID or my passcode \u2013 but in an emergency, I have single-use recovery codes I can use instead.\nThese are stored in <a href=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2026/recovery-codes/\">an\u00a0encrypted disk image</a>.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>My Apple Account password.</strong>\nI\u2019m heavily enmeshed in the Apple ecosystem, and this account has powerful access to my devices, including remote wiping and backups.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>The \u201cmemorable word\u201d for my online banking.</strong>\nWhen I log in to my bank account, my password manager autofills a password, and then I have to fill in three characters of a longer \u201cmemorable word\u201d.\nFor example, I might be asked to enter the 1st, 5th, and 8th characters.</p>\n\n    <p>I memorise this both for security and convenience.\nIf somebody compromises my password manager, my bank account is safe \u2013 and even if this was in my password manager, it can\u2019t fill in single characters this way.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All of these passwords are long, alphanumeric, and unique.</p>\n\n<p>I have a regular calendar reminder to review them, and make sure I still remember them correctly.\nThis would be a useful feature in a password manager \u2013 periodic tests on whether you still remember important passwords.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"where-are-these-passwords-stored\">Where are these passwords stored?</h2>\n\n<p>Although I\u2019ve memorised all eight passwords, there are some copies elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Five of them are stored in my password manager, because it\u2019s convenient: my computer\u2019s login password, my phone\u2019s login passcode, my email password, my remote backup password, and my Apple account password.\n(My email and Apple account are protected by multi-factor authentication, and the codes aren\u2019t in my password manager.)</p>\n\n<p>Two of them aren\u2019t written down anywhere, but they might be soon: the master password for my password manager, and the encryption password for my MFA recovery codes.\nAt some point I\u2019d like to change this, probably with a paper copy in a fire safe or similar.\nThis would allow my family to retrieve those passwords in an emergency.</p>\n\n<p>The \u201cmemorable word\u201d for my online banking isn\u2019t written down anywhere, and I doubt it ever will be.\nIf I lose access to my bank account and I\u2019m really stuck, I can visit a physical branch.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-would-i-regain-access-to-my-accounts\">How would I regain access to my accounts?</h2>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s how I\u2019d get back into my key accounts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Remote backups.</strong>\nMy Backblaze account is only protected with a password, not MFA.\nI\u00a0have this memorised, so I could download files from my remote backups on any device.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>MFA recovery codes.</strong>\nThese are in an encrypted disk image in my remote backups.\nI\u2019ve memorised the disk image password, so I could retrieve my MFA codes once I get to my remote backups.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Email inbox.</strong>\nThis is protected by a password and MFA.\nI\u2019ve memorised the password, and I could use an MFA recovery code to regain access to the account.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Password manager.</strong>\n I use 1Password.\nLogging in on a new device needs two secrets: my Master Password and <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/secret-key/\">Secret Key</a>.</p>\n\n    <p>I remember the former, but the latter is a random UUID I don\u2019t type in or see regularly.\nInstead, I have a 1Password <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/emergency-kit/\">Emergency Kit</a> which includes my Secret Key (but not my Master Password).\nI\u00a0have a printed copy of this kit in my folder of important papers, and a digital copy in my disk image of MFA recovery codes.</p>\n\n    <p>If I can get a copy of the Emergency Kit, I can regain access to my password manager.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-passwords-dont-i-remember\">What passwords don\u2019t I remember?</h2>\n\n<p>There are a couple of important passwords you might expect me to memorise, but I don\u2019t:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>The email password for my work email.</strong>\nThis password is stored in the password manager I use at work, and if I unexpectedly lost access, I\u2019d contact the IT team for help.\nI\u00a0don\u2019t need self-service recovery for this account.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>The master password for my password manager at work.</strong>\nFor similar reasons to work email, I\u2019d rely on the IT team to regain access in an emergency.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>My banking app username or password password.</strong>\nLogging into my bank requires three values: my username, the full-length password, and the \u201cmemorable information\u201d.\nI\u2019ve memorised the memorable information, but not the username or password.\nIf I need emergency access to my bank account, I can visit a high street branch.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-scenario-am-i-trying-to-prevent\">What scenario am I trying to prevent?</h2>\n\n<p>Imagine you lost all of your devices.\nCould you regain access to your digital life?\nThat\u2019s my worst-case scenario that I\u2019m trying to avoid, and these memorised passwords should be enough to bootstrap everything.</p>\n\n<p>I can retrieve my MFA recovery codes from my remote backups, and then I can either log into my password manager and retrieve the current passwords, or log into my email inbox and reset all my passwords.\nEither way, I\u2019m back into my accounts.</p>\n\n<p>This doesn\u2019t cover the scenario where I lose access to both my email inbox and my password manager, but that would be a catastrophic digital disaster.</p>\n\n<p>It also doesn\u2019t cover the scenario where I\u2019m incapacitated and a family member needs emergency access to my digital accounts.\nThat\u2019s something I\u2019m planning to fix this year.\nMy plan is to purchase a fire safe that somebody else can open, in which I\u2019d place printed instructions for access my password manager.\nInside my password manager, I\u2019ll have a note that explains what the key accounts are, which I can update regularly without reopening the safe.</p>\n\n<p>I hope I can continue to rely on my password manager, and I never encounter one of these emergency scenarios \u2013 but I feel better knowing I\u2019ve tried to prepare.</p>\n\n\n

                "<p>When I read advice about passwords and online accounts, it usually goes something like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Create unique passwords for each account, and store them in a password manager.</li>\n  <li>Enable <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication\">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a>, and use an authenticator app or hardware token as your second factor.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>But enabling MFA isn\u2019t everything \u2013 what if you lose access to that second factor?\nFor example, I store my MFA codes in an app on my phone.\nWhat happens if my phone is broken or stolen?</p>\n\n<p>Most services that support MFA give me a set of recovery codes I can use in an emergency to regain access to my account, but don\u2019t explain what to do with them.\nI\u2019m advised to \u201cstore them securely\u201d, but what does that mean in practice?</p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t want to store my recovery codes in my password manager, because that compresses multiple authentication factors back into one.\nSomebody who compromised my password manager would have access to everything.\n(That\u2019s the same reason I don\u2019t store my MFA codes in there.)</p>\n\n<p>Instead, I have an encrypted disk image on my Mac, which I created using Disk Utility.\nThe password is a long, unique password that I only use for this purpose, and I only keep the disk image mounted when I\u2019m editing or using a recovery code.</p>\n\n<p>This disk image contains two files:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>My 1Password <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/emergency-kit/\">Emergency Kit</a>, a PDF document that contains the details for my 1Password account \u2013 including a secret key that I don\u2019t see or type on a day-to-day basis</li>\n  <li>An HTML file I write by hand, which has all my MFA recovery codes and notes on when I created them</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what the HTML file looks like (with fake data, obviously):</p>\n\n<source type=\"image/png\" /><img alt=\"A page with a couple of sections (headed 'Apple Account', 'Etsy', 'GitHub').

Instead, they are ordered from static to dynamic code generation &#8212; where more and more the <em>intent</em> of a customer is the software they use.</p><h3>Stage 1. Traditional SaaS</h3><p>This is the baseline where software is a static artifact sold as a service, built on the assumption that user problems are repetitive and predictable enough to be solved by rigid workflows. To the consumer, this looks like dashboards, CRUD forms, and hardcoded automations. The intelligence here is sourced mainly from the SaaS founder and hired domain experts, hard-coded into business logic years before the user ever logs in.</p><ul><li><p><strong>When:</strong> We recognized that distributing software via the cloud was more efficient than on-premise installations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Value Loop:</strong> Customer Problem &#8594; Product Manager writes PRD &#8594; Engineers write Static Code &#8594; Deploy &#8594; Customer adapts their workflow to the tool. <strong>(Time: Months to Years | Fit: Generic / One-size-fits-none)</strong></p></li></ul><h3>Stage 2. FDEs and AI Builders</h3><p>We are seeing this now with companies adopting the <a href=\"https://builders.ramp.com/post/forward-deployed-engineering\">Forward Deployed Engineering (FDE)</a>. In this stage, the SaaS company hires humans to manually use AI to build bespoke solutions for the client. For the consumer, this feels like a concierge service; they don&#8217;t get a login to a generic tool, they get a custom-built outcome delivered by a human who used AI to write the glue code. The intelligence is hybrid: the human provides the architecture, the AI writes the implementation code in weeks to days.</p><ul><li><p><strong>When:</strong> Companies realize AI allows their employees to build custom apps for clients faster than the clients can learn or adapt a generic tool.</p></li><li><p><strong>Value Loop:</strong> Customer Problem &#8594; SaaS Employee (FDE) Prompts AI &#8594; AI generates Custom Script/App &#8594; Employee Deploys for Customer. <strong>(Time: Days | Fit: High / Tailored to specific customer edge cases)</strong></p></li></ul><h3>Stage 3. AI Features (Product is Platform/Interface)</h3><p>This is the current &#8220;safe space&#8221; for most tech companies, where they bolt an LLM onto an existing application to handle unstructured data. Consumers experience this as a &#8220;Draft Email&#8221; button in their CRM or a &#8220;Chat&#8221; sidebar in their UI&#8212;the platform is still the main product, but AI is a feature that (hopefully) reduces friction and/or provides some extra functionality customization<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://blog.sshh.io/feed#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a>. The intelligence comes from a constrained model of product design and LLM scaffolding, providing content within a structure still strictly dictated by the SaaS platform&#8217;s code.</p><ul><li><p><strong>When:</strong> People start to see AI is good at summarizing, generating content, or taking actions within existing workflows.</p></li><li><p><strong>Value Loop:</strong> Customer Problem &#8594; Static SaaS Interface AI Feature Text Box &#8594; Stochastic Result &#8594; Human Review. <strong>(Time: Minutes | Fit: Medium / Constrained by the platform&#8217;s UI)</strong></p></li></ul><h3>Stage 4. AI Products (Product is Data/Context)</h3><p>This is the tipping point where the software interface starts to disappear because the &#8220;interface&#8221; was just a way to collect context that the model can now ingest directly. Consumers move to a &#8220;Do this for me&#8221; interface where intent maps directly to an outcome rather than a button click, often realized as an agent calling a database or <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/\">MCP servers</a><a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://blog.sshh.io/feed#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a>. The intelligence is the model and it&#8217;s engineered input context, relegating the SaaS role to in some sense providing clean proprietary data via an agent friendly interface. Software as a Service <em>for Agents</em>.</p><ul><li><p><strong>When:</strong> People start to see AI is good at orchestrating complex decisions and using tools&#8212;across SaaS platforms&#8212;autonomously.</p></li><li><p><strong>Value Loop:</strong> Customer Problem (Prompt as ~PRD) &#8594; Runtime Code Generation &#8594; Dynamic Outcome. <strong>(Time: Real-time | Fit: Very High / Dynamically generated for the specific context)</strong></p></li></ul><p>Critically, this doesn't mean the LLM acts as the CPU for every single user interaction (which would be latency-poor and energy-inefficient). Instead, the model almost acts as a Just-In-Time compiler. It generates the necessary code to execute the user&#8217;s intent, runs that code for the session, and then potentially discards it</p><h3>Stage 5. AI Training Environments</h3><p>This is the end game in some cases. If code is just a cache for intent, eventually we bypass the cache and bake the intuition directly into the model. To the consumer, the &#8220;tool&#8221; is invisible; the expert system simply exists and provides answers or actions without a login or workflow. The intelligence is in the model itself; the software platform exists solely as a distillation mechanism&#8212;a gym to train the vertical AI&#8212;and once the model learns the domain, the software is no longer needed. A company in this stage is not really even SaaS anymore, maybe more so a <em>AI-gyms-aaS</em> company.</p><ul><li><p><strong>When:</strong> People start to see AI is good at absorbing the entire vertical&#8217;s intuition.</p></li><li><p><strong>Value Loop:</strong> Raw Domain Data &#8594; Reinforcement Learning / Fine-Tuning &#8594; Model Weights. <strong>(Time: Instant / Pre-computed | Fit: Very High / Intuitive domain mastery)</strong></p></li></ul><p>This might feel unintuitive as a stage &#8212; like how could you bake some proprietary data lake into a model? How can our juicy data not be the moat? My conclusion is that most (but not all) data is a transformation of rawer upstream inputs and that these transformation (data pipelines, cross-tenant analysis, human research, etc.) are all &#8220;cache&#8221; that can be distilled into a more general model that operates on its intuition and upstream platform inputs.</p><h3>Rebuttals</h3><p><strong>&#8220;But can agents run a bank?&#8221;</strong> Reliability and safety comes down to distinguishing between guardrails (deterministic interfaces and scaffolding) and runtime execution (LLM code). For now, you don&#8217;t let the LLM invent the concept of a transaction ledger or rewrite the core banking loop on the fly. In XX years, maybe we do trust AI to write core transaction logic after all fail-able humans wrote the code for most mission critical software that exists today. The line between human-defined determinism and agent symbolic interfaces will gradually move of time. </p><p><strong>&#8220;But enterprise SaaS is actually super complex.&#8221;</strong> Yes, but that complexity is mostly just unresolved ambiguity. Your &#8220;deep enterprise understanding&#8221; is often a collection of thousands of edge cases&#8212;permissions, policy exceptions, region-specific rules&#8212;that humans had to manually hard-code into IF/ELSE statements over a decade. Distilled to the core, this complexity collapses. The model doesn&#8217;t need 500 hard-coded features; it needs the raw data and the intent. An app built for one can also make a lot of simplifications compared to one that acts as a platform.</p><p><strong>&#8220;Customers don&#8217;t want to prompt features.&#8221;</strong> I agree. I don&#8217;t think the future looks like a chatbot. &#8220;Chat&#8221; is a skeuomorphic bridge we use because we haven&#8217;t figured out the consistent native interface yet. It might be a UI that pre-emptively changes based on your role, or it might feel like hiring a really competent employee who just &#8220;takes care of it&#8221; without you needing to specify the <code>how</code>. Or, as we see in Stage 2, the user never prompts at all&#8212;an FDE does it for them, and the user just gets a bespoke app that works perfectly.</p><h2>Is SaaS Dead?</h2><p>Stage 1, where most companies are stuck today, definitely is.</p><p>Why? Because the sheer overhead of traditional SaaS&#8212;the learning curve, the rigid workflows, the \"click tax\" to get work done&#8212;is becoming unacceptable in a world where intent can be executed directly. It feels increasingly archaic when flexible solutions can be generated on demand.</p><p>The value is moving away from the workflow logic itself and toward two specific layers that sandwich it:</p><ol><li><p><strong>The Data Layer:</strong> Proprietary data, trust, and the &#8220;agentic scaffolding&#8221; that allows models to act safely within your domain. </p></li><li><p><strong>The Presentation Layer:</strong> Brand and UI. While I suspect trying to control the presentation layer long-term is futile (as users will eventually bring their own &#8220;interface agents&#8221; to interact with your data), for now, it remains a differentiator.</p></li></ol><p>We are going to see companies move through these tiers. The winners IMO will be the ones who realize that the \"Service\" part of SaaS is being replaced by model intelligence. The SaaS that remains will be the infrastructure of truth and the engine of agency.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>We are transitioning from a world of static artifacts (code that persists for years) to dynamic generations (code that exists for milliseconds or for a single answer).</p><p>Of course, I could be wrong. Maybe AI capability plateaus before it can fully integrate into complex verticals. Maybe traditional SaaS holds the line at Stage 2 or 3, protecting its moat through sheer inertia. Maybe the world ends up more decentralized.</p><p>Some of my open questions:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Which stage should you work on today?</strong> Is there alpha in skipping straight to Stage 4, or do you need to build the Stage 2 &#8220;vibe coding&#8221; service to bootstrap for now?</p></li><li><p><strong>What are the interfaces of the future?</strong> Is it MCP, curated compute sandboxes, or a yet-to-be-defined agent-to-agent-to-human protocol? What interface wins out or does each company or consumer bring their own agentic worker?</p></li><li><p><strong>How fast does this happen?</strong> Are we looking at a multi-decade-long transition, or do companies today rapidly start dropping lower stage SaaS tools?</p></li><li><p><strong>Does AI have a similar impact beyond software?</strong> does medicine move from &#8220;static protocols&#8221; to &#8220;on-demand, patient-specific treatments&#8221;?</p></li></ul><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Thanks for reading Shrivu&#8217;s Substack!
