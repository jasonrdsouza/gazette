From being annoyed by straw men and non sequiturs to accepting them and the haters as a natural consequence of success.

Nobody is mad at you, nobody is making any bad-faith arguments, but also, nobody cares. Lots of work exists in this zone. And that's fine. We don't need every project to reach the moon! But when escape velocity is achieved, you can't avoid drawing energy from both sides.<br /><br />All this isn't to say that all objections, skepticism, or criticisms come from haters. Far from it. But once sufficient success is secured, a large portion will. It's just that kind of planet, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lkp3FIyx6co\">as Jim Rohn would say</a>.<br /><br />The trick is to see this in aggregate as a necessary milestone. One that's even worth celebrating! Have you even made something worth cheering for, if there isn't a contingent there to boo at it too? Probably not.<br /><br />So embrace the boos as you embrace the cheers. They come as a pair.</div>\n</div>"
