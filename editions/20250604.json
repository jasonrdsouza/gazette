I didn&apos;t want to get into the distinction between skilled and unskilled because people take offence to it, but AI is a matter of skill. </p><blockquote>Someone can be highly experienced as a software engineer in 2024, but that does not mean they&apos;re skilled as a software engineer in 2025, now that AI is here. </blockquote><p>In my view, LLMs are essentially mirrors. They mirror the skill of the operator. </p><h1 id=\"how-to-identify-skill\">how to identify skill</h1><p>One of the most pressing issues for all companies going forward is the question of how to identify skilled operators. In the blog post &quot;<a href=\"https://ghuntley.com/screwed/\">Dear Student: Yes, AI is here, you&apos;re screwed unless you take action</a>&quot; I remarked that the interviewing process is now fundamentally broken. </p><blockquote>With hundreds of thousands of dollars at stake, all the incentives are there for candidates to cheat. The video below is one of many tools that now exist today that hook the video render of macOS and provide overlays (similar to how OpenGL game hacks work) that can&apos;t be detected by screen recording software or Zoom.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"></figure><blockquote>The software interview process was never great but it&apos;s taken a turn for the worst as AI can easily solve any thing thrown at it - including interview screenings.

Either they&apos;re going to miss out on outstanding candidates, or there&apos;s going to be the birth of &quot;shadow AI&quot;, where all the employees use AI in stealth.</p><p>It&apos;s already happening. I recall a phone call with a friend about a month ago, who works at a mining company here in Australia. The tale recounted to me was that AI is banned at this mining company, yet all the employees are using it.  Employees, by now, are well aware of the &quot;<a href=\"https://ghuntley.com/ngmi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">not going to make it</a>&quot; factors at play.</p><p>If I were interviewing a candidate now, the first things I&apos;d ask them to explain would be the fundamentals of <a href=\"https://ghuntley.com/mcp\" rel=\"noreferrer\">how the Model Context Protocol works</a> and <a href=\"https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent?ref=ghuntley.com\">how to build an agent</a>.

Why?</p><p>For each one of the LLMs, what are they good at and what are they terrible at?</p><p>How have the behaviours of each one of the LLMs changed? The more detail they can provide about emergent behaviours and how it has changed across the different iterations, the better. It&apos;s a strong signal that they&apos;ve been playing for a while.</p><p>Is there a project that they can show me? Potentially open source, where they built something? A conference talk? A blog post? Anything. Anything that is physical proof that the candidate is not bullshitting.</p><p>Do they have their <a href=\"https://ghuntley.com/stdlib\" rel=\"noreferrer\">own personal standard library of prompts</a>?</p><p>I&apos;d ask them about which coding agents they&apos;ve used and their frustrations with them. Then I dig deeper to see if they&apos;ve become curious and have gone down a path to build their own solutions to overcome these problems.</p><p>Have they built an agentic supervisor? If they have, that&apos;s a really strong signal, but only if they can explain how they built it. What are the trade-offs found in building it? How did they solve overbaking or underbaking? Or the halting problem?</p><p>How have they used <a href=\"https://ghuntley.com/mcp\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Model Context Protocol to automate software development</a> to see if they&apos;ve become curious and have gone down a path to automate things at their previous employer?</p><blockquote>Now, there are some smooth talkers out there and all that can be memorised. For instance, people can simply talk their way through all the above. So this is where the real challenge begins. </blockquote><p><strong>You want to watch them</strong>. <em>You want to watch them dance with the LLM.</em> </p><p>Full screen share and see how they dance with it. Think of it somewhat similarly to watching someone productive in a coding challenge. If they waste time by not using the debugger, not adding debug log statements, or failing to write tests, then they&apos;re not a good fit.</p><p>If they conduct endless chat operations with the coding agent and <a href=\"https://ghuntley.com/gutter\" rel=\"noreferrer\">fail to recycle the context window frequently</a>, then they&apos;re not a good fit. If they heavily rely upon AI-powered tab completion, they&apos;re probably not a good fit.</p><p>If they lead by saying &quot;I don&apos;t know&quot; and show behaviours where they drive an LLM by asking it questions to <a href=\"https://ghuntley.com/specs\" rel=\"noreferrer\">build up a specification</a> and loading up the context window, we have observations and just really like asking the LLM questions. That&apos;s a pretty strong indication that they are a good fit.</p><p>If you walk away after the interview, where the candidate taught you a new meta, then that&apos;s a great fit. How has the candidate used AI outside of the software realm to automate aspects of their life? Go deep! Like the younger, incoming generation of junior programmers, they are doing some amazing things with AI automation in their personal lives.</p><p>Do they loop the LLM back on itself? For example, let&apos;s say you had a function, and the performance of that function was slow. Are they aware that you could ask the LLM to create a benchmark suite, add profiling, and then loop the profiling results back onto the LLM and ask it to fix it?</p><p>Do they understand the code that has been generated? Can they explain it? Can they critique it? Do they show any indicators of taste?</p><p>Are they overly controlling of the coding agent? Now, interestingly enough, one thing I&apos;ve personally learned is that the best outcomes come when you are less controlling. That doesn&apos;t mean brain off. It means that they understand that there is a meta where you can ask the agent to do the most critical thing in a series of tasks. The LLM can decide that the logging module should be implemented first in the project before proceeding to implement the rest of the project&apos;s specifications. </p><p>What was the workflow that they used? Did they spin up one or multiple coding agents side by side? That&apos;s a sign of an advanced operator. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Wanna build great shit, at record speed? <br /><br />Here are the cheat codes...<br /><br />All the little pieces and how to connect em...<br /><br />Run this as while(true) in a tool that does not cap tool call invocations.

That experience is entirely understandable. </p><p>However, I <a href=\"https://ghuntley.com/ngmi\">do worry about engineers</a> whose only experience with AI is using it in a large, proprietary codebase. Have they tried AI at home? Are they putting in deliberate, intentional practice? Have they discovered the beauty of AI?</p><p>You see, there is a beauty in AI. And the way I like to describe it these days, they are kind of like a musical instrument. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img alt=\"deliberate intentional practice\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://ghuntley.com/content/images/2025/06/image.png\" width=\"1280\" /><figcaption><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">the tb303 was a commercial failure upon launch but many years later someone started playing: twisting knobs in strange and wonderful ways that resulted in new genres of music being created.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let&apos;s take a guitar as an example.

A couple of moments later, we opened a coding assistant and then built a calculator in COBOL. And we&apos;re just sitting there watching, just going, wow. So we then decided, hey, because in the spirit of play, can it do a Reverse Polish notation calculator? And it turns out it can. </p><p>At this stage, our brains were just racing and we&apos;re riffing. Like, what are the <em>other</em> possibilities of what AI can do? What can it and cannot do? So we asked it to write unit tests in COBOL, and it did it. </p><p>So next thing we know, we&apos;re like, okay, let&apos;s take this up a level even further. Let&apos;s create a Reverse Polish Notation Calculator in COBOL, but use emojis as operators. Does COBOL even support emojis? Well, there&apos;s one way to find out.</p><p>It turns out that it is indeed possible.

It&apos;s where you approach an instrument or, in this case, AI, with the intention of  not achieving much, but just picking it up, giving it a strum and then having an open mind to the possibilities that you might discover something new or a new meta.</p><h2 id=\"closing-thoughts\">closing thoughts</h2><p>Now, I completely empathise with people who say AI does not work for them in their legacy code base. The context windows that exist for AI are small. </p><p>The way I look at it is that if we were in the 1980s and only had IBM XT computers, but time would eventually pass, and we&apos;d get the 286s, and so on. While we&apos;ll see context windows get bigger, they won&apos;t be big enough for some of these companies&apos; codebases, but that doesn&apos;t mean hope is all lost.</p><blockquote>What I do wonder however, is if we&apos;re going to start to see some very interesting employee versus employer dynamics unfold in the future.  </blockquote><p>There was a time when employees decided to move on from a company because they weren&apos;t adopting AWS. See, employees exchange skills and time for money. </p><p>The industry advances, and employees seek to keep their skills current. They knew that if they didn&apos;t upskill in AWS, they would have a hard time continuing to exchange their skills for money. AI not working for a particular company is a company problem, not a problem for the employee. </p><p>Hope is not lost for companies that experience difficulties with AI. This space is evolving rapidly, with AI improving daily, and there is still much more research to be conducted on topics such as semantic analysis and integration with build system graphs. </p><p>Pondering these types of things is now part of my day job, and I hope to delve into these aspects soon. If you work at a company with a massive monorepository, please <a href=\"https://ghuntley.com/contact\" rel=\"noreferrer\">say hello</a>.
