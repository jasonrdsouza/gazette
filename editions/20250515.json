                "<p>They say you can\u2019t truly hate someone unless you loved them first. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true as a general principle, but it certainly describes my relationship with NumPy.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://numpy.org/\">NumPy</a>, by the way, is some software that does computations on arrays in Python. It\u2019s insanely popular and has had a huge influence on all the popular machine learning libraries like PyTorch. These libraries share most of the same issues I discuss below, but I\u2019ll stick to NumPy for concreteness.</p>\n\n<p>NumPy makes easy things easy. Say <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">A</code> is a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">5\u00d75</code> matrix, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">x</code> is a length-5 vector, and you want to find the vector <em>y</em> such that <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Ay=x</code>. In NumPy, that would be:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">linalg</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">solve</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>So elegant! So clear!</p>\n\n<p>But say the situation is even a <em>little</em> more complicated. Say <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">A</code> is a stack of 100 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">5\u00d75</code> matrices, given as a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">100\u00d75\u00d75</code> array. And say <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">x</code> is a stack of 100 length-5 vectors, given as a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">100\u00d75</code> array. And say you want to solve <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">A\u1d62y\u1d62=x\u1d62</code> for <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1\u2264i\u2264100</code>.</p>\n\n<p>If you could use loops, this would be easy:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">empty_like</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"nb\">range</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">100</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">,:]</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">linalg</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">solve</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">,:,:],</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">,:])</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>But you can\u2019t use loops. To some degree, this is a limitation of loops being slow in Python. But nowadays, everything is GPU and if you\u2019ve got big arrays, you probably don\u2019t want to use loops in any language. To get all those transistors firing, you need to call special GPU functions that will sort of split up the arrays into lots of little pieces and process them in parallel.</p>\n\n<p>The good news is that NumPy knows about those special routines (at least if you use <a href=\"https://github.com/jax-ml/jax\">JAX</a> or <a href=\"https://cupy.dev/\">CuPy</a>), and if you call <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">np.linalg.solve</code> correctly, it will use them.</p>\n\n<p>The bad news is that no one knows how do that.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t believe me?

And let me show you something else. Here\u2019s the <a href=\"https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.solve.html\">documentation</a>:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"np.linalg.solve\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/numpy/solve.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>Read that. Meditate on it. Now, notice: You <em>still</em> don\u2019t know how to solve <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">A\u1d62y\u1d62=x\u1d62</code> for all <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">i</code> at once. Is it even possible? Did I lie when I said it was?</p>\n\n<p>As far as I can tell, what people actually do is try random variations until one seems to work.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-numpy-bad\">Why NumPy bad</h2>\n\n<p>NumPy is all about applying operations to arrays. When the arrays have 2 or fewer dimensions, everything is fine. But if you\u2019re doing something even mildly complicated, you inevitably find yourself with some operation you want to apply to some dimensions of array <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">A</code>, some other dimensions of array <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">B</code>, and some <em>other</em> dimensions of array <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">C</code>. And NumPy has no theory for how to express that.</p>\n\n<p>Let me show you what I mean. Suppose:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">A</code> is a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">K\u00d7L\u00d7M</code> array</li>\n  <li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">B</code> is a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">L\u00d7N</code> array</li>\n  <li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">C</code> is a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">K\u00d7M</code> array</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And say that for each <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">k</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">n</code>, you\u2019d like to compute the mean over the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">L</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">M</code> dimensions. That is, you want</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0  <code>D<sub>kn</sub> = 1/(LM) \u00d7 \u2211<sub>lm</sub> A<sub>klm</sub> B<sub>ln</sub> C<sub>km</sub>.</code></p>\n\n<p>To do that, you\u2019ve got two options. The first is to use grotesque dimension alignment tricks:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">D</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">mean</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">mean</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n            <span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"p\">[:,:,:,</span><span class=\"bp\">None</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span>\n            <span class=\"n\">B</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"bp\">None</span><span class=\"p\">,:,</span><span class=\"bp\">None</span><span class=\"p\">,:]</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span>\n            <span class=\"n\">C</span><span class=\"p\">[:,</span><span class=\"bp\">None</span><span class=\"p\">,:,</span><span class=\"bp\">None</span><span class=\"p\">],</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">axis</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">),</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">axis</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The hell, you ask? Why is <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">None</code> everywhere? Well, when indexing an array in NumPy, you can write <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">None</code> to insert a new dimension. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">A</code> is <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">K\u00d7L\u00d7M</code>, but <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">A[:,:,:,None]</code> is <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">K\u00d7L\u00d7M\u00d7</code><strong><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1</code></strong>. Similarly, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">B[None,:,None,:]</code> is <strong><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1</code></strong><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\u00d7L\u00d7</code><strong><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1</code></strong><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\u00d7N</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">C[:,None,:,None]</code> is <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">K\u00d7</code><strong><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1</code></strong><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\u00d7M\u00d7</code><strong><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1</code></strong>. When you multiply these together, NumPy \u201cbroadcasts\u201d all the size-1 dimensions to give a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">K\u00d7L\u00d7M\u00d7N</code> array. Then, the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">np.mean</code> calls average over the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">L</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">M</code> dimensions.</p>\n\n<p>I think this is bad. I\u2019ve been using NumPy for years and I still find it impossible to write code like that without <em>always</em> making mistakes.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s also borderline-impossible to read. To prove this, I just flipped a coin and introduced a bug above if and only if the coin was tails. Is there a bug? Are you <em>sure</em>? No one knows.</p>\n\n<p>Your second option is to desperately try to be clever. Life is short and precious, but if you spend a lot of yours reading the NumPy documentation, you might eventually realize that there\u2019s a function called <a href=\"https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.tensordot.html\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">np.tensordot</code></a>, and that it\u2019s possible to make it do much of the work:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">D</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"n\">L</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">mean</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n                <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">tensordot</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">B</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">axes</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">])</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span>\n                <span class=\"n\">C</span><span class=\"p\">[:,:,</span><span class=\"bp\">None</span><span class=\"p\">],</span>\n            <span class=\"n\">axis</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>That\u2019s correct. (I promise.) But why does it work? What exactly is <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">np.tensordot</code> doing? If you saw that code in some other context, would you have the slightest idea what was happening?</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s how I\u2019d do it, if only I could use loops:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">D</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">zeros</span><span class=\"p\">((</span><span class=\"n\">K</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"n\">N</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>  \n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">k</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"nb\">range</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">K</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>  \n    <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"nb\">range</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">N</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>  \n        <span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">k</span><span class=\"p\">,:,:]</span>  \n        <span class=\"n\">b</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">B</span><span class=\"p\">[:,</span><span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>  \n        <span class=\"n\">c</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">C</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">k</span><span class=\"p\">,:]</span>  \n        <span class=\"k\">assert</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">shape</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">L</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"n\">M</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  \n        <span class=\"k\">assert</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">shape</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">L</span><span class=\"p\">,)</span>  \n        <span class=\"k\">assert</span> <span class=\"n\">c</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">shape</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">M</span><span class=\"p\">,)</span>  \n        <span class=\"n\">D</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">k</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">mean</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"p\">[:,</span><span class=\"bp\">None</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"n\">c</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"bp\">None</span><span class=\"p\">,:])</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>People who\u2019ve written too much NumPy may find that clunky. I suspect that\u2019s a wee bit of Stockholm Syndrome. But surely we can agree that it\u2019s <em>clear</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, things are often even worse. Say that <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">A</code> had shape <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">M\u00d7K\u00d7L</code> rather than <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">K\u00d7L\u00d7M</code>. With loops, no big deal. But NumPy requires you to write monstrosities like <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">A.transpose([1,2,0])</code>. Or should that be <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">A.transpose([2,0,1])</code>? What shapes do those produce? No one knows.</p>\n\n<p>Loops were better.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ok-i-lied\">OK I lied</h2>\n\n<p>There is a third option:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">D</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">L</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">M</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">einsum</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">'klm,ln,km-&gt;kn'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">B</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">C</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve never seen Einstein summation before, that might look terrifying.

Then, <a href=\"https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">np.einsum</code></a> multiplies together the corresponding elements of the inputs and sums over all indices that aren\u2019t in the output.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I think <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">np.einsum</code> is one of the rare parts of NumPy that\u2019s actually good. The strings are a bit tedious, but they\u2019re worth it, because the overall function is easy(ish) to understand, is completely explicit, and is quite general and powerful.</p>\n\n<p>Except, how does <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">np.einsum</code> achieve all this? It uses indices. Or, more precisely, it introduces a tiny <em>domain-specific language</em> based on indices. It doesn\u2019t suffer from NumPy\u2019s design flaws because it refuses to play by NumPy\u2019s normal rules.</p>\n\n<p>But <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">np.einsum</code> only does a few things. (<a href=\"https://github.com/arogozhnikov/einops\">Einops</a> does a few more.) What if you want to apply some other function over various dimensions of some arrays? There is no <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">np.linalg.einsolve</code>. And if you create your own function, there\u2019s <em>certainly</em> no \u201cEinstein\u201d version of <em>it</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I think <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">np.einsum</code>\u2019s goodness shows that NumPy went somewhere.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"intermission\">Intermission</h2>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.nga.gov/artworks/45858-burning-old-south-church-bath-maine\">painting</a> which feels analogous to our subject.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/numpy/burning.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"where-did-numpy-go-wrong\">Where did NumPy go wrong?</h2>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what I want from an array language.

I think NumPy doesn\u2019t achieve these because of its original sin: It took away indices and replaced them with broadcasting.

When you multiply them together, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">B</code> is \u201cbroadcast\u201d to the shape of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">A</code>, meaning the first column of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">A</code> is multiplied with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">B[0]=10</code> and the second is multiplied with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">B[1]=20</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In simple cases, this seems good. But I don\u2019t love it. One reason is that, as we saw above, you often have to do gross things to the dimensions to get them to line up.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason is that it isn\u2019t explicit or legible. Sometimes <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">A*B</code> multiplies element-by-element, and sometimes it does more complicated things. So every time you see <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">A*B</code>, you have to figure out which case in the <a href=\"https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html\">broadcasting conventions</a> is getting triggered.</p>\n\n<p>But the real problem with broadcasting is how it infects everything else. I\u2019ll explain below.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"i-dont-like-numpy-indexing\">I don\u2019t like NumPy indexing</h2>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a riddle. Take this code:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">A</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">ones</span><span class=\"p\">((</span><span class=\"mi\">10</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">20</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">30</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">40</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n<span class=\"n\">i</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">array</span><span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n<span class=\"n\">j</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">array</span><span class=\"p\">([[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">],[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">]])</span>\n<span class=\"n\">B</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"p\">[:,</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"n\">j</span><span class=\"p\">,:]</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>What shape does <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">B</code> have?</p>\n\n<p>It turns out the answer is <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">10\u00d72\u00d73\u00d740</code>. That\u2019s because the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">i</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">j</code> indices get broadcast to a shape of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">2\u00d73</code> and then something something mumble mumble mumble. Try to convince yourself it makes sense.</p>\n\n<p>Done? OK, now try these:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">C</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"p\">[:,:,</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"n\">j</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">D</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"p\">[:,</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">,:,</span><span class=\"n\">j</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">E</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"p\">[:,</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"mi\">4</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"n\">j</span><span class=\"p\">,:]</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>What shapes do these have?</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">C</code> is <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">10\u00d720\u00d72\u00d73</code>. This seems logical, given what happened with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">B</code> above.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>What about <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">D</code>? It is <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">2\u00d73\u00d710\u00d730</code>. Now, for some reason, the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">2</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">3</code> go at the beginning?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>And what about <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">E</code>? Well, \u201cslices\u201d in Python exclude the endpoint, so <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1:4</code> is equivalent to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">[1,2,3]</code> which is equivalent to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">i</code>, and so <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">E</code> is the same as <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">B</code>. Hahaha, just kidding! <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">E</code> is <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">10\u00d73\u00d72\u00d71\u00d740</code>.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Yes, that is what happens. Try it if you don\u2019t believe me! I understand why NumPy does this, because I\u2019ve absorbed <a href=\"https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.indexing.html\">this 5000 word document</a> that explains how NumPy indexing works. But I want that time back.</p>\n\n<details>\n  \nFor fun, I tried asking a bunch of AI models to figure out what shapes those arrays have. Here were the results:\n\n\n  <p>I used this query:</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Take this python code</p>\n\n    <p>A = np.ones((10,20,30,40))<br />\ni = np.array([1,2,3])<br />\nj = np.array([[0],[1]])<br />\nB = A[:,i,j,:]<br />\nC = A[:,:,i,j]<br />\nD = A[:,i,:,j]<br />\nE = A[:,1:4,j,:]</p>\n\n    <p>what shapes do B, C, D, and E have?</p>\n  </blockquote>\n\n  <p>Claude 3.7 used \u201cextended thinking\u201d.

It got everything right the first time, but when I tried it again, it somehow got <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">B</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">C</code>, and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">D</code> all wrong, but <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">E</code> right.)</p>\n\n<p>This is insane. Using basic features should not require solving crazy logic puzzles.</p>\n\n<p>You might think, \u201cOK, I\u2019ll just limit myself to indexing in simple ways.\u201d Sounds good, except sometimes you <em>need</em> advanced indexing. And even if you\u2019re doing something simple, you still need to be careful to avoid the crazy cases.</p>\n\n<p>This again makes everything non-legible. Even if you\u2019re just reading code that uses indexing in a simple way, how do you <em>know</em> it\u2019s simple? If you see <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">A[B,C]</code>, that could be doing almost anything. To understand it, you need to remember the shapes of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">A</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">B</code>, and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">C</code> and work through all the cases. And, of course, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">A</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">B</code>, and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">C</code> are often produced by <em>other</em> code, which you <em>also</em> need to think about\u2026</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"i-dont-like-numpy-functions\">I don\u2019t like NumPy functions</h2>\n\n<p>Why did NumPy end up with a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">np.linalg.solve(A,B)</code> function that\u2019s so confusing? I imagine they first made it work when <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">A</code> is a 2D array and and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">b</code> is a 1D or 2D array, just like the mathematical notation of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">A\u207b\u00b9b</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">A\u207b\u00b9B</code>.</p>\n\n<p>So far so good. But then someone probably came along with a 3D array.  If you could use loops, the solution would be \u201cuse the old function with loops\u201d. But you can\u2019t use loops. So there were basically three options:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>They could add some extra <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">axes</code> argument, so the user can specify which dimensions to operate over. Maybe you could write <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">solve(A,B,axes=[[1,2],1])</code>.</li>\n  <li>They could create different  functions with different names for different situations. Maybe <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">solve_matrix_vector</code> would do one thing, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">solve_tensor_matrix</code> would do another.</li>\n  <li>They could add a Convention: Some arbitrary choice for how <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">solve</code> will internally try to line up the dimensions. Then it\u2019s the user\u2019s problem to figure out and conform to those Conventions.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All these options are bad, because none of them can really cope with the fact that there are a combinatorial number of different cases. NumPy chose: All of them. Some functions have <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">axes</code> arguments. Some have different versions with different names. Some have Conventions. Some have Conventions <em>and</em> <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">axes</code> arguments. And some don\u2019t provide any vectorized version at all.</p>\n\n<p>But the <em>biggest</em> flaw of NumPy is this: Say you create a function that solves some problem with arrays of some given shape. Now, how do you apply it to particular dimensions of some larger arrays? The answer is: You re-write your function from scratch in a much more complex way. The basic principle of programming is abstraction\u2014solving simple problems and then using the solutions as building blocks for more complex problems. NumPy doesn\u2019t let you do that.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"attention-please\">Attention please</h2>\n\n<p>One last example to show you what I\u2019m talking about. Whenever I whine about NumPy, people always want to see an example with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_(machine_learning)\">self-attention</a>, the core trick behind modern language models. So fine. Here\u2019s an implementation, which I humbly suggest is better than all 227 versions I found when I searched for \u201cself-attention numpy\u201d:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python

I finally made it to the part on how fun and easy this all was.</p><p>Caplan&#8217;s main argument is:</p><ol><li><p>We spend much more time and effort on parenting than our parents and grandparents, because we think the extra effort will make our kids better, happier, and more successful.</p></li><li><p>But behavioral genetics finds that parenting doesn&#8217;t make much difference to later-life outcomes; it&#8217;s mostly either genes or <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/16/non-shared-environment-doesnt-just-mean-schools-and-peers/\">inscrutable random seeds plus noise</a>.</p></li><li><p>So you can relax. Don&#8217;t run yourself ragged rushing your kids to gymnastics classes they don&#8217;t even like.</p></li><li><p>If you ask parents whether they&#8217;re happy, you get different answers depending on what exact framing you use; it&#8217;s kind of a tossup. But people who understand and internalize the points above will have a better time than average. So for <em>them,</em> kids are probably a great bet.</p></li></ol><p>I buy the behavioral genetics. I buy the ambiguous happiness results. But how long do parents really spend on childcare, and how easily can those numbers be cut?</p><h3>How Long Do Parents Really Spend On Childcare?</h3><p>Caplan&#8217;s most striking statistic is that <em>fathers</em> now spend more time with their kids than <em>mothers</em> did in 1960 - not because gender roles have changed, but because both parents&#8217; workload has been growing in tandem.

(See table 9.)</p><p>Adults living in households with at least one child under age 13 spent an average of <strong>5.1</strong> hours per day providing <strong>secondary </strong>childcare - that is, they had at least one child in their care while doing activities other than primary childcare. Secondary childcare provided by adults living in households with children under age 13 was most commonly provided while doing leisure activities (1.9 hours) or household activities    (1.3 hours).</p></blockquote><p>This matches both sources pretty well, so we can consider the discrepancy solved.

How could this be?</p><p>Caplan treats this question in the genre of life advice - why not relax and spend less time parenting, like your grandparents did? But to me it feels more like ancient occult wisdom. If you heard that the people of 10,000 BC built vast crystal pyramids that channeled the music of the spheres into infinite free electricity, you wouldn&#8217;t think &#8220;Oh, nice, guess that gives me permission to relax and stop fretting so much about energy policy&#8221;. You would wonder how they accomplished this seemingly impossible feat!</p><p>Here&#8217;s Caplan&#8217;s explanation:</p><blockquote><p>When he was a boy, my dad rode his bike all over downtown Los Angeles.. My friends and I had more supervision, but our moms still got us out of their hair by ordering us to play outside until dinner. My mom kindly let me read in my room, but the philosophy was the same: Entertaining myself was my job, not hers. Today, I almost never see kids playing outside without a watchful parent.</p></blockquote><p>This seems basically right. I lived just close enough to the tail end of this period to recognize the phrase &#8220;Remember to be home by dinner!&#8221;</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb25814f-330f-40b9-b30e-08c48bf111d5_609x575.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"575\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb25814f-330f-40b9-b30e-08c48bf111d5_609x575.png\" width=\"609\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/v870vf/map_comparing_four_generations_of_kids_how_far/\">This map</a> has radicalized lots of people on restoring children&#8217;s &#8220;right to roam&#8221;.

Chesterton <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/25/book-review-whats-wrong-with-the-world/\">wrote about</a> the phrase &#8220;you can&#8217;t turn back the clock&#8221;:</p><blockquote><p>There is one metaphor of which the moderns are very fond; they are always saying, &#8220;You can&#8217;t put the clock back.&#8221; The simple and obvious answer is &#8220;You can.&#8221; A clock, being a piece of human construction, can be restored by the human finger to any figure or hour. In the same way society, being a piece of human construction, can be reconstructed upon any plan that has ever existed. </p><p>There is another proverb, &#8220;As you have made your bed, so you must lie on it&#8221;; which again is simply a lie. If I have made my bed uncomfortable, please God I will make it again. We could restore the Heptarchy or the stage coaches if we chose. It might take some time to do, and it might be very inadvisable to do it, but certainly it is not impossible as bringing back last Friday is impossible. This is, as I say, the first freedom that I claim: the freedom to restore.</p></blockquote><p>So - could you, today, kick your child out the door at 9 AM on a Saturday and tell them to be back by dinner?</p><p>Bryan worries that most parents refuse to do this because they think the world is less safe than in their parents&#8217; and grandparents&#8217; generation. He says that&#8217;s wrong.  Modern death rates for children are a quarter what they were in the golden age of outside kids. Most of the improvement comes from less disease, which is only slightly relevant to this question. But deaths from accidents (including car accidents) are down even more (5x!). Deaths from homicide are up slightly, but realistically it doesn&#8217;t matter given how rare homicides were to begin with (and most child homicide victims are unfortunately killed by family members).</p><p>You could think of this improvement in two ways - either as proof that coddling kids works really well, or that coddling kids is unnecessary. Caplan chooses the latter, at great length - although when I read the several pages he devoted to this question I cannot figure out his exact argument disproving the former. </p><p>One potential argument is that the child trends mostly mirror adult trends. Adult accident death rates have also gone way down (and adult murder rates stayed about the same) since the 1960s. The simplest explanation is that child trends simply mirror adults. And the adult trend certainly isn&#8217;t caused by coddling. So maybe the kids aren&#8217;t either.</p><p>What about kidnapping? Plenty of people are kidnapped, but it&#8217;s usually something like a relative stealing them away in defiance of a divorce custody agreement. The &#8220;traditional kidnapping&#8221; where a creep in a white van plucks a child off the streets is much rarer - only about <a href=\"https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/child-abductions-strangers-moreau-kidnap-rare-18404760.php\">100 such incidents</a> come to the attention of the authorities per year. Even if the true number is 10x higher (is this is a reasonable multiplier?) that&#8217;s still only 1/70,000 children per year. On the other hand, over ~ten years of relevant childhood (I&#8217;m assuming babies can&#8217;t get into white vans, and nobody wants to kidnap 17 year olds) that&#8217;s a 1/7,000 chance. And surely if you&#8217;re the only person still letting your kid play outside, your chances are worse than average. But if you&#8217;re an upper-class person in a good neighborhood, your chances get better than average again. Let&#8217;s estimate a 10x penalty for playing outside and a 2x bonus for not being a poor person in a ghetto. Now it seems like your total chance of child abduction per child-lifetime is 1/1,400. </p><p>But it seems like most abductions <a href=\"https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/child-abductions-strangers-moreau-kidnap-rare-18404760.php\">are navigated successfully</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Across the country, only 181 Amber Alerts were broadcast in 2022, including one in New York, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. In those cases, 180 children were recovered and only one was still missing as of March. Four of the children were killed.</p></blockquote><p>If 4/180 abducted children are killed (I don&#8217;t know if number of Amber Alerts is the right denominator), that&#8217;s a 1/63,000 chance of child death via abduction per child-lifetime. Seems not great but not like a deal-breaker.</p><p>So maybe the more relevant question is - if you decide you want to do this, is it even possible?</p><p>I live next to a rationalist group house with several kids. They tried letting their six-year old walk two blocks home from school in the afternoon. After a few weeks of this, a police officer picked up the kid, brought her home, and warned the parents not to do this.</p><p>The police officer was legally in the wrong. <a href=\"https://www.cacilawyer.com/free-range-parenting-is-not-child-neglect.html\">This California child abuse lawyer</a> says that there are no laws against letting your kid play (or walk) outside unsupervised. There is a generic law saying children generally need &#8220;adequate&#8221; supervision, but he doesn&#8217;t think the courts would interpret this as banning the sort of thing my friends did.</p><p>Still, being technically correct is cold comfort when the police disagree. Even if you can eventually win a court case, that takes a lot of resources - and who&#8217;s to say a different cop won&#8217;t nab you next time? To solve the problem, seven states (not including California) <a href=\"https://fox59.com/business/press-releases/ein-presswire/642063258/in-seven-states-parents-can-now-legally-let-their-kids-play-outside/\">have passed &#8220;reasonable childhood independence&#8221; laws</a>, which make it clear to policemen and everyone else that unsupervised play is okay. There is a whole &#8220;free range kids&#8221; movement (its founder, Lenore Skenazy, gets profiled in SRTHMK) trying to win this legal and cultural battle.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.freerangekids.com/\">Free Range Kids website</a> has some tools and tips, but they don&#8217;t go about it the exact way that I would (yes, I&#8217;ve thought about this a lot). When Kai and Lyra are older, I fantasize about organizing the local rationalists - we have five families with kids on the same block. They&#8217;ll all wear bright orange t-shirts and hats with &#8220;FREE RANGE KIDS&#8221; on them, and they&#8217;ll all have a flyer - which they&#8217;re encouraged to show any adult or officer who complains - saying something like:</p><blockquote><p>Thank you for your concern about our child. We are part of the free-range kids movement; you can read more about it at letgrow.org. We&#8217;ve given our children permission to roam between XXth street and YYth street. This decision is protected under California law based on the arguments we list at whyfreerangekidsarelegal.com. This has been endorsed by such-and-such a lawyer, and we also talked it over with our local city council member, so-and-so, who agreed. If you see our kid doing a specific dangerous thing, or inconveniencing anyone else, please call us at XXX-XXXX and we&#8217;ll come over immediately. Otherwise, please let them be!</p><p>Thank you, <br />Your Neighbors<br /><br />PS: We are rich and extremely litigious.</p></blockquote><p>Eventually the kids in the bright orange shirts will become a local fixture among neighbors and cops alike, and people will stop bothering us. I have no idea if this will work, but it works in my head.</p><p>Still, age one is too early to try this; my kids would still run into the street if we weren&#8217;t there to stop them. Did the mothers of the 1950s have some other trick for spending less time with their one-year-olds?

They&#8217;ll use screens.</p><p>Caplan seems to mostly accept this fate:</p><blockquote><p>[These] suspicions are almost certainly correct. If you give mature adults extra free time, many relax in front of the TV or computer. It would be amazing if childish children didn&#8217;t do the same. But what&#8217;s wrong with that? Electronic babysitters are a vital component of cultural literacy. I hope my kids grow up to know both <em>The Simpsons</em> and Shakespeare. In any case, electronic babysitters are undeniably a lot of fun for kids, and - as a cheap, dependable substitute for a human babysitter - a blessing for parents, too. So why the hostility? It&#8217;s as if parents think that anything that feels good for every member of the family must be bad.</p><p>I&#8217;m not advising people to put their kids in front of the television and forget about them. My wife and I don&#8217;t let ours watch more than an hour or two a day, because we don&#8217;t want them to miss out on the other joys of childhood. I&#8217;m merely suggesting pragmatic adjustments in the way that families spend their time. If parents feel exhausted by their kids&#8217; busy schedule, they should trim a few hours of activity from their week - even if their kids spend most of their extra hours on TV and video games. The parents will be happier, and the kids will probably be happier too.</p></blockquote><p>Wise words - in 2011, when SRTHMK was written. What about the age of TikTok and Instagram?</p><p>We all know what argument comes next: &#8220;You think a newfangled thing is bad. But the ancients thought <em>their</em> newfangled thing was bad, and now that we&#8217;ve had time to get used to it, we realize it&#8217;s fine. Therefore, no new thing is ever bad.&#8221; People in 2000 were afraid video games were destroying society, people in 1960 were afraid TV was destroying society, people in 1600 thought the novel was destroying society, and people in 500 BC thought writing was destroying society. </p><p>Therefore, nothing can ever destroy society?

Every generation of Romans worried they were growing decadent and courting disaster. But eventually Rome did grow decadent and collapse. I&#8217;m not enough of a historian to know whether everyone was wrong until 476 AD and then they were right all at once - or whether each generation was right that they were slightly more decadent and less stable than the last, until finally the decline became unsustainable. But the guys in 475 saying &#8220;har har, we&#8217;ve read Livy, <em>he</em> thought <em>his generation</em> was decadent and about to collapse too&#8221; would have been in for a nasty surprise.

I was pretty young when I earned my PhD, so I&#8217;ve been a professor for a long time&#8212;over 30 years. If you&#8217;re not in academia, or it&#8217;s been awhile since you were in college, you might not know this: the students are not what they used to be. The problem with even talking about this topic at all is the knee-jerk response of, &#8220;yeah, just another old man complaining about the kids today, the same way everyone has since Gilgamesh. Shake your fist at the clouds, dude.&#8221;<a href=\"https://hilariusbookbinder.substack.com/p/the-average-college-student-today#footnote-1-159700143\">1</a> So yes, I&#8217;m ready to hear that. Go right ahead. Because people need to know [&#8230;]</p><p>Most of our students are functionally illiterate. This is not a joke. By &#8220;functionally illiterate&#8221; I mean &#8220;unable to read and comprehend adult novels by people like Barbara Kingsolver, Colson Whitehead, and Richard Powers.&#8221; I picked those three authors because they are all recent Pulitzer Prize winners, an objective standard of &#8220;serious adult novel.&#8221; Furthermore, I&#8217;ve read them all and can testify that they are brilliant, captivating writers; we&#8217;re not talking about <em>Finnegans Wake</em> here. But at the same time they aren&#8217;t YA, romantasy, or Harry Potter either [&#8230;]</p><p>Things have changed. Ted Gioia <a href=\"https://www.honest-broker.com/p/whats-happening-to-students\">describes</a> modern students as checked-out, phone-addicted zombies. Troy Jollimore <a href=\"https://thewalrus.ca/i-used-to-teach-students-now-i-catch-chatgpt-cheats\">writes</a>, &#8220;I once believed my students and I were in this together, engaged in a shared intellectual pursuit. That faith has been obliterated over the past few semesters.&#8221; Faculty have seen a <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/a-stunning-level-of-student-disconnection\">stunning level of disconnection</a> [&#8230;[ it is getting harder and harder and we don&#8217;t know what to do.</p></blockquote><p>If I&#8217;d known I was going to write this post, I would have saved the dozens of similar claims I&#8217;ve come across recently - as it is, I&#8217;ll just have to hope that you&#8217;ve seen them too.</p><p>Hilarius lists seven causes, which separate into three groups. </p><p>The first root cause group is COVID. Faculty lowered standards when things were genuinely tough. Then students pushed back when they tried to raise standards again, so the new low standards got locked in.</p><p>The second is general technology. Teachers started giving lectures on PowerPoint; they sent out the slides afterwards to help people study; students figured they could skip the lectures and read the slides instead. There are plenty of ways to use technology to get learning experiences which are easier than the real thing and 80% as good. But when you get too reliant on them, you learn 20% less.</p><p>But the third is screens. Bookbinder writes:</p><blockquote><p>[Students are] pretending to type notes in their laptops. I hate laptops in class, but if I try to ban them the students will just run to Accommodative Services and get them to tell me that the student <em>must</em> use a laptop or they will explode into tiny pieces. But I know for a fact that note-taking is at best a small part of what they are doing. Last semester I had a good student tell me, &#8220;hey you know that kid who sits in front of me with the laptop? Yeah, I thought you should know that all he does in class is gamble on his computer.&#8221; Gambling, looking at the socials, whatever, they are not listening to me or participating in discussion. They are staring at a screen.</p></blockquote><p>Maybe this is a subspecies of the previous category: bringing a laptop to class makes lectures far more tolerable at the cost of learning 20% less material. But also:</p><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://magdalene.substack.com/p/its-obviously-the-phones\">It&#8217;s the phones, stupid</a>. They are absolutely addicted to their phones. When I go work out at the Campus Rec Center, easily half of the students there are just sitting on the machines scrolling on their phones. I was talking with a retired faculty member at the Rec this morning who works out all the time. He said he has done six sets waiting for a student to put down their phone and get off the machine he wanted. The students can&#8217;t get off their phones for an hour to do a voluntary activity they chose for fun. Sometimes I&#8217;m amazed they ever leave their <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=goon\">goon caves</a> at all.</p></blockquote><p>Suppose that screens genuinely harm many students. Does that mean that parents should keep screens away from toddlers? It depends on the mechanism of harm. If phones harm kids by gradually damaging their brains somehow (chronic dopamine poisoning? I&#8217;m pretty sure this isn&#8217;t a real thing, but I&#8217;m sure some self-help guru has an infomercial that disagrees), and this damage is worst during childhood, then sure, keep your kids away. But if phones are merely very addictive - so addictive that college students scroll through social media instead of going to class - then it&#8217;s less obvious that it matters. You can&#8217;t realistically prevent your teenager from using a phone during college; if she has addictive tendencies, she&#8217;s going to get addicted. So why not save yourself some babysitting time when she&#8217;s three years old by letting her go on Toddler Instagram?</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd907d18-d286-4855-99e7-fef0c5444c69_601x665.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"461.40599001663895\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd907d18-d286-4855-99e7-fef0c5444c69_601x665.png\" width=\"417\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">My daughter would absolutely <em>dominate</em> Toddler Instagram.

Do Caplan&#8217;s exhortations to remember the behavioral genetics literature apply here? Will those with phone addiction genes get addicted no matter how we raise them? Only <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/abs/heritability-of-alcohol-use-disorders-a-metaanalysis-of-twin-and-adoption-studies/37CACC30305F59E2522864E2FD9CA272\">10%</a> of variability in alcohol addiction is shared environmental (eg potentially due to parenting); should this also be our estimate for phone addiction?</p><p>I feel about 75% sure there&#8217;s a trend towards recent intellectual decline which needs to be explained, I think phones are about 60% of the explanation, and I think it&#8217;s about 25% likely that early childhood phone use causes some damage beyond what would happen if you kept your kid away from phones until age 18 but then let him use them normally afterwards. When I multiply those all out, that&#8217;s an 11% chance that letting my kid use a phone will rot his brain. I can already hear Bryan Caplan saying that&#8217;s not so high - that living with a stressed-out parent who constantly resents the demandingness of childcare has a much more than 11% chance of being bad.</p><p>But it&#8217;s not just addiction. What if they wander into the wrong part of the Internet and become incels, or SJWs with seven genders, or sedevacantists? Lots of people get one or another mind virus; why should my kids be immune? Because I&#8217;ll give them a happy childhood? I checked this on the ACX survey, and although alt-rightists did have significantly less happy childhoods than normal liberals (5.93 vs. 6.70 on a ten-point scale), the effect was too weak to rely on on an individual level (46% of alt-rightists had happier childhoods than the average liberal). Also, I married the only centrist-classical-liberal woman left in the San Francisco Bay Area - what kind of off-the-chart-outlier genes did she need in order to pull that off? If my son inherits those genes in a male body and moves to Chicago or something, will he become the next Costin Alamariu? And what about our daughter? What percent of women from intellectually-inclined non-practicing-Jewish families avoid becoming insane woke people? 20%? 10%? Sure, we&#8217;ll try to inculcate her into our reasonable liberal culture. But what do you think all those woke teenagers are rebelling against?</p><p>Can a 2011 book say anything about these dangers? Caplan still blogs; some of his more recent output addresses them more directly. But maybe his greater contribution is the way SRTHMK teaches us to challenge our fears. Are the dangers of today really worse than those of yesterday? Is some real-but-small chance of harm from insufficient caution really worse than the certainty of making ourselves and our kids miserable through excessive discipline? Can we really win a fight against the spirit of the age and our children&#8217;s genetic proclivities?</p><p>When I try to apply SRTHMK&#8217;s lessons, I can&#8217;t deny that I&#8217;m being exactly the kind of hypocrite who says that <em>my</em> generation was okay but <em>the next</em> generation is destroying society. I chafed against all of my parents&#8217; stupid computer use restrictions as a teenager - why couldn&#8217;t they understand that I was only playing <em>classy</em> games, like <em>Civilization</em>, and hanging out on <em>decent </em>sites, like LiveJournal? Now it&#8217;s twenty years later and&#8230; </p><p>&#8230;actually, I guess I became an anti-woke influencer (surely every good liberal mother&#8217;s worst nightmare). And I did sort of join a doomsday cult (comparatively tame but still unfortunate). Is that bad enough that my parents were right? If my kids end up as weird compared to me as I am compared to my parents, will I tolerate them as graciously as my parents still somehow tolerate me?</p><p>At this age, none of this affects me as much as my visceral reaction when I see a phone-addicted toddler. I shudder to see a three-year-old in the grocery store screaming &#8220;PHONE? PHONE?&#8221; until her parents relent and let her watch algorithmically-recommended YouTube videos of dancing monsters. And I <em>know</em> my kids would fall for it. I got them a toy keyboard-like-object once, the kind where you press a button and it plays terrible nursery rhymes. Sometimes I would not want to hear terrible nursery rhymes and would turn it off. Big mistake. My son would scream at me until I changed my mind; eventually I stopped even trying. The moment he gets a phone, his life is over.</p><p>And this is part of a more general argument against superstimuli. I used to let my kids stand on top of the table, under supervision. They loved it. Every time they saw me, they would grab me and point to the table. But sometimes I didn&#8217;t want to supervise them that closely, or there were breakable objects on the table, and then they (okay, mostly my son) would throw tantrums. Eventually my wife made a no-tables rule so they would lose the expectation that pestering us might work. This has expanded into a broader principle: don&#8217;t let toddlers know a superstimulus exists if you&#8217;re not prepared to fight them about whether they get to have it all the time.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c4450c3-1b3e-41cc-9393-84dd321ad7b8_648x488.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"430.7654320987654\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c4450c3-1b3e-41cc-9393-84dd321ad7b8_648x488.png\" width=\"572\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Under the table is fine, I guess.</figcaption></figure></div><p>So I&#8217;m not giving in yet. If nothing else, I want to be able to spend quality time with my kids without it turning into an argument over whether they get the phone or not.</p><h3>Selfish Reasons To Do Less Childcare</h3><p>None of this addresses my primary interest in this book: am I wrong to feel overwhelmed by childcare? </p><p>I was curious enough about this that I emailed Bryan and asked him how much time he spent on childcare when his kids were toddlers. He said about two hours a day for him, one hour for his wife. Relatives and nannies picked up the rest.</p><p>I could complain that sure, childcare isn&#8217;t overwhelming when you&#8217;re only doing two hours of it a day. But honestly, this is about the same amount of childcare I do now. And I <em>do</em> feel overwhelmed. So advantage Bryan.</p><p>When I thought about it more, I realized a lot of my overwhelmedness came from not being able to consistently choose the two hours, and from survivor&#8217;s guilt about my wife doing her 7-8 hours. When I talked more with Bryan, he recommended hiring more nannies.</p><p>(Daycare would also work, except that my wife and nanny both have terrible immune systems and get knocked out of commission if they catch anything from the kids. Any solution which exposes them to more germs probably saves me <em>negative</em> childcare hours.)</p><p>I&#8217;d been resisting this. Partly it was out of stinginess - something something tariffs, something something impending recession. But partly it was pride. We&#8217;re a two parent family with a stay-at-home mom, a work-from-home dad, and a part-time nanny. Millions have it far worse.</p><p>I read SRTHMK hoping it would have some loophole, One Weird Trick that would let me stop feeling overwhelmed and join the ranks of those pronatalist influencers who blog about how childcare is great and you should go ahead and have kids right now, even if you&#8217;re only twenty-five, even if you don&#8217;t have your career totally figured out, even if you lost all your limbs in a tragic boating accident and are incapable of independent movement. It doesn&#8217;t, at least not for one-year-olds.</p><p>Instead it had a vibe: stop beating yourself up over your parenting decisions. So I put out a classified ad for babysitters and got two people I really like. Things are a little better now. I can even write research-filled book reviews again! </p><p>This whole time I was reading <em>Selfish Reasons To Have More Kids</em>, when I should have been waiting for <em>Pro-Market And Pro-Business </em>(released last month, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Market-Pro-Business-Laissez-Faire-Bryan-Caplan/dp/B0F53HMNZN?crid=J2Q2KZNUX1GZ&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Db7J-LYBb5rGb7HAe40QCJaCFCN1RP_569qpS6Xft_0H3gpI-mg-cefNFwXXttQHQkRQjRfJHt8fSQl9TfeI7jUMEajgHjZvrRKwEIbZoLo3CsYKAR1srrwLHlIirUxOraNeNtKU3rgkbRS5yfpymVKzsjeb39lj1KIeulrBB8mimzNGiZQ-JALJDdA3vDwjYgd2tFbC_JhEwG_XRWtXokmrb9ypH36TAwPeAEMbdwQ.JZQfQJT9oikOTpH5EWTIogWtmNSHMeMh5sytniE5Mg0&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=pro-market+and+pro-business&amp;qid=1747311695&amp;sprefix=pro-market+and+pro-busines%2Caps%2C206&amp;sr=8-1\">now available on Amazon</a>)<em>. </em>There really is a Bryan Caplan book for everything!</p>"
