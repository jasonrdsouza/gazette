With a combination of two drugs administered once every six months, it might be mostly defeated.</p>\n<p>Just think about that how big this is! You will know your great-grandkids!</p>\n<p>It is insanely optimistic that we have drugs that can reduce Lp(a) levels by [65%-]98% in trials right now.</p>\n<p>If they succeed, they could help to crush heart disease and stroke.</p>\n<p>Unlike LDL in general, Lp(a) levels are basically entirely genetic in origin and not open to lifestyle intervention. It is also widely accepted that the race differences are down to genes.</p>\n<p>These drugs are examples of genetic discovery leading to a group difference fix via tech.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01308-4/abstract\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The future of medicine is still very bright</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I wouldn\u2019t go that far. Even if these trials are successful, it seems unlikely we\u2019re talking about \u2018mostly defeat,\u2019 although we could plausibly be at \u2018greatly reduce.\u2019 Which could still be worth several years of life expectancy across the board. If we could also similarly help with other major causes of death and aging, you\u2019d see compounding gains, but without that aging still catches up with everyone.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, America under the current administration is making deep cuts in basic research funding that leads to advances like this. Hopefully AI can make up for that.</p>\n<h4>Alcohol</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/health/460086/rfk-jr-trump-maha-cancer-alcohol-study-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">A new major study finds that alcohol causes cancer</a>, so government worked to bury the study. Time and time again we get presented with the fact that small amounts of drinking correlate with improved health in various ways, fooling many into thinking a little alcohol is healthy.</p>\n<p>As opposed to the reality, which is that alcohol is bad for you no matter what, but that inability to drink is highly correlated with alcoholism and other traits that go along with poor health, whereas ability to drink only in moderation is a good sign.</p>\n<p>So drinking in moderation, which is only a small amount bad for your health, is still a good sign for your health if you are drinking in moderation. Whereas heavier drinking consistently looks bad, perhaps even worse than it is.</p>\n<p>Trump himself is not fooled, and does not drink at all, as he has seen the dangers of alcoholism in his own family. A wise choice.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dylan Scott: They broke out their findings by different drinking levels \u2014 from one drink per day to three \u2014 and focused on health outcomes that have been proven to be associated with alcohol use. Their big-picture conclusion:</p>\n<p>Among the US population, the negative health effects of drinking alcohol start at low levels of consumption and begin to increase sharply the more a person drinks. A man drinking one drink per day has roughly a one in 1,000 chance of dying from any alcohol-related cause, whether an alcohol-associated cancer or liver disease or a drunk driving accident. Increase that to two drinks per day, and the odds increase to one in 25.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>In that context, the report is a harrowing read: Alcohol use is associated with increased mortality for seven types of cancer \u2014 colorectal, breast cancer in women, liver, oral, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus. Risk for these cancers increases with any alcohol use and continues to grow with higher levels of use, the study\u2019s authors concluded.</p>\n<p>Women experience a higher risk of an alcohol-attributable cancer per drink consumed than men. Men and women who die from an alcohol-attributable cause die 15 years earlier on average.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A 4% chance of dying on average 15 years earlier is a big deal.</p>\n<p>This is not the first time a Trump administration defied the data on this.</p>\n<blockquote><p>US officials always solicit expert opinion as they prepare a fresh set of dietary guidelines. The input is usually compiled into one massive report from a group of experts called the US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee and then submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture, the two agencies that produce the guidelines.</p>\n<p>That was how the process went in 2020, and at that time, the subcommittee of researchers dedicated to alcohol (including Naimi) advised the government to reduce the recommended limit down to <a href=\"https://archive.is/o/DDkDc/https://www.wsj.com/articles/men-urged-to-limit-alcohol-to-one-drink-a-day-amid-new-concerns-11597688916\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">one drink per day for men</a>, from two. The Trump administration ultimately <a href=\"https://archive.is/o/DDkDc/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/health/dietary-guidelines-alcohol-sugar.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">decided not to follow the recommendation</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Legal Reforms</h4>\n<p>Montana passes SB 535 with broad bipartisan backing, further expands its \u2018right to try\u2019 rules, <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/05/montana-bucks-the-fda-establishes-biotech-and-longevity-hub.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=montana-bucks-the-fda-establishes-biotech-and-longevity-hub\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">with a license path for experimental treatment centers to administer any drug that got through Phase I trials</a>, to anyone who wants it. This is The Way.</p>\n<p>Alex Tabarrok is correct that <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/08/free-the-patient-a-competitive-federalism-fix-for-telemedicine.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=free-the-patient-a-competitive-federalism-fix-for-telemedicine\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">we could greatly improve healthcare if we allowed telemedicine across state lines</a>. As long as a doctor is licensed where the doctor is physically located, it shouldn\u2019t matter where the patient is located. The best part is that <a href=\"https://x.com/Cotton_MT/status/1955782779616289050\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">this could be done with an admin rules change of two words</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alexkesin.com/p/mr-secretary-reclassify-the-statin?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=104087&amp;post_id=163639638&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=3o9&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">A call to make statins be sold over the counter (OTC)</a>. This seems obviously correct, even if you are highly skeptical that the correlations cited here imply causation, or that they imply that intervening via statin cause this causation without important side effects. That\u2019s a decision people can make for themselves at this point. But then a whole host of things should be OTC at this point that aren\u2019t.</p>\n<h4>Embryo Selection and Gene Editing</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://t.co/CW2McjqY3p\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">A new embryo selection company, Herasight</a> has launched <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1950590708647178518\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">that is allowing users to select for IQ</a>. They claim that with as few as 10 embryos you can already go from an expected IQ of 100 to a new average of 107. Or you can do things like go from 45% chance of Type 2 Diabetes to 25%.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Alex Young: I\u2019ve been working with an IVF startup, @herasight, that has already screened hundreds of embryos. Today we come out of stealth with a paper showing that our predictors for 17 diseases \u2014 validated within-family \u2014 beat the competition, with improved performance in non-Europeans.</p>\n<p>In our paper, we detail our polygenic scores (PGS) for 17 diseases using a custom meta-analysis. We used state-of-the-art methods to create PGSs based on 7.3M SNPs. Our most predictive PGSs explained ~20% of the variance in liability for prostate cancer and type-II diabetes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In practice what happens is you get your 5, 10 or 20 embryos, they profile each one, and you are choosing based on a variety of traits. What do you actually care about most? You are about to find out.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/kitten_beloved/status/1950654502396477929\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Kitten:</a> Within a few years they&#8217;re going to be able to show you a very accurate picture of what each baby will look like as an adult.</p>\n<p>That will trump every other consideration by a large margin.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I agree that this technology is coming. I agree it will matter to people. And why shouldn\u2019t it matter, at least from a selfish point of view? It also might be a better way to select for other good things than you might think, as in general health and other positive traits are correlated with beauty. I do not think it will be anything like \u2018this overrides everything else.\u2019</p>\n<p>Even the graceful failure mode for things like this is a really big deal.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/webdevMason/status/1950656906445705219\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Mason</a>: I think this just ignores the realities of IVF tbh</p>\n<p>20 healthy embryos is, for most people, 3-5 IVF cycles</p>\n<p>Success for a single embryo transfer is 40-60%.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Well, your dad and I wanted a boy and you were the second highest IQ male after Embryo 6 failed to implant.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Yeah, these numbers are for mothers &lt;35. It&#8217;s crazy how many people think IVF is a safety net for aging out of your fertility window when you actually need to start the process quite young in order for it to be likely to work.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I mean that sounds pretty great? You got your choice of gender and a couple of IQ points, while presumably also dodging a variety of potential genetic disorders. That\u2019s a pretty good haul.</p>\n<p>What you actually get is not maximizing on one to two traits, although you do have that option. What you get is to do a general maximization over many traits. That is a lot more valuable if you are making reasonable decisions.</p>\n<p>Mason is however making the very important point that if you want to use IVF and have confidence it will work at all, let alone confidence it will give you selection, you need to do it early. The younger you are, the better all of this will on average go, until such time as we figure out how to generate new eggs (which is plausibly only a few years away).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/GeneSmi96946389/status/1951417531547496860\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">As Gene Smith points out in this thread, academics are super against all of this.</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>Gene Smith: We&#8217;re in this insane world right now where rich parents are going through IVF just to do embryo selection, and middle class parents who are ALREADY doing IVF are being told by doctors that embryo selection doesn&#8217;t work or is unethical.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been to conferences on embryo selection or ones where the topic is discussed, you will realize the truth is basically the opposite. Most academic discussion of this is dominated by ethicists talking about how problematic it is or academics talking about its limitations.</p>\n<p>And make no mistake, these discussions matter. They&#8217;re the main reason why even doctors who understand embryo selection rarely recommend it to their patients, even when it could significantly reduce the odds of a patient passing along a disease to their child.</p>\n<p>Among the academics that care about this, a large majority are opposed to embryo selection for ideological reasons. There hasn&#8217;t been all that much quantitative analysis done on it. And what has been done often fails to capture how embryo selection is actually done in industry.</p>\n<p>A lot of work has focused on selection on a single trait, which is easier to model, but not how selection actually works in practice. And many of the conclusions about its efficacy rely on outdated predictors which have improved substantially since publication.</p>\n<p>The effect size of embryo selection for IQ <a href=\"https://t.co/e4o1BbsxdN\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">has nearly tripled since the publication of this paper</a>, which was still being cited relatively recently.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He also reminds us that we are spending all our gene editing resources on rare diseases where we can stick the government gigantic bills and the \u2018ethicists\u2019 stop trying to ban you from helping, whereas the places where most of the value lies are complete ignored, even by people who would directly benefit.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/GeneSmi96946389/status/1955184499509314002\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Gene Smith</a>: The situation in the gene editing field right now is kind of unbelievable. We&#8217;ve spent over a decade throwing billions of dollars at the gene editing for rare diseases and we still can&#8217;t get the editors inside most of the cell types we need to modify.</p>\n<p>Everything is either for the liver or the eye or the bone marrow. We can&#8217;t get to the brain. We can&#8217;t get to the lungs. We can&#8217;t get to the heart. And we can barely fit a single editor into the best delivery vector so no one is even thinking about polygenic disease.</p>\n<p>There is an extremely simple way to fix this: edit in embryos. All the stuff we can&#8217;t target right now because of delivery issues becomes almost trivial in embryos. You can literally stick a needle into the egg and squirt the editors in.</p>\n<p>Alzheimer&#8217;s? Tractable. Diabetes? You can pretty much get rid of it. Heart disease? You can mostly make it a thing of the past. Breast cancer? Same deal.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>The blame for this delay lies at the feet of academics. There are literally professors who go to conferences on gene editing and brag about how they&#8217;ve gotten governments to ban embryo gene editing.</p>\n<p>[thread continues]</p>\n<p>Bex: surely this is being done black budget and for the uber wealthy already. but I guess all that learning is hidden:(</p>\n<p>Gene Smith: As someone working on the cutting edge of this field, I can tell you it&#8217;s definitely NOT. You underestimate how maddeningly myopic wealthy people can be about new tech. Fred Koch literally didn&#8217;t ask the cancer research center he funded to look into ways to treat his cancer.</p>\n<p>The most cutting edge thing wealthy people are actually doing right now is embryo selection a la Herasight and Orchid.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I mean, it\u2019s not that simple, of course it is not that simple, but it is a little bit that simple?</p>\n<p>If you have the option to use the technology we do have, it seems crazy not to use it. <a href=\"https://x.com/noor_siddiqui_/status/1956193329928134696\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Noor Siddiqui is being too righteous and superior about it even for me here</a>, but if it really does cost as little as $2,500 to get selection over potential embryos, that is a better deal than essentially any remotely optional interventions you have access to after birth. The replies to such proposals are full of people saying how horrible all this is and having instinctual disgust and purity reactions, and calling everyone involved and the proposal itself various names, all of it patently absurd without any actual justifications.</p>\n<p>I do strongly agree with Vitalik Buterin that while <a href=\"https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1957156680430715120\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">we should be very much in favor of embryo selection</a> and most of the attacks on it are deranged, it is counterproductive and wrong to strike back by saying that since it condemns your children to be worse off that not using selection is unethical.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1957156680430715120\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Vitalik Buterin</a>: If you publicly telegraph that if you win your fight for acceptance you will immediately follow it up with a fight for imposition, do not be surprised if people decide to oppose your fight for acceptance from day one with a vigor only reserved for resisting imposition.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We\u2019ve been over this one many times. If that which is not forbidden is compulsory, then that which I do not want to be compulsory must be forbidden.</p>\n<h4>GLP-1s Work</h4>\n<p>Oh no, all these GLP-1 drugs are going to prevent people from dying, <a href=\"https://x.com/peterwildeford/status/1905280400051798290\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">and that could have a negative impact on pensions</a>?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1905689757403021367\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Eliezer does a survey</a>, finds ~80% of those who tried GLP-1 drugs report it helped lots versus those that didn\u2019t, roughly confirming industry claims. That\u2019s a fantastic success rate.</p>\n<p>Now we are potentially seeing <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1912959600686465116\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Eli Lily have a pill that\u2019s ~55% as effective as Ozempic in phase-3 trials</a>, their stock was up 14% on the news. They also have Retatrutide coming in a year or two, which is claimed to be a more effective GLP-1 drug that also causes less muscle loss.</p>\n<p>These marginal improvements make a huge practical difference. GLP-1s are now a lot like AI, in that we keep getting better versions and people\u2019s impressions don\u2019t update.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/links-for-april-2025?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=89120&amp;post_id=161001546&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=67wny&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Unfortunately, it\u2019s not always easy to get a line on the necessary supply.</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>Scott Alexander: Update on <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-ozempocalypse-is-nigh\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ozempocalypse</a>: some pharmacies have stopped selling compounded GLP-1 drugs, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/21/zepbound-copycats-tirzepatide-compounding-online-fda-ban.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">others continue</a>, with various flimsy legal excuses.

Alas, there is now no longer an official shortage, so the price is shooting back up again (~$1k/month) and supply is harder to find.

The results were amazingly great, everything went smoothly. This is even more evidence for FDA Delenda Est, while noting that \u2018fire a bunch of people at the FDA\u2019 makes things worse rather than better.

You\u2019re asking it to give you the right highly calibrated signal in a radically different world than the one it was trained for.</p>\n<p>This doesn\u2019t require toxins or any particular villain beyond widespread variety and caloric availability, including many calorically dense foods, and greatly increased food variety and quality, and various cultural expectations of eating frequently. <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1858704235853979878\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">It is enough</a>, and regardless of the original cause life is not fair.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Cremieux: Attempts to explain the obesity epidemic through contamination, toxins, conspiracies, seed oils, sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, lithium, or whatever else always strike me as annoying.</p>\n<p>What we must explain is an increase of ~200-350 calories a day in energy balance. That&#8217;s all.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset\">\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KSVi!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdb04437-3063-4126-85c5-e8b3a1f0324a_1200x675.jpeg\" title=\"\" width=\"1200\" /></p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>My answer is simple, and similar to Cremieux\u2019s in the thread, that there was never really any robust natural \u2018balance.\u2019</p>\n<p>For full disclosure, I say this as someone whose satiety has always been utterly broken to the point of uselessness. If left to my own devices I would put on insane amounts of weight very quickly. I might double my caloric intake. That\u2019s what actually broken looks like. But don\u2019t ask an evolutionary mechanism to give the right answer in a radically changed world, and don\u2019t call it \u2018broken\u2019 when you have to adapt.</p>\n<p>Yes, until recently that meant you had to work for it. That\u2019s one option. The other? Good news, now we have Ozempic and other GLP-1s.</p>\n<h4>Supplements</h4>\n<blockquote><p>Key Smash Bandit: I started taking a million supplements and I do feel meaningfully better but the new problem is I have no idea which one did it, and taking all of them is expensive and annoying</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/moultano/status/1951333043613966839\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Ryan Moulton</a>: This is a fun task to try to design an experiment to resolve.</p>\n<p>I would randomize to taking 50% each day, (ideally blinded, but whatever) and then record how I felt each day. Then after you have ~a month of data, fit a regression model from what you took to how you felt, probably also with at least terms for 1 day lag. Lean on L1 in lasso a lot, because you&#8217;re probably looking for a single thing rather than a large set.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately there are what the economists call \u2018long and variable lags\u2019 in vitamin impact, both positive and negative. Even if it originally helped or hurt in a day, it might take a while for a supplement to wear off. Others only work via accumulation over time, or work on things other than observable mood.</p>\n<p>Experimental design here is very hard. I would not want to maximize purely on the basis of how I feel within 24 hours.</p>\n<p>Also, for various reasons, you cannot by default confidently equate any given pill with other pills from another source that claim to deliver the same dose of the same vitamin.</p>\n<p>If I was going to run such tests, as much I would like to randomize every day, I would at minimum want to wait three or so days between swaps, and I would limit the multiple hypothesis testing. The data is going to be super noisy at best.</p>\n<h4>A Cure For Some Depression</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/joshwhiton/status/1891488522542145548\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">A story worth sharing</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Josh Whiton: Halfway through university I was diagnosed with clinical depression. After a battery of tests and interviews with psychologists I eventually met with the psychiatrist who was to dispense my medication.</p>\n<p>Instead he asked me a question that no one had ever asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Why are you depressed?&#8221;</p>\n<p>So I told him about the meaninglessness of life in an accidental universe where all life was just the product of chance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You want me to put you on medication because you&#8217;re an intellectual?&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Then he said the wildest thing: &#8220;My concern is that your depression is part of a process and the drugs will slow it down.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He told me to go home and observe all the thoughts in my mind instead of trying to escape from them. If in three days I still wanted the drugs, to come back and he&#8217;d give them to me.</p>\n<p>So I went home and spent three days journaling, had three epiphanies about the nature of reality, and the year-long depression immediately lifted.</p>\n<p>I wonder about all the kids like me who got the drugs instead.</p></blockquote>\n<h4>Assisted Suicide</h4>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/zdch/status/1956771192406196362\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Zac Hill</a>: One of the things I was most brazenly wrong about was just basically making fun of people who thought that Canada\u2019s euthanasia program would achieve scale.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As in, MAID now is already 5% of all deaths in Canada and is about to be available for mental conditions and parliament wants to grant access to minors, and I see a bunch of claims about it being aggressively pushed onto people in various ways. One wonders where this stops, once it starts. If it stops.</p>\n<p>Former <a href=\"https://x.com/matthew_loftus/status/1924698070828089668\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Quebec officials suggest that best \u201csolution\u201d for intellectually disabled woman</a> without adequate support might be death. Which might be true, but wowie. This highlights where things might be going. Do you trust the state to not push such solutions on people who are financial burdens? To not cut off aid to them as part of an attempt to force such choices upon them? I notice my answer is very much no.</p>\n<h4>Bioethics Delenda Est</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/jpsenescence/status/1952862465517101150\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">A lot of \u2018ethics\u2019 people think the only ethical thing for you to do is hurry up and die.</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>Joao Pedro de Magalh\u00e3es: &#8220;It is highly unethical to stop aging&#8221; &#8211; reviewer commenting on one of my grant applications.</p>\n<p>The grant focused on cellular rejuvenation, no mention to curing aging, but it shows we still have a long way to go to convince even fellow scientists that curing aging is desirable.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As in, you are trying to solve people\u2019s health problems, but this might also cure aging, And That\u2019s Terrible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/dylanmatt/status/1897821508258419007\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Once again: Bioethicists know nothing of ethics.</a> This is them answering:</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset\">\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"325.25379170879677\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!pYa4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe49a4863-190a-44c8-bbc4-fa4086ea9686_989x548.jpeg\" title=\"\" width=\"587\" /></p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/wideawake_media/status/1899022626745409647\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Here\u2019s a bioethicist giving a Ted talk advocating that humans</a> be \u2018engineered\u2019 to be, no not more intelligent or healthy or happy but (checks notes) intolerant to meat, at the same time that other \u2018ethicists\u2019 are screaming about how awful it is we might do embryo selection on positive traits.</p>\n<p>And 41% stand ready here to outright deny physical reality.</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset\">\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8Kdk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc73eb99a-eaeb-4385-aa56-d31270e20b53_1998x862.jpeg\" title=\"\" width=\"1456\" /></p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>How exactly would we design society such that it is not a disadvantage to be blind?</p>\n<p>If I was blind and I heard people were claiming this, I\u2019d be pretty pissed off at them.</p>\n<p>Do you think, by answering that way, you are helping anyone?</p>\n<h4>Ignorance Can Be Bliss</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/robinhanson/status/1895260963496251671\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Learning about your HIV status, when treatment is not available</a>, dramatically reduces long term survival rates. Some of this is people adjusting rationally to the news, and engaging in generally riskier (to themselves) behaviors and having higher discount rates. Some of it is despair or overreaction. However it isn\u2019t really an option not to tell them or not run the tests, for obvious reasons.</p>\n<p>Here in New York they take every opportunity to push you to get tested for HIV, even when there is no reason to do that, as I found out on a recent hospital visit (it was an infection, I am 100% fine now, don\u2019t worry).</p>\n<h4>Living Forever In Your Apartment</h4>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/clashreport/status/1963210782247661642\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Clash Report</a>: Hot-mic moment at the Beijing parade.</p>\n<p>Xi: \u201cPeople rarely lived past 70 before.

It will not happen because \u2018organs can be replaced endlessly\u2019 because that does not reverse aging, so the rate of new problems will keep doubling roughly every seven years, but we have other options.</p>\n<p>Also, yeah, thinking \u2018at 70 you\u2019re still a child\u2019 is both obviously false and reflective of the geriatric ruling class that is doing so much damage.
