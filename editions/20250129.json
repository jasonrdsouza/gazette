Ironically, I am God&#8217;s least favorite soldier when it comes to matters of the heart. I&#8217;ve spent most of my young adult and adult-adult life hopping from one relationship to another. I never sought out love. It always found me, and, usually, I was the one who left first.</strong></p><p><strong>But even before that, I remember myself as this wildly enthusiastic kid who dreamed of growing up quickly, of becoming an independent adult. My mom recently found my first-grade coursework, which included a letter I wrote to my future self at six years old. In my own words, I wrote, \"I can't wait to grow up and get a jop!!!\" Spelling may not have been my forte back then, but I was full of big dreams and unshakable determination, Polly. Then came my teenage years, when my interests drifted from the concrete jungle of career ambition to fairytales filled with cheesy, choreographed dance sequences and cloying notions of true love. This wasn&#8217;t random. It was the product of inconsistent parenting and an unhealthy exposure to Bollywood movies that I think rewired my brain in all the wrong ways.</strong></p><p><strong>When I was broken up with for the first time &#8212; at 24, after a toxic relationship &#8212; I hit rock bottom. The life I had dreamed of with that particular garbage can of a man blew up overnight. For the first time, I was forced to look at myself, and I barely recognized what I saw. I had diluted myself into an amalgamation of the people I had dated &#8212; their dreams, their goals, their ambition. I was a husk of a person, Polly, with barely any individuality.</strong></p><p><strong>It&#8217;s not like I gave myself away completely. Even in that last relationship, I was juggling undergrad and two jobs. I&#8217;ve always been kinetic, incapable of sitting idly, but all my energy was being consumed by satisfying the needs of a narcissistic man. That emotionally manipulative relationship drained me of my confidence, and when it ended, I felt like I had nothing left. It was the worst moment of my life, and I knew I had to change stat if I wanted a good one. Cue &#8220;She&#8217;s All That&#8221; makeover montage: I rebuilt myself from scratch.</strong></p><p><strong>Two years later, I&#8217;m a different person. I have a postgraduate degree from one of the top universities in the country, I made the Dean&#8217;s Honor List, and I work as a consultant at a Fortune 500 company. I am absolutely incredible at my job, I make good money, and my career prospects look amazing. But more importantly, I&#8217;ve been single for two whole years, a first for me. I realized that my endless need for a partner was born out of a hatred for being alone, of sitting with my own thoughts. But over the past two years, I&#8217;ve sorted myself out. I&#8217;ve undone 25 years of toxic thinking, something even years of therapy couldn&#8217;t manage. I invited the voices in my head to sit with me, and, believe it or not, we&#8217;ve become friends now. I&#8217;ve also started writing again, which helps me see things more clearly. Now, I&#8217;m much more committed to what I set out to do and can&#8217;t stand complacency at all. It&#8217;s made me impatient with people who approach life half-heartedly.</strong></p><p><strong>For the first time in my life, I&#8217;m proud of who I&#8217;ve become. I&#8217;m the person who gives pep talks now. I&#8217;m the most accomplished person in my family. And yet&#8230; love has found its way back into my life, and I&#8217;m terrified it will dilute me again. I don&#8217;t want to lose myself, but I find myself awake at 5 a.m. saying a plethora of cringy, mind-rotting things to a man when I have to be at work in a few hours. The giddy schoolgirl is back, and she&#8217;s demanding to be consumed by love, demolishing the hard, unshakeable demeanor I&#8217;ve spent two years building. I won&#8217;t lie, Polly &#8212; it feels amazing! Being in love feels amazing!!! I feel like a junkie who&#8217;s finally had the good stuff after years of being clean.</strong></p><p><strong>In the past two years, I shoved aside all the ridiculous ideas of love to focus on my ambition. It&#8217;s the best thing I&#8217;ve ever done for myself, but it was also lonely &#8212; a long, hard, lonely struggle. I had made peace with the idea that love might destroy me or my ambition because the symptoms often feel the same. I forget to eat and sleep for days; I feel the same butterflies from getting a good evaluation at work as I do from a man showing up at my door with flowers. The truth is, for as long as I can remember, I have always been this all-gas-no-brakes person. I like being consumed by whatever I do. I&#8217;ve never been able to like anything &#8212; or anyone &#8212; a casual amount, and I am afraid I never will.</strong></p><p><strong>This new man&#8230; he&#8217;s different. He&#8217;s someone who reappeared in my life after years. Back then, we fell in love, but it was a &#8220;right person, wrong time&#8221; situation. I had to walk away. Now we&#8217;re grown-ups, and suddenly marriage is on the table. He&#8217;s gentle, kind &#8212; the kind of man who doesn&#8217;t come by often, let alone in my life. Ironically, with him, I don&#8217;t lose weight because he&#8217;s always feeding me. But I am losing sight of myself, and I can feel the slippery slope beneath me.</strong></p><p><strong>My next logical step was supposed to be a new job, one that would take me out of this country where I&#8217;ve been born and raised. I dream of packing up my cat and moving somewhere new, somewhere bigger. But he&#8217;s here, and with him, all those silly, fairytale notions of love are creeping back in, taking root again. I&#8217;m standing at a crossroads, Polly, and I don&#8217;t know which road to take.</strong></p><p><strong>My heart aches for love and companionship in this rat race to the top, but I can&#8217;t slow down now. My life is taking off. Six-year-old me is finally getting what she wanted, but what about teenage me, the one who was lonely and lost and always ended up with the wrong people? I&#8217;ll be 27 this year, and in the cultural context of my world, I&#8217;ve had a clock ticking over my head since I was 22, telling me to get married. I want the fiery, all-consuming ambition and the kind of love that doesn&#8217;t leave me shrinking into less of myself. But do I even have the capacity to juggle them without being consumed by one and being complacent in the other? And if it comes down to a choice, Polly, which one is worth keeping? Which one do I let go?</strong></p><p><strong>All Gas, No Brakes</strong></p><p>Dear AGNB,</p><p>You&#8217;ve set up an imaginary, binary problem (love or career?) based on imaginary conditions. Inside your mind, there is a &#8220;rat race to the top&#8221; in which you &#8220;can&#8217;t slow down.&#8221; There is a &#8220;clock ticking over [your] head.&#8221; Ambition is &#8220;fiery and all-consuming.&#8221; Love means &#8220;shrinking into less&#8221; of yourself or &#8220;losing sight&#8221; of yourself. You also can&#8217;t stand complacency which seems to include hating moderation, balance, hesitation. I know you&#8217;ve learned to sit with yourself and reflect, but you overall mindset is all about optimization. You are anti-flaw, anti-failure, anti-compromise, but you also believe that prioritizing one area of your life always means failing at or compromising your gains in another area.</p><p>In other words, you&#8217;ve set up your life as a win-lose puzzle on every front. If you surrender your life to love you&#8217;ll lose your chance at success and you&#8217;ll lose yourself in the process. If you follow your ambitions you&#8217;ll be doomed to spend your life alone and that ticking clock will only grow louder.</p><p>These extremes in your worldview spring from the fact that you approach everything in your life in an escapist, addictive way: You throw yourself into work in part to lose your longing for romance and your awareness of your deep need for connection. Then you throw yourself into love in order to blot out your other needs, and you ignore sleep, ignore your job, and abandon your normal schedule like a rebellious child who&#8217;s tired of her strict parents&#8217; rules.</p><p>And OF COURSE love feels amazing! It&#8217;s the only time you allow yourself to be frivolous, relax, follow your impulses instead of your rules. Love is a realm of strong emotions and indulgent sensations that you absolutely don&#8217;t allow yourself to enjoy under any other circumstances.</p><p>When I was in my twenties, I was like you. I couldn&#8217;t figure out why I was so obsessed with romance, but the answer was obvious: When I was alone (not with a boyfriend and not socializing), I forced myself to be productive and serious. I wasn&#8217;t allowed to eat something indulgent or relax or watch a movie or have a drink or wander around the world by myself. I had to be advancing my goals, getting shit done. I was allowed to write if it led to some insights or growth (intellectual, of course, not emotional &#8212; there is a difference). But if my writing felt like an indulgence with no purpose, I would quickly abandon it. </p><p>I defined pleasure and satisfaction as coming from outside forces. It didn&#8217;t even occur to me that I was in charge, that I could want things other people didn&#8217;t approve of or give me, that I could do things that only had value to me and me alone.</p><p>But if I was in love, I was allowed to wander around all day just talking and eating and drinking and relaxing and making out. Because of this, I often paired up with stoners and drinkers and people who were obsessed with music or movies or non-traditional jobs. I immersed myself in their impulse-driven, structure-less lives and then wondered why I always felt so adrift, why I always disappeared completely, why I couldn&#8217;t locate my own needs and desires from within the relationship.</p><p>The problem was that I associated my own needs and desires &#8211; and thoughts and feelings and ambitions &#8211; with anxiety and loneliness. I loved to escape into someone else&#8217;s world because it kept me from having to face myself, which included facing my depression, my shame, my big doubts about my life, and my self-hatred.</p><p>You&#8217;ve conquered the first part of this problem by learning to sit with yourself. That&#8217;s a great start to loving every side of yourself including your flaws, your challenges, and your shame. But I would urge you to move away from the mindset of &#8220;I&#8217;m better now&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;m always making more progress&#8221; and make more room for hesitation, doubts, setbacks, and even ambivalence. Because as long as you treat HITTING THE BRAKES as a kind of moral failure or mistake, you&#8217;re going to have trouble allowing your full, complex self to breathe freely and take its time to adjust to shifting life situations.</p><p>Giving your layered, complicated body and mind space to just live in the world without feeling anxious to SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM requires loosening your grip on the false binary you&#8217;ve presented in your letter. That means losing this strict religion you&#8217;ve built for yourself, the one that says that everything needs to happen on a certain timeline, the one that says staying in your country is a failure and being in love means surrendering yourself or disappearing and being a success means all gas and no brakes until you reach the top. I think you need to smash the ticking clock and take your foot off the gas. I think you need to slow down and get to know your shame, your anxieties, and your fears. </p><p>Because shame has its foot on this gas pedal. That&#8217;s not you. It doesn&#8217;t serve you to escape into middle-of-the-night conversations before you have to work. It doesn&#8217;t serve you to believe that this good man will either wreck your life and diminish your sense of self or he&#8217;ll need to be left in the dust. The absolutes and extremes of the addictive, escapist fantasy life you live in don&#8217;t support a balanced, calm, loving life with real people in it. They don&#8217;t even support true love or ambition in a sustainable way.</p><p>In order to build a balanced life, you have to have a vision of everything you want, and you have to dare to assert that this vision is possible. You have to say to yourself and others, &#8220;I want real love and I want a great career and my belief is that I can have both.&#8221; That might sound like MORE of a fantasy, but it&#8217;s the opposite: It&#8217;s an assertion of the strength of your desires. You very badly want the thrills of love and you also want the adventure and challenge of an amazing career. Accept that this is you. It doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to work much harder with no breaks and no doubts and no pauses to take in reality. It means you have to be honest, patient, direct, and deeply attuned to the world around you. </p><p>You have to say to your boyfriend, &#8220;I need to make sure that I assert my needs, desires, and limits in this relationship instead of sliding into an abyss with you. I think that&#8217;s what will make BOTH of us happy &#8212; building a solid life together instead of hiding out inside a fantasy.&#8221; You have to state your needs out loud and feel the strength and clarity that brings you.</p><p>In your daily life, balance requires you to give yourself a break from work, a break from intellectualizing your emotions, a break from analyzing the future, a break from this optimization mindset that seems to view compromise and rest as a form of weakness and retreat. I&#8217;m wondering if there&#8217;s some erasure of self in your childhood that echoes in this relentless path you&#8217;ve chosen for yourself. You feel better when you&#8217;re fully enmeshed and consumed. I believe there also might be people-pleasing and perfectionism in this picture, telling you that success and love are impossible unless you erase your needs, make yourself smaller, play a part, and pretend that you want nothing but what&#8217;s best for your loved one or your boss. My guess is that you grew up in the company of a strong personality who asked you to be a YES MAN.</p><p>What&#8217;s ironic is that the ego rewards of your career success serve as a kind of drug that keeps you high and keeps you living in the fantasy that you can stay high forever, that nothing matters more than mattering. These rewards are mirrored in the ego rewards of falling in love, which tell you that you can feel consumed by passion and love forever and nothing matters more than romance and being adored. I understand the pull of both of these forces. I don&#8217;t even want you to abandon them completely! Enjoy this moment in your life. It&#8217;s rare to feel so ecstatic and proud and on fire and passionate! Savor every minute of it.</p><p>But don&#8217;t let that fire trick you into thinking that life needs to stay exciting and perfect and passionate forever or you&#8217;ve failed. Use that fire to build a slightly more relaxing, balanced understanding of your unique, long-term plan for embracing an ambitious, loving, fulfilling life. Use the fire to fuel your growing belief in yourself, your blossoming voice, your new ability to stand up for what you want and need. Don&#8217;t let the fire inflame your insecurities and anxieties and imaginary demons.</p><p>Relaxation and mindfulness are not the path to complacency. Balance is not the path to surrender. Mature, open, honest love is not the path to weakness or erasure. It&#8217;s time to use your romantic imagination to build a vision of your future that&#8217;s less extreme and potentially tragic, less all or nothing, less fearful and ashamed in the face of potential mistakes and setbacks.</p><p>Becoming someone who knows how to hit the brakes occasionally &#8212; who knows how to say no, who knows how to invent a new path forward that no one else could see, who knows how to encourage other people to confront their own fears and anxieties &#8212; won&#8217;t turn you into a loveless failure. It will transform your already formidable strengths into something more resilient, more at peace, more attuned to the people around you.</p><p>Balance, patience, realism, and assertiveness will transform you from a striver into a leader. I want you to be a leader, because that&#8217;s the truest expression of your passion and your ambition. Your drive is a manifestation of your destined role in this world. But you have to be conscious and attuned and realistic and not impulsive and self-destructive and ashamed if you want to lead well and invite real, deep connections into your life. You have to confront your ego and challenge it and not let it push you into fantastical, perfectionistic escape routes. You have to show up every day and communicate your vision, edit your articles of faith, adjust to conditions on the ground, and demonstrate your love for and faith in the people around you.</p><p>It's hard work. It&#8217;s not about instantly knowing the exact perfect path. It&#8217;s not about sacrificing everything for success or love. But the good news is that you&#8217;ll have more love and more success and, most importantly, more satisfaction in your life when you extract yourself from the escapist cycle of self-abandonment and shame and fear of failure that you&#8217;re caught in now.</p><p>Your current struggle lies at the center of what you have to offer. This world has lost sight of what it takes to feel satisfied, and connected, and loved. When you embody these skills &#8212; how to relish the present, how to connect deeply with real, flawed people, how to show up and love in spite of your anxieties and fears &#8212; every obstacle in front of you becomes smaller. You lead by example, every day, just by welcoming reality, with all of its ugliness and horrors and flaws, and sharing your optimism, energy, intensity, and love of solving tough problems with the world.</p><p>I know that sounds pretty glowing and dreamy and idealistic. I know it&#8217;s hard to believe that you can balance everything without falling to pieces. It&#8217;s not that life won&#8217;t be tough or painful or confusing at times. It&#8217;s just that you&#8217;re a person who&#8217;s designed to crawl over mountains of sharp knives and garbage to find the sun. Honor that and trust it. It&#8217;s real, and the more you believe that, the more you&#8217;ll enjoy the difficulties and joys that lie ahead.</p><p>So pump the brakes a little. Let in some air. Focus on patience and observation. Notice the times when you lose yourself, and focus on moving back into your body, increasing your awareness of the moment, and allowing the imperfect contours of the world to be what they are without trying to control them. The more you calmly connect to who you are and where you are, the easier it will be to assert your beliefs, desires, and boundaries without fear. When you show up and you&#8217;re calm and direct, choices become simpler. Relationships become simpler. Career paths feel easier.</p><p>This is your year to ground yourself, to trust yourself, to confront your shame and blossom in the face of your fears. That work will be difficult and slow and painful, but it will inform everything you do from this moment forward. You were built for this hard work and you were built for this joy. Believe it.</p><p>Polly</p><div><hr /></div><p><em>Thanks for reading Ask Polly!

                "<img alt=\"A very Chicago gamble\" src=\"https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/content/images/2025/01/chicago-casino-capital-raise-dalle.jpg\" /><p>This column doesn&#x2019;t offer investment advice, as I am not a registered investment advisor. This is not merely a mandatory disclaimer; this is a warning. We will discuss some specific securities below that I am not <em>merely incapable</em> of recommending.</p><p>Finance performs a strange alchemy, teleporting value through time and space. Ordinarily, Bits about Money focuses more on the plumbing of it than the deals. But a deal enthusiast who goes by <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/theconservativeincomeinvestor\">The Conservative Income Investor</a> recently flagged a capital raise to me. It has everything: echoes of the culture that is the American PMC 2020-2024, complex financial structuring, a novel web application to move money, a crypto company in the background, and municipal politics. So it seems squarely within this column&#x2019;s beat.</p><p>The municipality happens to be Chicago, my hometown and (after a 20 year stint in Japan) current residence. And so I feel some sense of civic duty, as a Chicagoan, taxpayer, and reasonably financially sophisticated person, to say the following publicly: <em>What the hell, Chicago.</em></p><p>But before we get to present-day shenanigans, we need to go back several decades, because municipal politics is inextricable from the shenanigans.</p><h2 id=\"chicago-has-wanted-a-casino-for-a-long-time\">Chicago has wanted a casino for a long time</h2><p>Chicago and the state of Illinois more broadly have a deeply unserious polity. It has mortgaged its future through consistently overpaying public sector employees (principally, in Chicago, police/fire/teachers) and undertaxing. Neither decreasing total compensation of public sector employees nor reneging on previously-negotiated deferred compensation (pensions and healthcare for retirees) nor raising taxes to appropriate levels is considered politically palatable. One reason is that the <a href=\"https://www.ilga.gov/commission/lrb/conent.htm\">Illinois state constitution</a> (Article 13 Section 5) makes public employee pensions sacrosanct. The constitution is, of course, not a fact of nature; it is a political compromise by, again, a deeply unserious polity.</p><p>Long-time watchers of state and local politics know Illinois pensions are the <a href=\"https://www.illinoispolicy.org/illinois-needs-responsible-tier-2-pension-reform/\">worst funded in the nation</a>, state officials <a href=\"https://www.illinois.gov/news/press-release.26105.html\">celebrate</a> when Wall Street upgrades its <a href=\"https://illinoiscomptroller.gov/financial-reports-data/data-sets-portals/illinois-bond-debt\">credit rating</a> from close-to-junk, and the possibility of a federal bailout was a constant political issue for decades until it <a href=\"https://cookcountyrecord.com/stories/619617113-credit-200b-federal-bailout-not-pritzker-s-actions-for-improved-2023-il-budget\">happened by stealth during covid</a>.</p><p>And so Illinois and Chicago specifically are constantly on the make for new revenue streams. One which was mooted <a href=\"https://repryanspain.com/2024/02/07/looking-back-riverboat-gambling-enacted-in-illinois-february-7-1990/\">since my childhood in the 1980s</a> was an expansion of gambling. So-called sin taxes (on gambling, liquor, tobacco, and similar) are politically attractive because they do not cause as much opposition as raising consumption or property taxes.</p><p>And so Chicago has had a decades-long campaign to build a casino within city limits. Why couldn&#x2019;t Chicago actually get this done in several decades? One reason is the usual incompetence. The other reason is that the political economy of casinos is controversial. Many policies create winners and losers, but casinos inescapably create losers <em>much more directly </em>than most policies up for vote. Local political elites often band together against them, worried about siphoning money from local consumers. They also worry that they tend to create spillover effects, such as crime and moral collapse among a portion of patrons.</p><p>And so, as I once mentioned in a <a href=\"https://www.thinkingpoker.net/2020/12/episode-341-patrick-mckenzie/\">podcast with Thinking Poker</a>, pro-casino political coalitions try to pick off anti-casino political elites by assuaging their concerns and/or bribing them. (In Japan, the de facto concession was &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll limit the amount Japanese people can lose here and maximize for soaking Chinese tourists. Now, let&#x2019;s write that down in a way which doesn&#x2019;t say exactly that, because it sounds bad if you put it that way.&#x201d;)</p><p>In Chicago, much of the opposition came from African American political elites. They had the usual set of concerns for casinos, plus one other which is slightly more idiosyncratic. A belief with wide currency in that community is that the community would be much more wealthy than it currently is, but for vice entrepreneurs siphoning that community&#x2019;s resources out of the community. This belief has lead to e.g. <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-11/south-los-angeles-korean-liquor-protest-leimert-park-riots\">pogroms</a> against Korean liquor store owners. I direct interested readers to histories of the Rodney King riots or the Asian American experience in 20th century America. (This was covered extensively in an elective I took more than 20 years ago, and so I have since forgotten the academic citations for this true but parenthetical point.)</p><p>Bally&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://seminoletribune.org/ballys-wins-bid-for-chicago-casino/\">won the bid</a> for the newly licensed Chicago casino in 2022, in part due to offering the right mix of concessions and inducements in its <a href=\"https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/chicago-casino/home/hca.html\">Host Community Agreement</a>. One of those was promising Chicago that the new casino would be at least 25% owned by women and Minorities. The M is capital in the Chicago municipal code, and I will preserve this stylistic choice, because the word does not mean what most educated Americans assume it means. We shall return to that meaning later.</p><h2 id=\"the-stock-offering\">The stock offering</h2><p>In fulfillment of its obligations under the HCA, Bally&#x2019;s Chicago, Inc., an entity in the corporate web which will build and operate the casino, has <a href=\"http://ballyschicagoinvest.com\">conducted a stock offering</a> since December. It runs through January 2025.</p><p>The stock offering has a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1935799/000110465924132193/tm2310971-13_s1a.htm\">prospectus</a> associated with it. BCI does not appear to be relying on an exemption from registration, in the fashion that e.g. most startups would, restricting them to raising money from accredited investors.</p><p>While reading the prospectus, I read a <a href=\"https://wirepoints.org/no-white-men-allowed-in-ballys-chicago-share-offering-promoted-by-city-officials-wirepoints/\">much-remarked-upon</a> statement, and assumed it was a misprint.</p><p><em>This offering is only being made to individuals and entities that satisfy the Class A Qualification Criteria (as defined herein). Our Host Community Agreement with the City of Chicago requires that 25% of Bally&#x2019;s Chicago OpCo&#x2019;s equity must be owned by persons that have satisfied the Class A Qualification Criteria. The Class A Qualification Criteria include, among other criteria, that the person:</em></p><ul><li><em>if an individual, must be a woman;</em></li><li><em>if an individual, must be a Minority, as defined by MCC 2-92-670(n) (see below); or</em></li><li><em>if an entity, must be controlled by women or Minorities.</em></li></ul><p>Why did I assume this was a mistake? Well, for one thing, on the face of it Bally&#x2019;s has told the SEC that this offering is only available to Minorities who are <em>also</em> women, which does not match the intent expressed elsewhere or during their roadshow. I have immense sympathy for drafting errors. Bally&#x2019;s, feel free to let the lawyers know they forgot a significant &#x201c;or&#x201d; on the first bullet point. [<em>Post-publication edit</em>: An actual lawyer, not an Internet lawyer, informs me that the first bullet point has an implied &quot;or&quot; in this construction. Mea maxima culpa, associate who drafted this.] </p><p>The other reason I thought this was likely a mistake is that the American social, legal, and constitutional order is profoundly opposed to discrimination by race, and considers that action <em>malum in se</em>. Even when individual actors <em>want</em> to do it, they usually feel embarrassed enough about it to dissemble.&#xa0;</p><p>For example, the last few years tech companies <a href=\"https://x.com/patio11/status/1678235882481127427\">absolutely</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/youtube-hiring-for-some-positions-excluded-white-and-asian-males-lawsuit-says-1519948013\">notoriously</a> engaged in legally prohibited discrimination in hiring, sometimes as an intentionally directed and explicitly written down policy. This is often assumed to be a conspiracy theory by disaffected white males. Perhaps that is an understandable belief, since people who read the project plans either a) supported them or b) value their future careers and are therefore mostly not leaking them, and thus we only have public evidence of those project plans which end up screenshotted in litigation. Similarly, when I say that the state of California <a href=\"https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-story-of-vaccinateca/\">proudly engaged in redlining in the provision of lifesaving medical care</a> in 2021, many people of good-will assume that I simply <em>must</em> be mistaken.&#xa0;<em>I get it, but I was there.</em></p><p>Returning from the ancient history of 2021 to this very week: Chicago has directed a private entity to segregate, and that entity is segregating, principally via web application. If you attempt to engage Bally&#x2019;s for an investment here, you will see the following blocking question during qualification stages for the investment opportunity. (The web application will also ask for your name, address, social security number, and accredited investor status.)</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"A very Chicago gamble\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"328\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfg7xfR4JSU8RMO64xkyKGTLWjifriOMQebvfwoKv_w6Dfuf_jMUft-B571gxvoZhURUfagRAC-sJ-8K6-KSEkW-1Ywd0LrxaU17bdMDnVoC2f5M8mqheigRD5aLWfe93jD5uoHsg?key=JKwqz4E9flWfAud9N2aVoVGT\" width=\"624\" /></figure><p>There is a right answer to this question. If you give the wrong answer, Bally&#x2019;s will decline you the opportunity to invest. You get entirely stopped by the web application.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"A very Chicago gamble\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"87\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfglxb7-tKG8dxnItCIa0JYtrPBdxwGifDpBb1CGIt0aHXgW2I9yb4OVatYhUvQKrIGAMXReQWx8HIuG2-Rf8t7jYAfG2EaQFKhth-dOfbeiTUB-gQDLkIY-lUu3uK3tuGYI6tQGg?key=JKwqz4E9flWfAud9N2aVoVGT\" width=\"624\" /></figure><p>I express no opinion on whether this is legal, by Bally&#x2019;s or Chicago. After all, I am not a lawyer, and this has certainly been seen by many lawyers at this point, in e.g. preparing the submission to the SEC. Presumably all of them went through 1L courses which introduced concepts like the <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/\">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, case law which says government actions discriminating by race are <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12391\">subject to strict scrutiny</a>, and case law which says that the government cannot proxy through a private entity to do things it is prohibited to do itself. And clearly no one admitted to the bar in Illinois thinks that Chicago can waive the U.S. Constitution if it considers that politically advantageous to get a gridlocked casino through municipal politics.</p><p>So I will charitably assume the existence of a memo where competent professionals have laid out a case for the legality of this course of action. They must have concluded that no future Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, not even in an administration elected after the Host Community Agreement had been inked, would descend upon this official act like the hammer of an avenging god.</p><p>As Matt Levine <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-01-23/crypto-perpetual-motion-machines?srnd=undefined\">beat me to observing</a>: <em>awkward timing</em>.</p><h2 id=\"chicago%E2%80%99s-peculiar-definition-of-minority\">Chicago&#x2019;s peculiar definition of Minority</h2><p>Long-time observers of Chicago politics might opine that the city very rarely does anything without creating a carveout for politically connected individuals. The local phrase for this sort of social connection is having &#x201c;clout&#x201d; or, sometimes, &#x201c;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Achicagotribune.com+%22is+clouted%22\">is clouted</a>.&#x201d; You can find examples of the sort of carveouts Chicago reserves for the clouted in the professional histories of the board members of Bally&#x2019;s Chicago, Inc, for example, which are included in the prospectus.</p><p>So what&#x2019;s the carveout here? The definition of a racial or ethnic minority is a legendarily contentious one in U.S. politics, largely because inclusion or exclusion from it makes one eligible (or ineligible) for concrete benefits. Sites of contention often include e.g. are Asian Americans a minority, or are e.g. Cuban Americans Hispanic, etc.</p><p>Chicago leaves itself an out for its definition of Minority, which <em>lets it designate any individual or group as a Minority</em>, on an ad hoc, unreported, unaccountable basis. That sounds like I must be strawmanning Chicago. See the below screenshot and explanation in the prospectus</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"A very Chicago gamble\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"149\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd253IewOivwCOqOI6zIiGgkVhxz_c5RJK1KsrkT8aRGtEbZ3FGTl4mh6-bwfpWCvSehDTDJtsL4mxrHOWrAnq5KzAvEFxudIHBpBU1ykYmsTuLt1mvzyrOVnRsWGfEzNcREf1L?key=JKwqz4E9flWfAud9N2aVoVGT\" width=\"624\" /></figure><p>Quoting the prospectus:</p><p><em>Qualification under [the final] clause is determined on a case-by-case basis and there is no exhaustive or definitive list of groups or individuals that the City of Chicago has determined to qualify as Minority under this clause. However, in the event the City of Chicago identifies any additional groups or individuals as falling under this clause in the future, members of such groups would satisfy the Class A Qualification Criteria.</em></p><p>Now, fairminded people reading &#x201c;groups&#x2026; found by the City of Chicago to be socially disadvantaged by having suffered racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias within American society&#x201d; would note &#x201c;Well, OK, on the face of it, that definitely includes e.g. Jewish Americans or Irish Americans. We have some lamentable history as a nation and city, sure. But no intellectually serious person in the United States considers Irish Americans &#x2018;a racial or ethnic minority&#x2019; <em>in the common usage of the term</em>.&#x201d; And thus, the capitalization of Minority.</p><p>You&#x2019;ll have to ask the city for their list of ad hoc exceptions made under this bullet point. Long-time watchers of Chicago municipal politics, however, might say that asking is of limited utility.</p><p>I will note that, as a matter of engineering fact, the web application will blithely accept self-certification under this bullet point <em>for anyone</em>. You are welcome to your guess as to whether Bally&#x2019;s or any city employee will review the 1,000 investors individually and, if they review them, what the process is for determining whether e.g. a particular Patrick counts as a Minority or not.&#xa0;</p><p>I&#x2019;d wager there is no process at all here. It seems like a better bet than most offered in the casino.</p><h2 id=\"reading-a-complex-corporate-structure\">Reading a complex corporate structure</h2><p>Bally&#x2019;s Chicago is a product of Bally&#x2019;s, a publicly traded company. You can read <a href=\"https://www.ballys.com/investor-relations/financials/default.aspx\">their 10-Ks</a>. According to their <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001747079/e72243a7-c47d-4ca7-a9fc-e91f8f95fb18.pdf\">most recent quarterly report</a>, they operate 15 casinos across the U.S., and have substantial online gambling operations. Like many casinos, they are <em>somewhat</em> diversified, insofar as a casino resort also functions as a hotel and restaurant/bar/etc venue.</p><p>Bally&#x2019;s Chicago has a complex capital stack, which one would probably need to understand to evaluate the opportunity to invest in it. I am not saying &#x201c;complex&#x201d; as a criticism: this is fairly ho hum by the standards of large commercial real estate developments, a subject I am not an expert on but <a href=\"https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com/episodes/the-hundred-year-old-telegram-worth-5-million-with-jim-mckenzie-2/\">grew up hearing about at the dinner table</a>. I <em>am</em> heavily implying that I would not expect a Chicagoan picked at random, or for that matter an alderman, to be able to look at the following diagram and correctly describe what it means. Prospectus, ibid, pg 145.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"A very Chicago gamble\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"408\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfakivtPLtYz2pNNM_02Trf7NJnNR1aZxaCHrGIHSGTyFPtA-twKGNOYJxcLqEQ0jEtYeRM13SqSlScqLvOVP-p171kC1nafdnNxXToDe6XwJ38R2fv2p1p3Wj-1j1O4ucLt7RiOg?key=JKwqz4E9flWfAud9N2aVoVGT\" width=\"624\" /></figure><p>The entity which Chicago is stumping for is Bally&#x2019;s Chicago, Inc. (BCI), the central square on that diagram. <s>Marks</s> investors are receiving ownership in <em>that entity</em>, not in <em>the casino</em>, which will be operated by Bally&#x2019;s Chicago Operating Company, LLC (BCOC). That entity gets 25% economic interest in the future profits (insert <em>very material</em> asterisk here) of the casino; the other 75% flows to Bally&#x2019;s Chicago Holding Company, LLC (BCHC). BCHC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bally&#x2019;s, Inc, the publicly traded company.</p><p>When one offers someone the opportunity to invest in something, one has to decide upon a valuation for the something. The price of a slice of the pie is set in notional reference to the price of the whole pie.</p><p>Bally&#x2019;s says that its good faith guesstimate on the whole pie is the economic interest in future profits of the Chicago casino is&#x2026; <em>a billion dollars exactly</em>. The prospectus, as is wont for these situations, disclaims floridly that that price might not be accurate. One example of many: &#x201c;We made a number of assumptions to determine the price of our Class A Interests. If any of our assumptions are incorrect, including our assumptions regarding the total enterprise value of the Company, then the Class A Interests will be worth less than the price stated in this prospectus. In such case, the return on investment or rate of return on an investment in our Class A Interests could be significantly below an investor&#x2019;s expectation.&#x201d;</p><p>Bally&#x2019;s will, as is standard and customary for this sort of thing, pretend that investors have read and understood the ~200 page prospectus, and civil society will pretend to believe them.</p><p>It isn&#x2019;t <em>extremely</em> <em>improper</em> to pick a billion dollars out of one&#x2019;s hindquarters as an investment valuation. That particular number exerts a sort of memetic quality in e.g. Silicon Valley, and there are legendary amounts of negotiation between sophisticated parties to accept just a bit more structure to get a e.g. $920 million valuation to a $1 billion valuation, because so-called unicorn status is good for PR, for attracting prospective employees, and (a real factor) for founder ego.</p><p>But if you invest at a valuation not justified by the fundamentals of the investment, you will tend to underperform. This is an inescapable fact of investing. (And that is why the sophisticated investors, accepting a &#x201c;worse&#x201d; valuation, want &#x201c;better&#x201d; structure to compensate for it.)</p><p>And this partially explains why Chicago is holding a roadshow in African American churches attempting to convince participants to invest in a mezzanine-y equity slice of a casino at a $1 billion valuation, perhaps at 100X leverage. (I tip my cap to <a href=\"https://thetriibe.com/2025/01/chicagos-black-residents-can-invest-in-ballys-casino/\">publicly available reporting</a> of the roadshow.) And not, for example, attempting to convince Goldman Sachs to put together some sophisticated investors and take down the $250 million allocation.</p><h2 id=\"is-this-valuation-a-gift-to-investors\">Is this valuation a gift to investors?</h2><p>Chicago&#x2019;s pitch to investors, delivered (per above reporting by Triibe) by &#x201c;City Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin and members of the Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus&#x201d;, emphasizes the potential of creating &#x201c;generational wealth&#x201d; (direct quote) with this casino investment. This point of view aligns with the above described political economy of attempting to buy off influential communities and/or community elites with an equity carveout, which successfully got this particular casino through decades of political gridlock.</p><p>And so the investment case <em>implies</em> that Bally&#x2019;s is intentionally giving takers something for nothing. That is, they must be sandbagging the valuation they assigned to this bundle of rights: it&#x2019;s not really worth $1 billion, it is worth e.g. $5 billion. Only you favored Chicagoans well-loved by your alderman are able to buy at the non-market price, leading to essentially free money. Not merely small amounts of it, either. Generational. Wealth.</p><p>The pitch very likely explicitly said the requisite words about this being a risky investment, wink wink, and very definitely described an opportunity for extreme levels of leverage and a lengthy expected road to ROI, which we&#x2019;ll return to in a moment.</p><p>Do I think sophisticated investors would agree with Bally&#x2019;s that this bundle of rights is worth $1 billion? <strong>Reader, I do not.</strong></p><p>One reason is the perception of an absence: why is this pitch being given to individual savers in a church at a minimum investment of $250, and not in a swank office to an entity capable of committing $25 million? But perhaps I&#x2019;m just suspicious.</p><p>No, let&#x2019;s go to more direct evidence: if 25% of this bundle of rights is worth $250 million, then 75% must be worth $750 million, right? And if an entity owning 75% of the bundle, Bally&#x2019;s, also owns 14 other casinos, online gambling properties, and similar, then that entity must be worth a lot more than $750 million, right?</p><p><strong>The market does not agree with this assessment</strong>. The entire market capitalization of Bally&#x2019;s (NYSE: BALY) is, as of this writing, ~$1.5 billion. What&#x2019;s the difference between the $50 million average imputed value of the other casinos and the $750 million imputed value of the Chicago casino?<strong> The $750 million is <em>made up</em>, that&#x2019;s what.</strong></p><p>And, again, the <em>real unspoken logic</em> of this pitch is that the bundle of rights is getting sold on the cheap, and that it is actually worth much more than $1 billion. It very clearly is not, or sophisticated investors would be swooping in and buying BALY&#x2019;s common stock. Crack it open like an oyster and dig into that sweet sweet Chicago gambling revenue if you need to!</p><p>This is somewhat elementary and handwavy napkin analysis of a complicated business which, like most casinos and hotels, is heavily levered with a complex capital stack. But the investment case gets smothered by a napkin.</p><h2 id=\"capital-stack-arbitrage-or-giving-retail-1001-leverage-on-single-stock-issuances\">Capital stack arbitrage, or, giving retail 100:1 leverage on single stock issuances</h2><p>The Host Community Agreement, as above, obligates Bally&#x2019;s to find a way to sell preferred Chicagoans $250 million of stock. This was likely complicated by rich Chicagoans not being suckers and less-well-off Chicagoans not having $250 million lying around.</p><p>And so Bally&#x2019;s has introduced a novel structure.</p><p>In brief, that structure sells stock to investors on credit, with the credit being extended by Bally&#x2019;s, and paid down by future dividend distributions of the stock. If you&#x2019;re very interested in the mechanics, you can find them at length in the prospectus, but the complex legal code is an excuse for this screenshot:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"A very Chicago gamble\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdd2zG5uipfo6O6HV1VDhABAIppuInvPo-0xgN4q2GRY7I0BwQQ4_vQKB4hw5ft856pfkSflAs76usXl_a6BaOJ6NAXMR8avY1J0U6Tx7tMesCYHXf1XivHTTz8niPJYvQgPsDu?key=JKwqz4E9flWfAud9N2aVoVGT\" width=\"624\" /></figure><p>What is the &#x201c;Attributable Subordinated Loan?&#x201d; I&#x2019;m glad you asked. Bally&#x2019;s staked (ba dum bum) BCI with a few hundred million dollars to fund development. Where did it find the money to do that? A mix of equity and debt financing, as is common for virtually all complex commercial real estate transactions. Bally&#x2019;s, per their <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001747079/0a22a582-5179-4a27-8a24-cbfc84043b0f.pdf\">most recent 10-K</a>, has long-term debt from sophisticated investors which costs them 5.x% per year. (It would be more expensive if they wanted to lock that down today.)</p><p>In return for Bally&#x2019;s advancing BCI money through BCHC, BCI owed BCHC money, on an intercompany IOU. This capital offering cancels that intercompany IOU and replaces it with the Subordinated Loans. The prospectus does not quote the rate that the left pocket of Bally&#x2019;s charged the right pocket of Bally&#x2019;s. It does quote the rate for the Subordinated Loans: 11% annually compounding quarterly.</p><p>The road show makes much of the fact that this leverage is non-recourse. Quoting the Triibe reporting again:</p><p><em>The loan is non-recourse, explained Sidney Dillard of Loop Capital Markets, who is the underwriter of the offering, during the information session. &#x201c;That loan is not recourse, meaning that you are not responsible for it,&#x201d; she said.</em></p><p>I am not someone who has ever offered SEC-registered securities for sale, but I am aware that when one does that, one has to adopt a <em>certain level of care</em> with respect to how one simultaneously a) sells a product that one has to offer and b) describes the operations of that product without wandering into lying.</p><p>And so <em>this writer</em> would not describe &#x201c;non-recourse&#x201d; as a loan one is not responsible for. I have a non-recourse mortgage. I am very, very much responsible for paying the mortgage. If I do not pay the mortgage, I expect to swiftly not own the property securing the mortgage. The &#x201c;non-recourse&#x201d; bit means that the lender cannot come after your <em>other</em> assets or income, for example by suing you for a judgement, then forcing you to disgorge your savings account or e.g. interests you own in your small business&apos; LLC.</p><p>The Subordinated Loans are, per the prospectus (probably a bit more reliable than the understanding of e.g. Chicago employees on the finer details), not between the owners of the Class A-{1,2,3} equity and any Bally&#x2019;s entities. They are strictly loans between Bally&#x2019;s entities themselves. Those loans are senior to Class A-{1,2,3} equity in the payments waterfall of future profits (we need that asterisk again!) from the casino to equity holders. The expectation is that Bally&#x2019;s will individually book repayments against records which are kept on a per-shareholder basis without actually obligating the shareholder, <em>while keeping the actual cash thrown off by the casino</em>, prior to eventually releasing a shareholder from the indebtedness that Bally&#x2019;s will say that, technically speaking, they have not actually incurred.</p><p>At that point, the shareholder will own the slice of equity that an unsophisticated listener of that roadshow might think they own free-and-clear.</p><p>Now, Bally&#x2019;s forecasts that many shareholders will be very underwater on these investments. (Wow, that&#x2019;s a <em>robust</em> sentence.) Prospectus, ibid, pg 23:</p><p><em>Given the capital intensity of developing, constructing, opening and operating a casino resort project of this scale, we currently expect that Bally&#x2019;s Chicago OpCo will not have any OpCo cash available for distribution until approximately three to five years after our permanent resort and casino begins operations.</em></p><p>Assuming the most charitable estimate from that range, a Class A-1 shareholder will have $250 of equity securing a notional $25,000 investment and future obligations of approximately $34,000 (three years of compound interest at 11% on initial principal of $24,750). This suggests that the holder&#x2019;s equity value is <strong>planned to be negative</strong> and that no sophisticated investor would purchase that investment for the $25,000 which the unsophisticated shareholder might believe it to be worth in 3 years. They might be willing to pay something more similar to, hmm, negative nine thousand dollars.</p><p>Seen in that light <em>this offer of investment sounds predatory</em>. But don&#x2019;t worry, Chicagoans, Bally&#x2019;s has your back. You do not have to worry about not being able to sell your stock due to its lack of intrinsic value, because you are not able to sell your stock. Prospectus, ibid, pg 179 under heading Shares Eligible For Future Sale, and elsewhere in the document.</p><p>Class A-4 holders, the ones with no notional debt, who purchased their shares for $25,000 cash-on-the-barrel, are not eligible to sell their stock at any time except as allowed by Bally&#x2019;s to people approved by Bally&#x2019;s. (I&#x2019;ll flag that this is not an unusual term in private equities. Bally&#x2019;s pre-commitment to discriminating racially against future prospective buyers? <em>That&#x2019;s</em> unusual.)</p><p>Buyers of Class A-{1,2,3} stock are unable to sell until the associated Subordinated Loan is paid off in full.</p><p>One wonders whether senior Chicago officials will be doing a roadshow in 2030 explaining what happened.</p><h2 id=\"the-casino-will-not-distribute-profits-per-se\">The casino will not distribute profits, per se</h2><h2 id=\"id\"></h2><p>While the natural expectation is that one is participating in the profits of the casino, the prospectus helpfully clarifies that one is not. The &quot;cash available for distribution&quot; does not necessarily correspond 1:1 with profits. It... well. See the discussion on page 22 and 23 of the prospectus, including the excerpt below.</p><p><em>While we and Bally&#x2019;s Chicago OpCo intend to make distributions equal to 100% of the cash available for distribution and OpCo cash available for distribution, respectively, on a quarterly basis, the actual amount of any distributions may fluctuate depending on our and Bally&#x2019;s Chicago OpCo&#x2019;s ability to generate cash from operations and our and Bally&#x2019;s Chicago OpCo&#x2019;s cash flow needs, which, among other things, may be impacted by debt service payments on our or Bally&#x2019;s Chicago OpCo&#x2019;s senior indebtedness, capital expenditures, potential expansion opportunities and the availability of financing alternatives, the need to service any future indebtedness or other liquidity needs and general industry and business conditions, including the pace of the construction and development of our permanent resort and casino in Chicago. Our Board will have full discretion on how to deploy cash available for distribution, including the payment of dividends. Any debt we or Bally&#x2019;s Chicago OpCo may incur in the future is likely to restrict our and Bally&#x2019;s Chicago OpCo ability to pay dividends or distributions, and such restriction may prohibit us and Bally&#x2019;s Chicago OpCo from making distributions, or reduce the amount of cash available for distribution and OpCo cash available for distribution.</em></p><p>Now, as someone who grew up with a father constantly complaining about sharp operating in Chicago commercial real estate, I can quickly outline about two dozen different ways for one to cause the operating company here to a) transfer money to other corporate entities and b) therefore have less cash available for distribution.</p><p>As a representative but not limiting example, you can probably choose your own marks for technology services from a parent to a great-grandchild subsidiary. Sure, there is some notional expectation that the marks be at arms-length price, but what is the arms-length price for e.g. casino loyalty accounting software and a particular chain&apos;s database of existing users? What low-resourced investor could possibly mount a court challenge against <em>the entity with all the data necessary to value that asset</em>. In Las Vegas, a casino has to calculate and diligently communicate the house edge before raking punters. Here... not so much.</p><p>That would require sharp operating... of a sort which is <em>extremely routine</em> in Chicago commercial real estate. This is a constant risk of being the junior partner in a structure, particularly without an aligned senior partner who would be as adversely impacted by sharp operating as you would be. Of course, here the senior partner owns e.g. the database they are renting to the entity that they also control, and so funds available for distribution from that entity might not match the expectations of junior partners.</p><p>Pick your sponsors carefully, folks.</p><h2 id=\"tax-consequences-of-this-offering\">Tax consequences of this offering</h2><p>Suppose, and this is very unlikely because it is illegal (<a href=\"https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/key-topics/margin-accounts\">Reg T</a>) but run with it, that one has a typical brokerage account in the United States and, with $250, purchases $25,000 of marketable securities. Those securities periodically throw off dividend payments. One periodically pays one&#x2019;s brokerage interest, because one has borrowed money from the brokerage to buy those securities on margin.</p><p>In the typical case, one would be taxed upon those interest payments, which are income. One does not simply <em>net</em> one&#x2019;s margin interest against that income before paying taxes. One instead must itemize deductions, and then one <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-schedule-a-form-1040\">will be able to</a> (on Schedule A) deduct investment expenses, as described in <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550\">Publication 550</a>. Feel free to run this by your accountant; the details get complicated and wonky.</p><p>If one does not itemize, as many lower-income taxpayers do not, one must of course simply pay the tax on the entirety of one&#x2019;s interest income. If one protests that one does not actually <em>have</em> any interest income, because it has been taken by one&#x2019;s brokerage to pay margin interest, the IRS will not be maximally sympathetic.</p><p>Bally&#x2019;s has very creative professionals involved in the structuring of this offering, and realizing the above issue would compromise fitness for purpose, they have&#x2026; adopted a theory. I will quote that theory, from the prospectus, verbatim. I have taken the liberty of bolding an important bit in the middle of this.</p><p><em>Section 305 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that if a corporation distributes property to some shareholders and other shareholders have an increase in their proportionate interests in the assets or earnings and profits of the corporation, such other shareholders may be deemed to receive a distribution that could be a taxable dividend. In this case, because we and Bally&#x2019;s expect to treat the Subordinated Loans as &#x201c;stock&#x201d; for U.S. federal income tax purposes, &#x201c;property&#x201d; distributions will likely be considered to be made to &#x201c;some shareholders&#x201d; of Bally&#x2019;s Chicago, Inc. as payments are made on the Subordinated Loans, and equivalent cash (&#x201c;property&#x201d;) distributions will be made with respect to the Class A-4 Interests. In addition, as payments are made on the Subordinated Loans, particularly those that repay the original principal amount of such Subordinated Loans, the proportionate interests of holders of our Class A-1 Interests, Class A-2 Interests and Class A-3 Interests in the assets or earnings and profits of Bally&#x2019;s Chicago, Inc. may be viewed as increasing. Accordingly, it is possible that such increase could be treated as a deemed distribution under Section 305 of the Code or otherwise as taxable income to such holders under other theories. However, under the Treasury Regulations relating to Section 305 of the Code and other IRS administrative guidance, certain financing arrangements in the form of preferred stock investments that fund a corporation and then are systematically eliminated through property distributions until they are fully retired, and are designed to facilitate the ownership of a business with an effect of increasing another stockholder&#x2019;s proportionate interests in the assets or earnings and profits of a corporation over such period, do not result in a deemed distribution to such other stockholder. The applicability of these authorities to the holders of our Class A-1 Interests, Class A-2 Interests and Class A-3 Interests in this situation is uncertain. <strong>Although the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position, and this discussion assumes, that U.S. Holders of applicable series of Class A Interests would not be treated as receiving a deemed distribution from us or otherwise realizing income as a result of repayment of the Subordinated Loans corresponding to such shares. However, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a contrary position</strong>, for example, treating the proportionate interest in our earnings and profits owned by U.S. Holders of the applicable series of Class A Interests as having increased upon repayment of the Subordinated Loans corresponding to such shares, and treating such U.S. Holders as having received a distribution. In that case, such deemed distribution will be taxable as a dividend, return of capital or capital gain as described above under &#x201c;&#x2014; Distributions,&#x201d; and U.S. Holders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax without the receipt of any cash. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors about the application of Code Section 305 and any other potential deemed receipt of income risk with respect to our Class A Interests .</em></p><p>Now, I&#x2019;m neither a lawyer, tax accountant, nor am I someone who listened carefully to the roadshow when it doubtlessly stepped through this for the benefit of the audience. But here&#x2019;s what it means:</p><p>Bally&#x2019;s is taking the position, though they acknowledge that the IRS might disagree, that owners of the Class A-{2,3,4} interests aren&#x2019;t <em>actually</em> getting any income until the Subordinated Loans have been paid in full. This means that they don&#x2019;t have to pay income taxes in years where they are not actually receiving cash distributions.</p><p>No, they wait until the Subordinated Loan is paid in full, and then immediately owe income taxes in one whack, at the difference between their basis in the stock (say, $250) and the then-FMV of the stock (say, $25,000). Resulting in Bally&#x2019;s diligently filing a document with the IRS saying that e.g. a lower-income Chicagoan has just received a bit less than $25,000 in income from them, and should probably pay taxes on it. You can, of course, receive income without receiving <em>immediately available</em> <em>cash</em>; it happens all the time in tech, and is the cause of much structuring to avoid the consequences of it, which can be painful for e.g. early career employees.&#xa0;</p><p>Those taxes will be paid substantially out-of-pocket, because there is almost no conceivable universe where a stock of an actual healthy operating enterprise worth e.g. $25,000 pays an ordinary dividend of e.g. $5,000. The market would adjust the value of the stock upwards to account for the extraordinarily rich stream of dividends, which would adjust the tax bill upwards.</p><p>Financially sophisticated investors might prepare for a tax bomb like this by e.g. borrowing against the value of the stock. That&#x2019;s basically impossible for this issuance, due to the stock not being publicly listed, the restrictions on transfer, small dollar amounts, etc. The other option is, of course, selling the stock, to whomever Bally&#x2019;s deigns to approve.</p><p>Tax-motivated transactions are, of course, <em>motivated transactions</em>, and the lucky buyer will probably be able to extract a bit of a deal, doubly so because they are likely much more sophisticated than the initial buyer of the stock, and they have less risk to account for (because of e.g. several years of operating history of the casino before the tax bomb explodes).</p><h2 id=\"in-conclusion\">In conclusion</h2><p>I am not an investment advisor, and not your investment advisor. I am, however, a recreational poker player who lives in Chicago. I intend to periodically donate money to the Chicago economy by making poor decisions on the river at Bally&#x2019;s Chicago. </p><p>I do not, however, presently intend to participate in Bally&#x2019;s stock offering, nor do I presently intend to buy their common stock.</p><p>I will note, out of an overabundance of scrupulousness, that I own a tiny amount of MGM stock, which is a direct competitor to Bally&#x2019;s. I caught the poker bug at a conference in Las Vegas (hosted at the Tropicana, since acquired by Bally&#x2019;s and then <a href=\"https://www.ballys.com/news/news-details/2024/Tropicana-Las-Vegas-Implosion-to-Make-Way-for-the-As-Ballpark-and-Ballys-Entertainment-Resort-Destination-2024-9NZuey6eTG/default.aspx\">brought down in a controlled implosion</a>).</p><p>MGM, across the street, actually had poker tables. I have had many enjoyable post-conference excursions staying at their hotel to (in several but not all years) lose money at those tables. I bought the stock for the same reason I buy stock in every hotel, airline, bank, and similar I use: in the unlikely event a not-particularly-high-stakes poker player has a routine customer service complaint, Investor Relations is available as an escalation strategy, over e.g. hotel staff who might be long-since inured to listening to complaints from people who lost money in a casino.</p><p>Oh yeah, I mentioned that there is a crypto angle to this. The registrar and transfer agent for offering 100:1 leverage to retail investors on a casino stock is, see prospectus pg 41, <a href=\"https://www.bitgo.com/\">BitGo Trust</a>. If I had made up that detail, as a crypto skeptic, you might have accused me of being a bit on the nose.</p><p>&#xa0;</p>"

                "<p>What does \u201calgorithmic ranking\u201d bring to mind for you? Personally, I get visions of political ragebait and supplement hucksters and unnecessary cleavage. I see cratering attention spans and groups of friends on the subway all blankly swiping at glowing rectangles. I see overconfident charlatans and the hollow eyes eyes of someone reviewing 83 photo she just made her boyfriend take of her in front of a sunset. Most of all, I see dreams of creative expression perverted into a desperate scramble to do whatever it takes to please the Algorithm.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, lots of people like algorithmic ranking, too.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2013/05/depression-part-two.html\"><img alt=\"&quot;I like how it shows me cool stuff&quot;\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/ranking/coffee.png\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I theorize that the skeptics are right and algorithmic ranking is in fact bad. But it\u2019s not algorithmic ranking <em>per se</em> that\u2019s bad\u2014it\u2019s just that the algorithms you\u2019re used to don\u2019t care about your goals. That might be an inevitable consequence of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification\">\u201censhittification\u201d</a>, but the solution isn\u2019t to avoid all algorithms, but just to avoid algorithms you can\u2019t <em>control</em>. This will become increasingly important in the future as algorithmic ranking becomes algorithmic everything.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-algorithmic-ranking-is-bad-for-some-people-sometimes\">Why algorithmic ranking is bad for some people sometimes</h2>\n\n<p>You\u2019ve heard it all before. I think algorithmic ranking leads many people to spend time and emotional energy on things they\u2019d rather not spend them on. I also think it leads lots of people to believe preposterous bullshit promoted by charismatic charlatans. I\u2019m disturbed when I see how kids interact with addictive algorithms, but then I notice that adults are much the same. You know the story.</p>\n\n<p>A common defense of algorithmic ranking is that \u201cyour feed is your problem\u201d. If you\u2019re getting political ragebait and unnecessary cleavage, then that\u2019s on you for engaging with that stuff. If you <em>actually</em> cared about the things you <em>pretend</em> you care about, everything would be fine. The problem is looking you in the mirror.</p>\n\n<p>I find this defense bewildering and almost hostile. I mean, where is it spelled out <em>how</em> you\u2019re supposed to behave to get the content you want? Maybe there are little like buttons, but what do they do? How do they interact with all the other signals, like what you watch? It\u2019s unclear.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I\u2019m sure that many of the people who complain about ragebait and cleavage are in fact drawn to them in some way. Maybe they don\u2019t swipe away fast enough when that stuff is inserted into their endless content trough. If they only had eyes for philosophy lectures and meditation videos, maybe that\u2019s all they\u2019d see.</p>\n\n<p>OK, but so what? Where\u2019s the empathy? <em>Everyone</em> has some divergence between the urges they feel and the urges they wish they felt. We don\u2019t judge alcoholics who throw away their booze. We don\u2019t make fun of gambling addicts who avoid travel to Vegas or Monaco. So why is it wrong to not want lurid but unhealthy content dangled in front of you?</p>\n\n<p>One of the fundamental arts of being a human is using your \u201cbetter self\u201d to try to control your \u201clesser self\u201d. You can put a giant calendar on your wall to track when you exercise. You can keep junk food out of your home. You can write your algorithmic ranking manifestos using an app that permanently deletes everything if you stop typing for 5 seconds. These tricks are good. We need more of them! Algorithmic ranking\u2014as we know it\u2014is the opposite.</p>\n\n<p>So what would I propose instead? How about\u2026 sliders? Why can\u2019t I click a slider to say \u201cmore educational content\u201d or \u201cless political rage\u201d or \u201cno David Sinclair-esque supplement huckster bullshit\u201d?</p>\n\n<p>Or how about an algorithm that just does what it says on the tin? Remember, YouTicBooX might let you \u201clike\u201d stuff, but the algorithm\u2019s <em>goal</em> isn\u2019t to show you stuff you\u2019d like. The goal is to make money. Your likes are just another feature to be integrated with the rest of your behavioral profile for increasing engagement and targeting ads, thank you very much. The algorithm is running <em>on</em> you, not <em>for</em> you.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"but-what-about-the-market\">But what about the market?</h2>\n\n<p>Another common defense of current algorithms goes like this: If they\u2019re so bad, then why did they win? If people <em>wanted</em> sliders, they would have picked services with sliders. But they didn\u2019t. Go make SliderTube if you want. No one cares. There isn\u2019t some pent-up demand for algorithms that give more control to our better selves.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes people also gesture at the <a href=\"https://nothinghuman.substack.com/p/the-tyranny-of-the-marginal-user\">tyranny of the marginal user</a>. The idea is that, sure, power users like control. But where companies really compete is in the fight for the \u201cmarginal user\u201d, the person who is <em>almost</em> ready to quit. This person only vaguely understands what a phone is, has never heard of \u201calgorithms\u201d, likes flashing lights, and has the attention span of a pissed-off chimpanzee. They will not tolerate any complexity, so all sliders must go. Sorry, power users.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s clearly <em>something</em> to these arguments. But still: If your portal to the world is designed for the marginal user, surely you\u2019ve gone wrong <em>somewhere</em>, no?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-happened-to-netflix\">What happened to Netflix?</h2>\n\n<p>In the long-long ago, Netflix had star ratings. You\u2019d rate stuff between 1 and 5 stars and get a sorted list of predictions:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Chunking Express</td>\n      <td>4.49</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Days of Being Wild</td>\n      <td>4.51</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Solaris</td>\n      <td>4.57</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>In the Mood for Love</td>\n      <td>4.62</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World</td>\n      <td>4.98</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Nowadays, you get a disorienting set of categories like DARK COMEDIES ABOUT ITALIAN FEUDALISM and LIFE IS SHORT\u2014WATCH IT AGAIN and THINGS YOU\u2019RE IN THE MIDDLE OF, HELPFULLY PLACED IN A INCONSISTENT LOCATION. Instead of star ratings, there are \u201cmatch percentages\u201d, but you have to interact to see them and they always seem to be 98%.</p>\n\n<p>What happened? Well, the story is in the public record. (See, for example <a href=\"https://askgib.substack.com/p/a-brief-history-of-netflix-personalization\">this post</a> and <a href=\"https://askgib.substack.com/p/a-brief-history-of-netflix-personalization-31d\">this post</a> by Gibson Biddle.) In short, Netflix realized a bunch of things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>That they needed to concentrate everything on increasing subscriber revenue. And that the main goal of recommendations should be subscriber <em>retention</em>, or making sure people don\u2019t cancel.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>That the things people rate highly aren\u2019t always the same as what they actually <em>watch</em>. It\u2019s cool that you gave <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seventh_Seal\"><em>The Seventh Seal</em></a> five stars. But after a long day at work and finally getting the kids to bed, are you really going to choose <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Rublev_(film)\"><em>Andrei Rublev</em></a> over <em>The Great British Bachelorette and the Furious 7</em>?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>That to retain people, you need to get them started watching new stuff. Lots of people want to watch <em>Friends</em>, so Netflix will pay $100 million/year for <em>Friends</em>. But if you just join, binge every episode of <em>Friends</em>, and then cancel, that\u2019s bad. However, if the <em>Friends</em> button were to\u2014say\u2014randomly shift around in the interface, maybe while hunting for it you\u2019ll get hooked on some other (hopefully cheaper) shows and stick around longer.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>That beyond your explicit ratings, there are lots of implicit signals like what you watch, what you click on, what devices you use, and how long you stop scrolling when shown different kinds of thumbnails. These implicit signals are more useful than explicit rankings when predicting what to show you to keep you subscribed.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>That many people don\u2019t want to rate stuff. And (I speculate) that this provides a convenient excuse to drop the whole star rating system and replace it with the \u201cwhatever the hell order we want\u201d system that prevails today, where the match % means nothing and promises nothing.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Netflix could have kept the star ratings as some kind of optional feature for the nerds, hidden away in some dusty submenu. But they didn\u2019t. They 100% killed the star ratings for everyone. Why? I guess maintaining features takes work. But mostly I think they figured that most star rating diehard wouldn\u2019t actually quit the platform. They\u2019d grumble but accept the new system and thereby be Retained. And probably they were right.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I don\u2019t mean to vilify Netflix. Sure, it\u2019s an amoral automaton doing whatever maximizes profits. But this is hardly the worst example of algorithmic ranking, and hey, this is capitalism! If Netflix tried to be \u201cprincipled\u201d and stuck with star ratings, maybe some other company would have displaced them? Don\u2019t hate the player, hate the game? (Maybe don\u2019t hate the game either?)</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-algorithmic-ranking-should-be\">What algorithmic ranking should be</h2>\n\n<p>Let me summarize my argument so far:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Algorithmic ranking <em>as we know it</em> is designed to maximize money for the companies doing the ranking, duh.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>That\u2019s great if what you want is to be addicted or\u2014more precisely\u2014if your behavior happens to create incentives for rankings that are well-aligned with your goals in life. Otherwise, it\u2019s not.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Companies settled on these algorithms for a reason. It\u2019s not because they\u2019re evil, it\u2019s because this is what\u2019s profitable.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you accept all that, then what follows?</p>\n\n<p>One view is that this is further proof we must smash capitalism and end the malign power of the invisible hand. That\u2019s intellectually coherent, but not my style.</p>\n\n<p>Another view is that, well, this is the outcome of the market. It\u2019s pointless to fight the equilibrium, so we should just live with the algorithms. This is also not my style.</p>\n\n<p>A third view is that we must reject algorithmic ranking. Refuse to use any social media with algorithmic ranking. Subscribe to blogs using <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/feed.xml\">RSS</a>. Install browser extensions that block YouTube\u2019s recommendations. Chronological timelines only. Human curation only, forever.</p>\n\n<p>This third view <em>is</em> very much my style. One of the reasons I love blogging is that I can reach people without worrying about the damn algorithms. (Hi.) But I\u2019ve come to believe it\u2019s a dead end. After all, people <em>like</em> algorithmic ranking. Maybe with better interfaces or a bigger social movement, more people would shift towards human curation. But I suspect not that many, and the arc of history bends towards algorithms.</p>\n\n<p>And <em>good</em> algorithmic ranking\u2014which you <em>control</em>\u2014would be awesome.</p>\n\n<p>I mean, I appreciate that people subscribe to this blog. But I find it a little disturbing that if someone less well-known than me wrote the same thing, then many fewer people would read it. (I find it <em>extremely</em> disturbing that if someone more famous wrote it, then many more people would read it.) Yet that\u2019s an inevitable consequence of relying on subscriptions instead of algorithms.</p>\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t (only) an issue of vanity. I think it leads to an \u201cinvisible graveyard\u201d of contributions that never happen. Say you\u2019re a sane person who doesn\u2019t want to spend hours every week writing for strangers on the internet. But maybe you\u2019re\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014maybe you\u2019re on the board of your local volunteer fire department. And maybe you have one sizzling banger to write about how local volunteer fire department boards should be organized. That information is important! Reality is fractally complex! But probably you won\u2019t write it, because almost none of the people who\u2019d benefit from it will ever see it.</p>\n\n<p>I think the solution is to embrace algorithmic ranking, but insist on \u201ccontrol\u201d\u2014to insist that the algorithm serves your goals and not someone else\u2019s.</p>\n\n<p>How could that happen? In principle, we could all just refuse to use services without control. But I\u2019m skeptical this would work, because of rug-pulls. The same forces that made TikTok into TikTok will still exist and history is filled with companies providing control early on, getting a dominant position, and then taking the control away. Theoretically everyone could leave at that point, but that rarely seems to happen in practice.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, I think the control needs to be somehow \u201cbaked in\u201d from the beginning. There needs to be some kind of technological/legal/social structures in place that makes rug pulls impossible.</p>\n\n<p>What exactly should those structures be? And what <em>exactly</em> is \u201ccontrol\u201d, after all? I don\u2019t know! Those seem like difficult technical problems. But they don\u2019t seem <em>that</em> hard, do they? I suspect the main reason they haven\u2019t been solved is that we haven\u2019t tried very hard. We should do that.</p>\n\n<p>And\u2014I dare say\u2014we should do it quickly. My guess is that algorithmic <em>ranking</em> will soon become a sort of all-encompassing algorithmic <em>interface</em>. More about that soon, but if all the information that enters your brain is being filtered by an algorithm, it seems important that you know the algorithm is on your side.</p>\n\n<p><em>Thanks</em>: <a href=\"https://amistrongeryet.substack.com/\">Steve Newman</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/sebkrier\">S\u00e9b Krier</a></p>"

The codebase is intentionally simple and maintainable. The infrastructure is robust and redundant. Everything is backed up religiously (and then backed up again, just to be sure).</p>\n<p>I'm not just thinking about next week or next month. I'm thinking about Bear being around in 10, 20, 50 years. That means making smart technical choices now that won't paint Bear into a corner later.</p>\n<p>In this way, Bear doesn't have explicit integrations with other tools and infrastructure. It is self-reliant with the ability for users to customise their blogs and build out those integrations as they see fit. So while it is possible to integrate blogs with newsletter tools, Mastodon, Bluesky, and The Fediverse at large, it's not the default.</p>\n<h2 id=\"planning-for-the-future\">Planning for the future</h2><p>This is a morbid topic for me to write about: what happens to Bear if something happens to me? I've got that covered too. There's a detailed succession plan in place, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full documentation of all systems and processes</li>\n<li>Multiple trusted developers with access to the codebase</li>\n<li>Clear instructions for maintaining the platform</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So if I were to be incapacitated in any way, the platform will live on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"legal-structure\">Legal structure</h2><p>I've recently chatted to a few bloggers and legal professionals on what a good structure looks like for a project like this. And the common theme was that the legal structure didn't matter nearly as much as the intentions of the people running things. We've seen our fair share of open-source projects become sour (see the recent Wordpress drama) or abandoned entirely. We've seen OpenAI become ClosedAI. There's a common thread here. Trust isn't just a legal structure, but a social contract.</p>\n<p>With this is mind, Bear will continue to run as a PTY LTD where the company exchanges some extra add-ons for money, and uses that money to maintain and improve the infrastructure (and allows me to focus on Bear full time). Perhaps a more fitting legal structure will present itself in the future. If you have any ideas please pop me an email.</p>\n<p>I've also been thinking about what kinds of organisations last the longest, and there are a few that come to mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Small (usually family-owned) businesses</li>\n<li>Monasteries and convents</li>\n<li>Educational institutions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm not sure how this information is best applied, but it's telling that 'growth at all costs' inevitably leads to the dissolution of the company.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-bottom-line\">The bottom line</h2><p>Bear is doing great. Not in terms of market share or valuations, but in staying true to what matters: giving people a reliable, simple, and independent place to share their thoughts online.</p>\n<p>If you're tired of platforms that treat you like a product, welcome home. Bear is here to stay.</p>\n<p>Keep blogging,</p>\n<p>Herman Martinus<br />\nCreator of Bear</p>"

If you want a system that represents what\u2019s really going on, here we are.<br /><br />For example, take Basecamp\u2019s Hill Charts and Move The Needle features.

There are plenty of problems out there, an AI app is far from the only thing you can do.</p> <figure>  <source class=\"responsive-img-srcset\" /> <img class=\"img-fluid rounded z-depth-1\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://lukaspetersson.github.io/assets/img/wizard.png\" width=\"80%\" />  </figure> <p>Figure 1: Illustration of the fact that you are a wizard.</p> <p>Founders are wizards, pulling rabbits out of hats to create value where there seem to be none. Starting a company requires novel thinking. As PG put it:</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough just to be correct. Your ideas have to be both correct and novel (\u2026) You don\u2019t want to start a startup to do something that everyone agrees is a good idea.\u201d</p> <p>However, I think many founders have been blinded by the impressive revenue numbers of their peers. The quote above is from PG\u2019s essay \u201cHow to Think for Yourself\u201d. It is hard to think for yourself when everyone around you seems to all do the same thing, and that thing seems to be working. Below is my attempt. Hopefully, these ideas sound bad to you.</p> <p>I do believe that the horizontal agents that will dominate the AI application layer will be built by the AI labs. It is possible that model performance diverge leading to a single winner, but I think it is more likely that there will be fierce competition between Anthropic, OpenAI, GDM and xAI. This results in a race to the bottom where the end-users are the winners in the short term. Even if the AI labs won\u2019t capture much of the monetary value in the short term, I think they will be very powerful. So much so that I think it makes sense for founders to think about their startup in the context of their relationship to these labs.</p> <h2 id=\"customer\">Customer</h2> <p>As discussed in <a href=\"https://lukaspetersson.com/blog/2025/power-vertical/\">chapter 2</a>, I think it is possible to build an AI vertical which uses the LLM API\u2019s, but only if you have exclusive access to some crucial resource. If you insist on building an AI vertical, I think you should spend an enormous amount of effort trying to find such a resource.</p> <h2 id=\"competitor\">Competitor</h2> <p>If horizontal agents is the future, why not build one? Let\u2019s examine three possible approaches.</p> <p><strong>Being First to Market</strong></p> <p>AI labs will only compete seriously with vertical workflows once models are reliable enough to create horizontal agents with minimal engineering effort. You might theoretically beat the labs to be first to market by applying engineering effort to earlier models. But it is not certain. Leopold Aschenbrenner thinks this effort might take longer than building the next model:</p> <p>\u201c It seems plausible that the schlep will take longer than the unhobbling, that is, by the time the drop-in remote worker is able to automate a large number of jobs, intermediate models won\u2019t yet have been fully harnessed and integrated\u201d</p> <p>Regardless of who comes first, I don\u2019t expect this to last very long.</p> <p><strong>Agent API Wrapper</strong></p> <p>My roommate once asked: \u201cAre there no one with UI skills in the world?\u201d He wondered why nobody had built a better ChatGPT when the API to the model is available. This suggests two problems: 1) API costs make the margins unsustainable, and 2) labs don\u2019t release their best models (ChatGPT uses proprietary models for retrieval, web browsing etc).</p> <p>No one is competing directly with ChatGPT today using the GPT API, and I expect this pattern to repeat with horizontal agents.</p> <p><strong>Open-Source Models</strong></p> <p>Open-weight models might offer another path. Perplexity shows it\u2019s possible to compete with labs on a horizontal product. But while open-source models perform well on simple benchmarks, they struggle with complex agent tasks. Llama-3.1-405b lags significantly behind frontier models on MLE-bench (Figure 2). At Andon Labs, we specialize in these types of benchmarks and this matches what we see.</p> <figure>  <source class=\"responsive-img-srcset\" /> <img class=\"img-fluid rounded z-depth-1\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://lukaspetersson.github.io/assets/img/mleb.png\" width=\"100%\" />  </figure> <p>Figure 2, models compared on MLE-bench.</p> <p>I wrote this one month before publishing. In the meantime Deepseek V3 and R1 have been released with very impressive results. However, so was o3 (and Anthropic is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EH0VjM3dTk\">rumored</a> to have an even better version internally). We will continue to see open source models that come close to the frontier, but I doubt they will ever surpass. However, it might be good enough to compete in the horizontal game. Note that inference cost will still be very high.</p> <h2 id=\"vendor\">Vendor</h2> <p>If the AI labs really become this powerful, being a vendor to them is a great position. They will obviously need a lot of compute and power. Maybe even more than you think if Leo\u2019s analysis is correct (Figure 3). This opportunity requires industrial expertise, which might not come naturally for founders currently in the AI application layer. But remember what you are, a wizard.</p> <p>The labs also buy data from third parties. Scale AI is proving this to be a great business. However, the question mark here is whether AI labs can make \u201cself play\u201d work. AlphaZero was famously trained without any external data, and this is seen as the holy grail for future AI models. If they don\u2019t make self play work, the alternative will be to stitch multiple post training datasets together. In this world, selling data is probably a great bet!</p> <figure>  <source class=\"responsive-img-srcset\" /> <img class=\"img-fluid rounded z-depth-1\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://lukaspetersson.github.io/assets/img/leo_power.png\" width=\"60%\" />  </figure> <p>Figure 3, Projected American power generation compared to AI demand, speculated in Situational Awareness. Total electricity generation remains relatively flat while projected AI demand grows exponentially, potentially surpassing total current generation by 2030. The largest training cluster accounts for a significant portion of this demand.</p> <h2 id=\"ecosystem\">Ecosystem</h2> <p>A final relationship with AI labs worth examining is becoming an ecosystem contributor. This means building tools that help horizontal agents - but crucially, separated from the agents themselves. As Chapter 3 showed, traditional software will persist because agents need efficient interfaces. While agents could write their own software, the inference costs might make this impractical. However, ecosystem players risk becoming commodity, with most value captured elsewhere. I think this depends on how high the inference cost for running the horizontal agent is. If it is low, agents will more often prefer to write the software it needs itself.</p> <h2 id=\"what-if-the-timelines-are-longer\">What if the timelines are longer?</h2> <p>Timelines really matter - if horizontal agents take 10 years to become competitive, building a vertical workflow is a great idea. That\u2019s plenty of time to build a substantial company.</p> <p>10 years might be unreasonable given how fast labs are moving. But what about 4 years? While it might be too little time to build a huge company, it\u2019s enough time to iterate. Starting in the AI application layer might position you well to pivot into a vendor or ecosystem role later.</p> <h2 id=\"epilogue-ycs-bitter-lesson\">Epilogue: YC\u2019s Bitter Lesson?</h2> <p>At first glance, it seems YC is making a mistake. They seem to be making the majority of their investments in a space that will soon diminish. However, I don\u2019t understand venture capital well enough to make a confident statement. I am just venting my confusion here, please educate me.</p> <p>YC claims to be largely non-opinionated. They invest in the smartest people and hope that these people find the best ideas. This is a great strategy. Hundreds of founders will be better at predicting the details about the future than the 14 YC partners.</p> <p>Setting weekly goals is a big part of the batch. This is done in bigger groups, which is great for motivation. However, if the diversity of the ideas isn\u2019t big enough, it can lead to short term thinking. Doing an AI vertical is a great idea if your goal is to hit 5k MRR next week, but I don\u2019t think it is how you build a lasting business. But I am sure that I would be tempted to start one if I was in the current batch. Additionally, it seems like every episode of YC\u2019s podcast \u201cThe light cone\u201d advocates for AI verticals these days.</p> <p>I thought YC\u2019s non-opinionated strategy worked because of the inherent diversity, but maybe I am missing something.</p> <p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://x.com/axelbacklund\">Axel Backlund</a> for the discussions that led to this post.</p> <p>Follow me on <a href=\"https://x.com/lukaspet\">X</a> or subscribe via <a href=\"https://lukaspetersson.com/feed.xml\">RSS</a> to stay updated.</p>"

The moral impulse tells us to help our family, friends, and maybe village. It&#8217;s a weird misfire, analogous to an auto-immune disease, to waste brain cycles on starving children in a far-off country who you&#8217;ll never meet. You&#8217;ve been cucked by centuries of Christian propaganda. Instead of the slave morality that yokes you to loser victims who wouldn&#8217;t give you the time of day if your situations were reversed, you should cultivate a master morality that lets you love the strong people who push forward human civilization.</p><p>A younger and more naive person might think the based post-Christian vitalist and I have some <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/18/fundamental-value-differences-are-not-that-fundamental/\">irreconcilable moral difference</a>. Moral argument can only determine which conclusions follow from certain premises. If premises are too different (for example, a intuitive feeling of compassion for others, vs. an intuitive feeling of strength and pitilessness), there&#8217;s no way to proceed.</p><p>So it was revealing to watch some of these people trip over themselves to say we should invade Britain because of its tolerance for Pakistani grooming gangs.</p><p>In case you&#8217;ve been under a rock recently, in the early 2010s, several <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal\">organized child sexual assault rings</a> got busted in Britain - but only after the police spent years deliberately ignoring them, because the perpetrators were mostly Pakistani and busting them might seem racist. A recent legal dispute got them back in the news, and since social media is less censored now, the topic went viral in a way it didn&#8217;t before. Now the entire Right is demanding investigations, heads on pikes, and (in some cases) the American invasion of Britain.</p><p>Obviously this is extremely bad and they&#8217;re right to be angry. I criticized the media for not covering the Rotherham gangs more <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/10/16/five-case-studies-on-politicization/\">at the time</a>, and I&#8217;m glad they&#8217;re finally getting more attention. But since everyone else is talking about the criminal aspects of it, I hope it won&#8217;t be too inappropriate for me to make a philosophical point: all the people who claim a principled commitment to not caring about the suffering of poor kids in foreign countries suddenly care <em>a lot</em> about the suffering of poor kids in foreign countries.</p><p>Suddenly, they&#8217;ve stopped saying that capitalism solves every problem and since your solution isn&#8217;t capitalism you&#8217;re an idiot to even be considering it. I have heard zero demands that people who <em>really</em> care about grooming gangs have to stop talking about immigration policy or police malfeasance and focus on, I don&#8217;t know, investing in a startup working on better rape whistles. Once people care a lot about a problem, they naturally understand that - as great as capitalism is - you can&#8217;t leave everything to the free market.</p><p>Suddenly, they&#8217;ve stopped saying that every well-intentioned attempt to help another person will always backfire and end up causing incalculable harm. This is pretty impressive, because the official position of the British government is that any attempt to investigate or act against the gangs will backfire and cause incalculable harm. All the experts are begging you not to do it! But once people care a lot about a problem, they naturally understand that a vague possibility of poorly-spelled-out secondary consequences isn&#8217;t an excuse to tolerate atrocities.</p><p>Suddenly, they&#8217;ve stopped saying that if you help poor people with no particular skills, you&#8217;re a cuck who hates human greatness and wants to force the talented/deserving to spend all of their time in forced emotional subservience to their inferiors. Once people care a lot about a problem, they realize that you can try to help people who are suffering without it being some kind of demonic attack on everything noble and glorious in mankind.</p><p>Suddenly, they&#8217;ve stopped saying that if you ever acknowledge anything is bad and that we should act against bad things, your life will necessarily be destroyed by a crushing burden of obligation that requires you to spend all of your time and money (beyond that necessary for bare subsistence) on fighting evil. Once people care a lot about a problem, they are able to fit activism on that problem - even if it&#8217;s just a tweet expressing disgust, a petition against the people involved, or a small donation to victims - into their everyday lives without further disruption.</p><p>I&#8217;m not attacking these people&#8217;s position on grooming gangs. I think their position on grooming gangs is spot-on. I&#8217;m attacking their position <em>on everything else</em>.</p><p>I don&#8217;t think anyone is, deep down, a based post-Christian vitalist. It&#8217;s fun to LARP as the Nietzschean superman, but ask Raskolnikov how far that gets you. I think we all have the same basic moral impulses, and that for most people - including most people who deny it - those potentially include caring about poor people you&#8217;ll never meet, suffering in far-off countries.</p><p>I admit that we also <em>don&#8217;t</em> have moral impulses for a lot of other things. It&#8217;s hard to get as angry about kids suffering from some unpronounceable disease, as about kids suffering because a scary-looking person rapes them - even if the disease is horribly painful and disabling and terrifying, and realistically worse than the rape, and most people would pick the rape over the disease if they got a choice. </p><p>(if you&#8217;re going to get hung up on whether the suffering is because of a human bad actor or a natural cause, then can I interest you in donating to <a href=\"https://bedari.org.pk/about-us/\">Bedari</a>, a charity that prevents domestic abuse in the Third World? Most of their operations are in Pakistan, so you don&#8217;t even have to leave your comfort zone of being against Pakistani abusers in particular!)</p><p>My point is not that everyone starts life as a perfect altruist and later has to ineffectively repress it. My point is that we all start with a host of pretty similar albeit contradictory moral impulses and a drive to reconcile them, and our moral philosophies - rather than being handed to us by our genes - are downstream of the reconciliation process. You cannot do the reconciliation process through sheer logic (though logic helps), or through &#8220;doing the right thing&#8221; (since the process is upstream of knowing what the right thing is). All you can do is try to hit your intuitions off against each other and try to figure out what best maintains your dignity as a human being and doesn&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re trying to excise chunks of your soul. In the end, I think your choices are something like: </p><ol><li><p>Give up on ever being more than a bundle of incoherent preferences. Treat an issue as the world&#8217;s worst atrocity one day, and a nothingburger the next, depending on the level of media coverage, the exact wording of the story, and whose politics are getting flattered.</p></li><li><p>Keep coming up with more and more finely-sliced rules that you hope will separate the things you care about and the things you don&#8217;t into two different categories without requiring any changes to any of your beliefs or hard decisions. &#8220;Well, I care about people in my country, but not in other countries - oh, wait, the grooming scandal was in Britain but I still care about it - well, fine, I care about things done by bad people but not by Nature - oh, wait, ordinary domestic abuse is done by bad people - well, fine, I care about . . . &#8220; [I can&#8217;t predict what comes next, but nobody who tries this has ever run out of slices.]</p></li><li><p>Come up with arguments for why, miraculously, you have found yourself in the most convenient possible world, one where every attempt to help other people just makes their lives worse, and so you are forever excused from trying.</p></li><li><p><s>Resolve the contradiction by ceasing to care about child sexual assault victims or anyone else.</s> THIS IS NOT A REAL OPTION, SORRY.</p></li><li><p>Admit, kicking and screaming, that you might be a good person. Do some moral philosophy to see if this implies anything. If you find that it implies things you don&#8217;t want to do, or don&#8217;t have enough willpower to do, admit that you might be a <em>sort of</em> good person who is <em>vaguely</em> in favor of good things, but doesn&#8217;t have infinite willpower, and realistically will not be carrying them out most days (this is approximately everyone). Keep doing moral philosophy and testing it against your values and motivations until you reach <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_equilibrium\">reflective equillibrium</a> (haha, as if).</p></li></ol><p>I don&#8217;t think you have to strain or lie or tie yourself into moral knots to justify being angry at child sexual exploitation in Rotherham. I think this is natural because there&#8217;s a part of you - the best part - which cares about suffering and injustice wherever in the world it happens, even in foreign countries, even to poor people who you&#8217;ll never meet. </p><p>I think the straining and lying and knots come in when you try to <em>deny</em> that part and say &#8220;Oh, no, who, me? I definitely don&#8217;t care about the suffering of the world at all&#8221; while hastily burying your heart bursting with wisdom and compassion for all mankind under the bedsheets where we can&#8217;t see it. </p>"
