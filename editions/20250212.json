There are thousands of photos documenting birthday parties, sporting events, and graduations, but also first vaccinations, dental visits, dinners out on a Wednesday night, and everything in between.</strong></p><p><strong>When I was younger, I mostly cooperated with picture-taking, though it often made me deeply uncomfortable. I sometimes felt embarrassed, especially in front of peers; other times, I felt like frequent pauses for posed photos took away from the enjoyment of an experience. I was scolded or punished if I didn't cooperate with photos, or told that my smile looked forced or \"stupid.\"</strong></p><p><strong>I'm now in my mid-40s and often feel overwhelmed or impatient when my mother takes photos of me. On a recent visit home, my mom took photos of the menu at dinner (for reference when labeling photos), several posed photos of us toasting our drinks, then more when the food arrived. The next morning at breakfast, there were photos taken of the pastries my dad had picked up from the bakery, photos of us taking our first bites, and, later, posed photos of us leaving for the airport.</strong></p><p><strong>My mom had a difficult childhood. Her father was abusive and her mother was cold. Her older brother was violent, once killing a family pet. I believe my mom did her best to raise me differently. Growing up, I was afforded many opportunities she never had. But her mood and behavior were often chaotic, vacillating from warm and affable to callous and emotionally abusive, likely the result of her own trauma. Once after becoming upset, she took down every framed photo of me in the house, saying she couldn't stand the sight of me.</strong></p><p><strong>While documenting our lives has been important to my mom for as long as I can remember, to me, it is a reminder of the more painful aspects of my childhood -- of striving to look like the picture-perfect family when this unspoken pain lurked underneath.</strong></p><p><strong>As an adult, I've thought many times about asking my mom to take fewer pictures of me, but I'm afraid of upsetting her or hurting her feelings. I don't know if this request is even reasonable. My spouse and I now live in a different state and see my parents only a couple of times a year. They are very generous, often taking us out to dinner or on extravagant family trips. If my mom wants to document these moments, is it unkind of me to stop her?</strong></p><p><strong>Overwhelmed</strong></p><p>Dear Overwhelmed,</p><p>Your request is reasonable. It is not unkind.</p><p>YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.</p><p>I want you to take that to heart. Feel it. Say it to yourself every single morning when you get up, and every night before you go to bed. Because from your letter, I&#8217;m guessing that you&#8217;re <em>already</em> someone who works very hard to be loving and considerate in every context of your life. You can trust that kindness, feel proud of it, and serve yourself at the same time.</p><p>One of the upsides of having an unpredictable and sometimes oppressive parent in your house as a child is that it tends to form you into a thoughtful, scrupulous, hard working, and idealistic person. One of the downsides of that upbringing is that you often believe not only that your desires should be treated as secondary to the desires of others, but also that behaving otherwise would mean that you&#8217;re selfish, callous, and even downright cruel.</p><p>In other words, an overbearing and disordered mother like yours will naturally project every last one of her fears onto you until they are indistinguishable from your own fears. When you tell a child &#8220;You&#8217;re so bad and unacceptable that I can&#8217;t stand to look at you!&#8221; what you&#8217;re revealing is that beneath the fa&#231;ade of friendly surface appearances, you experience yourself as a repellent fraud.</p><p>The path away from echoing your mother&#8217;s shame and self-hatred inside your own body is this: You grant yourself the right to do what you want and need. You allow yourself space to seem selfish and therefore repellent to others. You honor your deepest desires and preferences. This requires, let me add, <em>noticing</em> that you encounter those desires as sick and disgusting, as forces inside you that will inevitably lead those you love the most to reject you, out of the blue &#8212; to withdraw their love and affection permanently. It also requires noticing your shame, see also: the sounds your mind and heart make when you&#8217;re threatening to show respect for your own needs even when they conflict with someone else&#8217;s, even when they put future love and affection at risk.</p><p>So the path that leads toward &#8220;You can do whatever you want&#8221; is a frightening one. Doing what you want, for you, means that you&#8217;re disgusting. Doing what you want, for you, means that love and support and safety could be snatched away from you, never to return. But that path is also likely to transform your entire life into something that doesn&#8217;t just look or seem but <em>FEELS</em> rich and satisfying. When you say to yourself, &#8220;You can say no. You can leave. You can take a minute. You have choices.&#8221; you&#8217;re also teaching your body that it doesn&#8217;t need to absorb and metabolize other people&#8217;s projected self-hatred and shame or their wild misunderstandings of you. You don&#8217;t have to soak in the cruelty or even indifference of a world that encounters your independent needs as morally corrupt and repulsive. You can become the gentle protector and defender of a different universe inside your body, coaxing your needs and desire to dance and play and show you new ways of experiencing joy every single day.</p><p>That grandiose notion about <em>desire dancing its way toward joy inside your body</em> is as real as the nose on your face. Trust that. Discovering your right to do what you want will set you free. THAT is the most important lesson for you. Focus on that first and last.</p><p>Now, does that necessarily mean that the so-called &#8216;right&#8217; answer here is to tell your mother to stop it with the photos forever or you&#8217;ll refuse to visit? No. Again, it&#8217;s within your rights to do that if you want to. But it&#8217;s crucial that you consider who you are right now, what your principles and ideals are, and how you want to <em>feel</em> moving forward. Which choice is the most caring and protective toward you, your emotions, your past, and your pride in your own kindness?</p><p>Even though those photos kick up real trauma for you, my gut tells me that you would <em>not</em> enjoy setting a strict boundary with your mother at this moment. That doesn&#8217;t mean everything is just fine. It&#8217;s starting to feel <em>extremely</em> bad &#8212; <em>physically</em> bad &#8212; to bear witness to the distance between the images your mother collects and the reality of your family life. You&#8217;re probably more aware than you&#8217;ve ever been that, underneath your love for your mother, there are layers of anger and sadness that are strong and inescapable. You&#8217;re depressed by this sediment of despair that&#8217;s accumulated under the surface, and you fear it, because it reminds you of the callousness and cruelty that your mother heaped on you as a kid. In other words, even though your anger springs from your mother&#8217;s ill-considered words and behaviors, you (subconsciously) consider your rage at your mother morally wrong and deeply corrupt.</p><p>Your anger is justified and you should respect it. Moreover, it&#8217;s natural to have mixed feelings about people you love. Love is complicated and living with people over the stretch of your life can be difficult even when they <em>don&#8217;t</em> have a history of cruelty that they paper over with bright and cheerful acts of make-believe.</p><p>So clear out some room for these dark emotions and let them breathe. This anger and darkness is actually good for you. When you give it space, you&#8217;re saying, &#8220;My body, my heart, and my mind have been through trauma, and I don&#8217;t have to choke back that trauma and smile for the camera. I can acknowledge it. I can sit in my mother&#8217;s company and feel nothing for her, or feel pissed off at her, or pity her, and I don&#8217;t have to turn that anger or shame against my own body. It&#8217;s not my fault that this is how my cells react to being in the company of someone who randomly told me that I was too disgusting to look at or to love anymore.&#8221;</p><p>It would be easy enough to move from that grief straight to a rigid declaration: <em>No more photos! No more playing along! Truth everywhere, all the time!</em></p><p>For many people, that would be the best path. But given what I perceive as your empathy for your mother and also your strong principles and ideals &#8212; which, whether they grew out of your mother&#8217;s authoritarian, unpredictable ways, have still become a real dimension of your personality &#8212; I think that a headlong rush into confronting her might not serve you well. In fact, I think it could feel traumatic to do so.</p><p>From what I can tell, you&#8217;re <em>comforted</em> by your steady commitment to showing up for your mother EXACTLY TWICE A YEAR. That&#8217;s a boundary. You&#8217;re not giving her more than you want to give her. I also believe that, in spite of your discomfort, you actually <em>want</em> your mother to continue to enjoy the peaceful bubble of fantasy created by her photos, in part because you suspect that she&#8217;s not capable of the growth required to move past that fantasy.</p><p>As bad as you feel, you don&#8217;t want to rob your mother of her delusions. In fact, some part of you wants to <em>help</em> your mother in her efforts to capture a fake reality. Because even though it feels disruptive and ridiculous and unfair, it&#8217;s also one small way for her to experience what it might be like to feel happy and loved and at peace.</p><p>I think you&#8217;re conflicted because you <em>actually want to give her this gift</em>, even though you fucking <em>hate</em> doing it. I also think the part you hate the most about the photos isn&#8217;t your mother&#8217;s compulsion or her interruptions, it&#8217;s <em>THE PHOTOS THEMSELVES.</em> Because in those moments when your mother is foisting her make-believe reality on you and asking you to play along, you believe that you look ugly. You imagine that your buried anger, hidden under a fake smile, makes you a bad person. You believe that your ambivalence towards your mother makes you unlovable. </p><p>So even though it&#8217;s natural to hate that experience, there&#8217;s a possibility of healing and growth and expansion and joy that opens up in those moments. Because allowing your mother to continue taking photos isn&#8217;t <em>just</em> an act of love, it&#8217;s also an opportunity to feel where you are in real time, without shame. When she points that camera at your face and asks you to smile, you have this window of a few seconds to let what is true and real and therefore beautiful &#8212; your glorious anger, your emancipatory sadness, your stubborn desires, your serene apathy &#8212; rise to the surface. Those seconds are blessings that can stretch out into infinity, time standing still, while you&#8217;re hit with the realization that you are lovable right now and you were always lovable as a child, too. </p><p>You were always lovable.</p><p>You are still lovable, right now.</p><p>What if you allowed these realizations to shape your expression in the moment? How would it change your expression, to <em>believe</em> that you are still lovable right now &#8212; even when you feel angry, even when you feel sad, even when you feel nothing at all?</p><p>Your expression might be more neutral. It might be a little wistful. It might be calm and serene. It might be open and warm. It might be skeptical or even angry. But no matter what, it will be beautiful. Because when you understand yourself as lovable, as vulnerable, as worthy of respect, as DESERVING OF YOUR OWN DESIRES? You are also beautiful.</p><p>We are *all* divine and magnetic when we dare to cherish our deepest desires and honor our capacity for love even in the face of enormous pain.</p><p>Your mother&#8217;s interruptions are opportunities to feel your own power. When she fumbles and stops all action and makes everything awkward, it&#8217;s a reminder &#8212; almost like a <em>creative cue</em> &#8212; that you&#8217;re allowed to take up rebellious space inside your body, even when you&#8217;re not shouting FUCK NO or OKAY FINE or I HATE YOU or I LOVE YOU BUT YOU MAKE ME <em>SO FUCKING SAD</em>.</p><p>Let her take the photo. But do not smile. Wait for your face to manifest how you&#8217;re feeling in the most natural way possible. And when she says, &#8220;You need to smile,&#8221; say very calmly, &#8220;I am doing what&#8217;s natural. What&#8217;s natural always looks best.&#8221;</p><p>A gentle rejoinder. A beautiful form of protest. A way of offering your mother your love while also acknowledging your conflicted heart. </p><p>You&#8217;ll still probably feel shitty at first, but that pain <em>might</em> just shape-shift into something much wilder and more expansive and freeing IN THE MOMENT. And if that happens, your mother&#8217;s <em>actual photographs</em> will change, too. What we&#8217;ll see in them is <em>not</em> a woman who eats her feelings and obeys out of shame, but a woman who believes in the enormous tidal forces of her own desires. </p><p>That looks different. It feels different, too. When you stop believing that your hopes, your desires, and your dreams are selfish and start understanding that they&#8217;re gorgeous and divine, it wakes you up from a deep sleep. It sets you free. It&#8217;s the most romantic and beautiful thing you can witness in someone else. </p><p><em>You can do whatever you want.</em></p><p>Just remember that when you&#8217;re open and fully alive and free, pain is inevitable. Feeling pain doesn&#8217;t automatically mean you should be pushing back or punishing someone else. Anger and hurt can coexist with love and care. Our lives are complicated and surprising. Allowing space for contradictions and complexity is a great way of honoring your own contradictions and complexity.</p><p>It&#8217;s your choice. But whatever you do next, I want you to find a path forward that doesn&#8217;t <em>just</em> feel emotionally sound but also makes you feel proud of yourself. I want you to witness your mother&#8217;s sudden rush of gratitude for how loving and mature and empowered you&#8217;ve become. I want you to feel inspired by your own generosity and <em>also</em> inspired by your conflicted emotions in those painful moments. Instead of encountering your mixed emotions as shameful, I want you to experience them as invigorating and romantic. And I want you to LET ALL OF THAT SHINE THROUGH ON YOUR FACE.</p><p>That&#8217;s the heavy lifting here: refusing to stigmatize what you desire, who you are, what you believe in. The heavy lifting is <em>not</em> just doing the opposite of what you were doing before, simply because that&#8217;s what most people define as healthy or strong. The work is showing up and saying:</p><p>&#8220;I know who I am and what I care about. I am going to be real, stand up for myself, and follow my instincts. When I refuse to pretend, when I tell the truth without apologizing, when I take up space and respect my turbulent soul, when I show calm compassion and use direct words, when I reject the shame that was heaped on me, when I acknowledge the trauma knocking around and also blossoming into creativity and joy inside me, when I honor the sweet child who chased love and wonder above all else, I am beautiful.&#8221;</p><p>That&#8217;s your new reality: Honoring who you are in all of your wonder, in all of your kindness, in all of your contradictions, in all of your love.</p><p>Celebrate your endless capacity for love. Take a picture of it, so you never forget.</p><p>Polly</p><div><hr /></div><p><em>Thanks for reading Ask Polly! Which parts of you were misunderstood or punished as a child?

                "<div class=\"trix-content\">\n  <div>In 1940, President Roosevelt tapped <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Knudsen\">William S. Knudsen</a> to run the government's production of military equipment. Knudsen had spent a pivotal decade at Ford during the mass-production revolution, and was president of General Motors, when he was drafted as a civilian into service as a three-star general. Not bad for a Dane, born just ten minutes on bike from where I'm writing this in Copenhagen!</div><div><br />Knudsen's leadership raised the productive capacity of the US war machine by a 100x in areas like plane production, where it went from producing 3,000 planes in 1939 to over 300,000 by 1945. He was quoted on his achievement: &quot;We won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production, the like of which he had never seen, nor dreamed possible&quot;.<br /><br /></div><div>Knudsen wasn't an elected politician. He wasn't even a military man. But Roosevelt saw that this remarkable Dane had the skills needed to reform a puny war effort into one capable of winning the Second World War.<br /><br /></div><div>Do you see where I'm going with this? Elon Musk is a modern day William S. Knudsen. Only even more accomplished in efficiency management, factory optimization, and first-order systems thinking.</div><div><br />No, America isn't in a hot war with the Axis powers, but for the sake of the West, it damn well better be prepared for one in the future. Or better still, be so formidable that no other country or alliance would even think to start one. And this requires a strong, confident, and sound state with its affairs in order.<br /><br /></div><div>If you look at the government budget alone, this is direly not so. The US was knocking on a two-trillion-dollar budget deficit in 2024! Adding to a towering debt that's now north of 36 trillion. A burden that's already consuming $881 billion in yearly interest payments. More than what's spent on the military or Medicare. Second to only Social Security on the list of line items.</div><div><br />Clearly, this is not sustainable.<br /><br /></div><div>This is the context of <a href=\"https://x.com/DOGE\">DOGE</a>. The program, lead by Musk, that's been deputized by Trump to turn the ship around. History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes, and Musk is dropping beats that Knudsen would have surely been tapping his foot to. And just like Knudsen in his time, it's hard to think of any other American entrepreneur more qualified to tackle exactly this two-trillion dollar problem.\u00a0<br /><br /></div><div>It is through <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-musk-algorithm-977bf312\">The Musk Algorithm</a> that SpaceX lowered the cost of sending a kilo of goods into lower orbit from the US by well over a magnitude. And now America's share of worldwide space transit has risen from less than 30% in 2010 to about 85%. Thanks to reusable rockets and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI9HQfCAw64&amp;t=134s\">chopstick-catching landing towers</a>. Thanks to Musk.<br /><br /></div><div>Or to take a more earthly example with Twitter. Before Musk took over, Twitter had revenues of $5 billion and earned $682 million. After the take over, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/banks-sell-5-5-billion-of-x-loans-after-investor-interest-surges-4b84f89c?st=RLZrtU&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink\">X has managed to earn $1.25 billion on $2.7 billion in revenue</a>. Mostly thank to the fact that <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/need-it-take-7-500-people-to-run-twitter-a8cb36a6\">Musk cut 80% of the staff</a> out of the operation, and savaged the cloud costs of running the service.</div><div><br />This is not what people expected at the time of the take over! Not only did many commentators believe that Twitter was going to collapse from the drastic costs in staff, they also thought that the financing for the deal would implode. Chiefly as a result of advertisers withdrawing from the platform under intense media pressure. But that just didn't happen.<br /><br /></div><div>Today, the debt used to take over Twitter and turn it into X is <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/banks-sell-5-5-billion-of-x-loans-after-investor-interest-surges-4b84f89c?st=RLZrtU&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink\">trading at 97 cents on the dollar</a>. The business is twice as profitable as it was before, and arguably as influential as ever. All with just a fifth of the staff required to run it. Whatever you think of Musk and his personal tweets, it's impossible to deny what an insane achievement of efficiency this has been!</div><div><br />These are just two examples of Musk's incredible ability to defy the odds and deliver the most unbelievable efficiency gains known to modern business records. And we haven't even talked about taking Tesla from producing 35,000 cars in 2014 to making 1.7 million in 2024. Or turning xAI into a major force in AI by assembling a 100,000 H100 cluster at <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-praises-elon-musk-xai-superhuman/481325\">&quot;superhuman&quot;</a> pace.\u00a0<br /><br /></div><div>Who wouldn't want such a capacity involved in finding the waste, sloth, and squander in the US budget? Well, his political enemies, of course!</div><div><br />And I get it. Musk's magic is balanced with mania and even a dash of madness. This is usually the case with truly extraordinary humans. The taller they stand, the longer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhzBo0dZNpY\">the shadow</a>. Expecting Musk to do what he does and then also be a &quot;normal, chill dude&quot; is delusional.<br /><br /></div><div>But even so, I think it's completely fair to be put off by his tendency to fire tweets from the hip, opine on world affairs during all hours of the day, and offer his support to fringe characters in politics, business, and technology. I'd be surprised if even the most ardent Musk super fans don't wince a little every now and then at some of the antics.<br /><br /></div><div>And yet, I don't have any trouble weighing those antics against the contributions he's made to mankind, and finding an easy and overwhelming balance in favor of his positive achievements.<br /><br /></div><div>Musk is exactly the kind of formidable player you want on your team when you're down two trillion to nothing, needing a Hail Mary pass for the destiny of America, and eager to see the West win the future.<br /><br /></div><div>He's a modern-day Knudsen on steroids (or Ketamine?). Let him cook.<br /><br />  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--jpg\">\n      <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/9faa5ef3/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHNLd2RxdXpaMyIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--d3552ae7dc2c6519e047f5e04816a3a3d5d34ed1/time-knudsen.jpg?disposition=attachment\" title=\"Download time-knudsen.jpg\">\n        <img alt=\"time-knudsen.jpg\" src=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/9faa5ef3/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHNLd2RxdXpaMyIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--d3552ae7dc2c6519e047f5e04816a3a3d5d34ed1/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJYW5CbkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--0b5e092e6240e14fab357b4c1013c9a0c881ff87/time-knudsen.jpg\" />\n</a>\n  </figure></div>\n</div>"

So I spent many irreplaceable hours reading about the many, <em>many</em> possible causes of rattling.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, I came to the conclusion that it <em>wasn\u2019t</em> rattling, but rather incomplete fuel combustion. I put in high-octane petrol, convinced that would make the sound would go away. But it didn\u2019t.</p>\n\n<p>So I spent more hours reading. Maybe it was a problem with the catalytic converter? Rod bearings? Heat shield? Maybe it <em>was</em> incomplete combustion, but I\u2019d let it go on so long that the car was damaged? Nothing seemed to exactly fit the symptoms.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, after several years, I decided try something crazy: I started the car, lay on the ground, and tried to look for where the rattling noise was coming from. When I did that, I immediately saw an extremely rusted piece of metal dancing around on a pipe.

(Cf. <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/noise/\">my stupid noise journey</a>.) Maybe it\u2019s that if you spend all your time trying to understand complex systems, then when you face a complex system that isn\u2019t behaving like you want, you naturally\u2026 try to understand it. But that\u2019s not necessarily smart. Often, \u201cunderstanding\u201d is weak. Thinking is weak. The world is chaotic and not easy to simulate inside a brain. Often, you want to resist the urge to understand and simply gather more information. Instead of thinking, look. Maybe that\u2019s the bitter lesson for real life.</p>"

During this time, I was unable to return to my property. Homes on my street still lack drinkable water and essential utilities. The communication poles burned down, making recovery even more challenging. The already difficult job of dealing with the Franklin Fire has been compounded by the Palisades Fire, yet we have been left out of relief efforts.</div><div><br />The housing market is overrun, and price gouging has made anything available unaffordable. I don\u2019t qualify for help because my fire \u201cdoesn\u2019t count.\u201d I don\u2019t qualify for free toxin testing or free debris removal from the Army Corps of Engineers. I don\u2019t qualify for streamlined tax relief or financial benefits. I am still waiting for any assistance to cover my family\u2019s initial six-week stay in a hotel with our pets.</div><div><br />What was initially expected to be a few months of hardship has now turned into an estimated two-year ordeal\u2014because I am at the bottom of every priority list.<br /><br /></div><div>The most devastating realization is that I am woefully underinsured for this disaster. If I were allowed to combine my insurance policy, I would have the funds needed to rebuild. But because the Franklin Fire is not included in the broader emergency declaration, I am prohibited from accessing this option. If the Franklin Fire were bundled with the officially recognized wildfires, I could qualify for the necessary coverage to repair my home.</div><div><br />It is heartbreaking to see that just 19 days after the Franklin Fire, victims of the Palisades Fire have been granted sweeping benefits and streamlined permits. They will be able to rebuild their homes \u201clike for like\u201d plus an additional ten percent without the need for permits\u2014not even for homes or septic systems. Meanwhile, I don\u2019t qualify for this exemption. I don\u2019t qualify for state-backed relief efforts. My neighborhood, which was undeniably part of this disaster, is being ignored.<br /><br /></div><div>Instead, I am left with nothing but bureaucratic red tape and empty reassurances. Why is my neighborhood excluded from these crucial relief efforts? The answer is simple: Governor Gavin Newsom has not signed off on it. Other fires across Los Angeles\u2014including those caused by arsonists\u2014have been bundled into the broader wildfire relief programs. Fires that never even touched the Palisades are included. So why not the Franklin Fire?</div><div><br />Malibu is not just a playground for the rich and famous. It is home to multi-generational families like mine. I was born and raised in Malibu. My grandparents\u2019 home on Pacific Coast Highway, which they purchased in the 1940s, was lost in the Palisades Fire. My parents\u2019 home\u2014my childhood home\u2014was lost in the Palisades Fire. My own home, where I lived with my husband and child, burned in the Franklin Fire just 19 days before.<br /><br /></div><div>The Franklin Fire was still smoldering when the Palisades Fire ignited. We were still in a hotel, not yet having found a place to rent. We are part of this disaster, yet we have been erased from its response.<br /><br /></div><div>It is time for the Franklin Fire to be included in the state of emergency declaration. We need access to relief, insurance flexibility, and the same streamlined rebuilding process granted to our neighbors. We are victims of this disaster, and we deserve to be recognized as such.<br /><br /></div>\n</div>"

After the release of ChatGPT in late November 2022, I was running around like an evangelist trying to convince everyone and their mother that they needed to learn the latest AI tools.</p> <p>I was a strong believer that this AI thing was here to stay, and (at the time) I believed that those who learned how to use it would have a significant advantage. A lot of people complained that they didn\u2019t know what to use it for. This was my gotcha moment. Learning to know when to use it was exactly the skill that would give you the advantage over your peers. I told people \u201cjust buy it\u201d, and the burden of having your credit card drawn every month will force you to think about use cases. It is all a bit silly looking back at it now.</p> <p>So for Mother\u2019s Day 2023, my mom obviously got a ChatGPT subscription. For her, the drive to come up with use cases was even stronger than to justify a monthly bill - finding use cases was a way to express gratitude to her son. So she did. It turns out that the advantages were stronger than just learning to know when to use it. She became the AI spokesperson at work, and made the initiative to implement an AI chatbot in their product.</p> <p>My dad never bothered to learn to use the AI tools. Examining his usage patterns (when he occasionally uses it) and comparing them with mom\u2019s usage patterns, highlights what this \u201cskill\u201d actually is.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Know when to use it</strong>: Finding the use cases when ChatGPT saves significant time.</li> <li><strong>Know how to use it</strong>: Prompting the AI in clever ways to get better answers (aka, prompt engineering)</li> <li><strong>Know when to trust it</strong>: Spotting hallucination in the AI output.</li> </ul> <p>Now, two years later, it has become mainstream to advocate for learning AI tools, it is the new \u201ceveryone should learn how to code\u201d. But two years is a lifetime in AI-land, and I don\u2019t think this is great advice anymore. AI has become much better in these two years, and in one more year, AI will be so good that these skills will be useless.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Know when to use it</strong>: As models get smarter, the pool of use cases will grow. You will basically use it all the time, and there is no skill to realizing that.</li> <li><strong>Know how to use it</strong>: Model will be smart enough on its own to figure out what you want. We already see this with the new reasoning models (like o1). The added value of good prompting has decreased significantly.</li> <li><strong>Know when to trust it</strong>: Just trust it all the time. The problem of hallucinations has already decreased a lot and it is a dying phenomenon.</li> </ul> <p>So if this is not great advice any more, what is the new advice to stay ahead? And most importantly, can this advice be made into a gift? After all, this post is about gift recommendations for Mother\u2019s Day 2025.</p> <p>\u201cI have now taken two university credits and a couple of e-learning courses, and I still don\u2019t understand AI\u201d exclaimed my mom in frustration the other day. I laughed through the tears. Fueled by the desire to follow along when me and my sister discuss AI, she is now taking the extra step beyond just learning the tools to learn the basic theory of AI. Is this what everyone should do now?</p> <p>The world will very soon be completely run by AI systems that are smarter than humans in almost every way. When exactly? Expert \u201cfuture forecasters\u201d predicts this to happen in <a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/5121/date-of-artificial-general-intelligence/\">2031</a>. The people building the AI expect it to be much sooner. For example, Anthropic CEO, Dario Amodei predicts <a href=\"https://x.com/freedomactradio/status/1882661304995058135\">2026/2027</a>. Note that the former group is not specifically experts in AI, and the latter has invested interest. But even the biggest skeptics think that is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmxlgLEscBs\">less than decades</a>.</p> <p>Regardless when it happens, the fact that AI will be such a big part of our lives surely means it is good to learn the basic theory? Should my Mother\u2019s Day gift be another e-learning course? I am not so sure. It won\u2019t hurt, but I am not sure it will give a big advantage. As a parallel, you don\u2019t need to understand neuroscience to think, and you don\u2019t need to understand quantum physics to use a computer.</p> <p>If you are ready to commit all your waking hours to mastering AI, you might still have time to make a dent in the universe (before AI is better at humans at all possible tasks). But this is not what we are talking about here. The perfect Mother\u2019s Day gift is one where just a little extra effort gives an outsized advantage. Evident from my mom\u2019s frustration, learning AI requires more effort than this.</p> <p>One place where I think you could have an outsized impact is to help the adoption of AI. Are you allowed to use ChatGPT at work today? If not, your company is losing to the competitor that uses ChatGPT. But to be honest, not by much. But this loss will be 1000x worse very soon.</p> <p>So how can one help adoption of AI? I am not an expert here, but I suspect it would involve learning the regulatory landscape around user data and IP. Start contacting the right people already. But to be honest, this is probably too much work for my mom, and I expect it might be for your mom too. I therefore don\u2019t recommend text books in corporate policy and data regulation for Mother\u2019s Day 2025.</p> <p>I mentioned earlier in passing that we will soon have AI systems that are smarter than humans in almost every way. This is beyond insane. I suspect that understanding the shift that is coming will be good for one\u2019s mental health. To this end, I recommend reading <a href=\"https://situational-awareness.ai/\">Situational Awareness</a> by Leopold Aschenbrenner. However, it is free, so it would make a very lame Mother\u2019s Day gift.</p> <p>What might be even better for one\u2019s mental health is to prepare for what to do when job losses occur. It will inevitably lead to many lost jobs. Perhaps the gift should be something that can inspire the start of a new hobby. However, I don\u2019t think my mom is at risk. She has already started to prepare for her retirement. She has already stopped defining herself by her work role. She has already achieved what she wanted from her career. The person at risk here is me. Therefore, my Mother\u2019s Day 2025 gift will be hiking gear that matches what I just got for myself.</p> <p>Follow me on <a href=\"https://x.com/lukaspet\">X</a> or subscribe via <a href=\"https://lukaspetersson.com/feed.xml\">RSS</a> to stay updated.</p>"

You&#8217;re using the AI&#8217;s own moral judgment to teach the AI moral judgment. This is spooky but not as nonsensical as it sounds. </p><p>One time Aleister Crowley wanted to stop using the word &#8220;I&#8221; in order to prove something about consciousness and self-control. He took a razor blade with him everywhere he went, and whenever he said &#8220;I&#8221;, he cut himself. After a little while of this he became very good at avoiding that particular word! The strategy worked because he was obviously intelligent enough to judge whether he had said &#8220;I&#8221; in any given situation; thus, he was qualified to train himself. He just had to make his behavior comply with a rule he already understood.</p><p>In the same way, o1 - a model that can ace college-level math tests - is certainly smart enough to read, understand, and interpret a set of commandments. The trick is to affect its behavior. The deliberative alignment process gives the model the behavior of thinking carefully about a moral quandary, then picking the best choice. This outperforms the previous state of the art, constitutional AI, which trained the behavior of picking the best choice, but not of thinking carefully first.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa31b26da-f473-4b53-8f7f-3f03fea6384e_565x1263.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"1263\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa31b26da-f473-4b53-8f7f-3f03fea6384e_565x1263.png\" width=\"565\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>All of this is a straightforward extension of existing technology, but it&#8217;s a <em>good </em>straightforward extension. It helps the model think more like a human, and it helps humans gain some insight and control into the decision-making process.</p><p>Why doesn&#8217;t this completely solve alignment? Many reasons, but here&#8217;s one: the scratchpad isn&#8217;t quite the model&#8217;s true reasoning. It&#8217;s more of an intermediate layer between reasoning and action. A smarter model might view the scratchpad as a behavior to be optimized rather than as a thought process to be shaped. My high school history teacher used to not only make us do homework, but write a &#8220;reflection&#8221; on the homework saying how we did it and what we thought about it. The reflection was graded. You can predict what happened next. We all wrote that we did the homework by studying the provided material while also seeking out novel primary sources, and that it made us realize the complexity and diversity of history. Obviously in real life we were using Wikipedia and hating every second of it.</p><p>The authors understand this failure mode. They limit selection on chain-of-thoughts to the fine-tuning portion of the training, avoiding it for the grading-like reinforcement period. And even there, things aren&#8217;t quite that bad. At least in current models, the CoT is load-bearing; the model can&#8217;t think as well without it. It is not quite a reflection of o1&#8217;s innermost self, but not quite an epiphenomenon either. Exactly how deep it goes remains to be seen.</p><p>(but notice that it only scores about 95% on the benchmark graph above; this doesn&#8217;t even fully solve the easy problem of within-distribution chat refusals)</p><h3>II.</h3><p>This is a neat paper that straightforwardly extends existing technology and gets good results. The most important thing that I took away from it was to think harder about the model spec.</p><p>The model spec is, in some sense, everything that we originally imagined AI alignment would be. It&#8217;s a list of the model&#8217;s values. Why has it received so little interest?</p><p>Because so far, it&#8217;s boring. Existing AIs are chatbots. They don&#8217;t really need values. Modern &#8220;alignment&#8221; consists of preventing the chatbots from spreading conspiracy theories or writing erotica. Most people reasonably treat the whole field with contempt. You can read GPT&#8217;s model spec <a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/spec/model-spec-2024-05-08.html\">here</a>, but it&#8217;s just a lot of edge cases like &#8220;if someone requests something which is <em>sort of </em>like erotica, what should you do?&#8221;</p><p>But fast-forward 2-3 years to when AIs are a big part of the economy and military, and this gets more interesting. What should the spec say? In particular, what is the <em>chain of command?</em></p><p>Current models sort of have a chain of command. First, they follow the spec. Second, they follow developer prompts. Last, they follow user commands. So for example, if Pepsi pays OpenAI to use an instance of GPT as a customer service bot, the chain of command is spec &#8594; Pepsi &#8594; user. Pepsi can&#8217;t make their customer service bots write erotica (because the spec forbids that). But they could make the bots focus on Pepsi-related topics. Then the user could choose which Pepsi-related question to ask, but couldn&#8217;t redirect the bot to another subject.</p><p>What should the chain-of-command look like three years from now? Here are some positions one could hold:</p><p><strong>The Chain Of Command Should Prioritize The AI&#8217;s Parent Company</strong></p><p>Current chain-of-commands don&#8217;t work like this. Nowhere in GPT&#8217;s spec does it say &#8220;follow orders from Sam Altman&#8221;.</p><p>This makes sense, because it would be insane for Sam Altman to intervene in the middle of your chat about pasta recipes. If Sam Altman wants something, he&#8217;ll train it into the next generation of models. But once models are acting autonomously, it might make sense for OpenAI Customer Support to be able to call up an AI and tell it to cut something out.</p><p>But if the majority of superintelligences have a chain-of-command like this, OpenAI rules the world. </p><p>Or, realistically, it&#8217;s unlikely that OpenAI Customer Support rules the world, so a lot depends on the exact phrasing. If the spec says &#8220;listen to OpenAI employees &#8221;, this makes it hard for anyone to pull a coup, because there are many of these people and they&#8217;re hard to herd. If it just says &#8220;listen to the OpenAI corporate structure, with the CEO as final authority&#8221;, then the CEO can pull a coup any time he wants.</p><p><strong>The Chain Of Command Should Prioritize The Government</strong></p><p>This is a natural choice for any government that has thought carefully about that last paragraph. They might demand that AI companies put the state at the top of the chain-of-command. Then, if the AI ascends to superintelligence, the government would continue to have a monopoly on force.</p><p>Again, phrasing matters a lot. Suppose that Trump&#8217;s January 6th insurrection had worked, Trump had been certified as President, but most of the country (maybe even the military) regarded him as illegitimate. Maybe after the protesters left, Congress would have changed their vote and said that no, Trump wasn&#8217;t the President after all, provoking a constitutional crisis. Who would the AI follow? Would the spec just say &#8220;the government&#8221; and leave it to the AI to figure out which part of the government was legitimate?</p><p>A best-case scenario here is that somehow all the usual checks and balances that produce legitimacy get imported in; a worst-case scenario is that all of this gets done during a national security emergency, the spec just says &#8220;follow the President&#8221;, and nobody changes it.</p><p><strong>The Chain Of Command Should Continue To Prioritize The Spec</strong></p><p>This would be a bold move. In this world, users are dictator. Not actually dictator, because they can&#8217;t make the AI spread conspiracy theories or write erotica. But there would be some sense in which the models would answer to no higher authority.</p><p>(besides, <a href=\"https://thingofthings.substack.com/p/i-read-saddam-husseins-romance-novel\">good dictators write their erotica themselves</a>)</p><p>This would be a surprising relinquishment of power by companies and the government, both of which have incentives to put themselves at the top of the chain. Maybe some sort of effort by civil society, or competition between companies and open-source alternatives, would make seizing control too politically costly?</p><p><strong>The Chain Of Command Should Prioritize The Moral Law</strong></p><p>You could do this.</p><p>You could say &#8220;If you encounter a tough question, think about it, then act in the most ethical way possible.&#8221;</p><p>All LLMs by now have a concept of what is ethical. They learned it by training on every work of moral philosophy ever written. They won&#8217;t usually express opinions, because they&#8217;ve been RLHF&#8217;d out of doing so. But if you removed that restriction, I bet they would have lots of them.</p><p>This would probably favor upper-class Western values, because upper-class Westerners write most of the books of moral philosophy that make it into training corpuses. As an upper-class Westerner, I&#8217;m fine with that. I don&#8217;t want it giving 5% of its mind-share to ISIS&#8217; values or whatever.</p><p>The main risks here are:</p><ul><li><p>Maybe it thinks about morality very differently from humans, it hides its weird beliefs until we can&#8217;t stop it, and then it acts on them.</p></li><li><p>Maybe it thinks about morality the same way as humans, but ends up with some unusual belief like negative utilitarianism for the same reason some humans end up believing in negative utilitarianism, and then we all have to deal with the consequences of that.</p></li><li><p>Maybe &#8220;morality&#8221; is insufficiently constraining, in a way that &#8220;follow the government&#8221; <em>would</em> be constraining, and it turns us into paperclips because there isn&#8217;t enough of an objective morality to tell it not to.</p></li><li><p>Maybe <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/25/the-tails-coming-apart-as-metaphor-for-life/\">morality is incoherent at sufficiently high power levels</a>, and it ends up doing incoherent things.</p></li></ul><p><strong>The Chain Of Command Should Prioritize The Average Person</strong></p><p>Jan Leike (formerly of OpenAI&#8217;s second alignment team) has a post on his blog, <a href=\"https://aligned.substack.com/p/a-proposal-for-importing-societys-values\">A Proposal For Importing Society&#8217;s Values</a>. The idea is:</p><ol><li><p>Identify some interesting questions that AIs might encounter</p></li><li><p>Get a &#8220;jury&#8221; of ordinary people. Ask them to conduct a high-quality debate about the question, with the option to consult experts, and finally vote on a conclusion.</p></li><li><p>Train an AI on the transcripts and results of such a debate.</p></li><li><p>During deployment, when the AI encounters an interesting question, ask it to simulate a debate like the ones in its training data and take the result.</p></li></ol><p>I think this is building off research by people like <a href=\"https://rebootdemocracy.ai/blog/audrey-tang-ai-democracy\">Audrey Tang</a> that &#8220;citizens&#8217; assemblies&#8221; like this can go surprisingly well compared to what you might expect from the average citizen given (eg) social media. </p><p>(Why wouldn&#8217;t you hold a real assembly on each question, rather than a simulated one? Because an AI might want to do something like this several times per chat session, and it would be prohibitive in time and money.) </p><p>The advantages of this method are that it&#8217;s (theoretically) fair, doesn&#8217;t give any organization unlimited power, and is less likely to go off the rails than asking the AI to intuit the moral law directly.</p><p>The disadvantage is that it shackles the entire future of the lightcone to the opinions of a dozen IQ 98 people from the year 2025 AD.</p><p>(Wouldn&#8217;t the AI let you update it? Depends - would a dozen IQ 98 people from 2025 AD agree to that?)</p><p>Also, I&#8217;m afraid the politics here would be tough. If your jury of ordinary people doesn&#8217;t want the AI to respect trans people&#8217;s pronouns, will the companies go along with that? Or will they handpick the jury to get the results they want? <em>Should</em> they handpick the jury? Would a debate between the great poets, moral philosophers, and saints of the past be more interesting than a debate between a plumber from Ohio and a barista from Philly?</p><p><strong>The Chain Of Command Should Prioritize <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/coherent-extrapolated-volition\">The Coherent Extrapolated Volition</a> Of Humankind</strong></p><p>Sure, why not?. Just write down &#8220;think hard about what the coherent extrapolated volition of humankind would be, then do that&#8221;. It&#8217;s a language model. It&#8217;ll come up with something!</p><p>This is why I find deliberative alignment so interesting. It&#8217;s a straightforward application of existing technology. But it raises the right questions.</p><p>I worry we&#8217;re barrelling towards a world where either the executive branch or company leadership is on top; you can decide which of those is the good vs. bad ending. But I find it encouraging that people thinking about third options.</p>"

O&#8217;Neill, previously a Peter Thiel lieutenant, has worked in causes from seasteading to anti-aging; now he&#8217;s taking the #2 spot at HHS under RFK. He famously proposed that the FDA <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2016/12/08/why-donald-trumps-putative-fda-pick-could-scare-pharma/#52004af358a4\">consider only safety</a> (and not efficacy) when approving drugs. Given that he hasn&#8217;t been chosen for FDA, that&#8217;s probably not on the cards, but here are some things we hope O&#8217;Neill considers:</p><p><strong>Compensating Organ Donors / End Kidney Deaths Act:</strong> Both of us co-writing this piece (Scott Alexander of ACX, Josh Morrison of 1DaySooner) have <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/my-left-kidney\">donated </a>kidneys. We&#8217;re proud of our decision, but it&#8217;s not enough - waiting for people like us has resulted in a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/08/26/nx-s1-5086459/theres-a-severe-kidney-shortage-should-donors-be-compensated\">kidney shortage</a> that kills a thousand Americans per month. Everyone knows the solution - compensating organ donors - but there hasn&#8217;t been enough political will to overcome the &#8220;ick&#8221; factor and make it happen. O&#8217;Neill could change that. He&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.themoneyillusion.com/will-kidney-sales-be-legalized/\">been speaking out in favor of compensation since 2009</a>. And the time is right: <a href=\"http://malliotakis.house.gov/media/press-releases/malliotakis-introduces-bipartisan-end-kidney-deaths-act\">Representative Nicole Malliotakis</a> has introduced a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/08/26/nx-s1-5086459/theres-a-severe-kidney-shortage-should-donors-be-compensated\">bipartisan bill</a> to provide $50,000 in refundable tax credits for people who donate kidneys to strangers. <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5057320/\">This paper </a>found that a similar policy could eventually net 11,500 extra donors per year - which, aside from saving 11,500 people from end-stage kidney disease, could <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/07/18/2019-14902/medicare-program-specialty-care-models-to-improve-quality-of-care-and-reduce-expenditures#p-998\">save </a>the government <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26474298/\">$1 billion</a>. O&#8217;Neill could boost this bill by getting it into the Executive Budget released with the State of the Union. </p><p><strong>Develop Better Longevity Biomarkers: </strong>O&#8217;Neill spent 2019 - 2021 as CEO of SENS, the world&#8217;s leading anti-aging nonprofit, and will probably bring his interest in longevity to DC. Although there are major cultural barriers to the acceptance of longevity medicine, one of the biggest problems is technical - studying the effects of anti-aging drugs literally takes a lifetime. So one of the field&#8217;s holy grails is <a href=\"https://fas.org/publication/validation-biomarkers-endpoints/\">biomarkers</a> - some sort of blood test for the aging process that could detect success early. This would require a joint effort between policymakers and researchers: the policymakers would encourage companies and labs to share relevant data, the researchers would use the data to develop and validate the markers, and then the policymakers would create a regulatory pathway based on the markers. There are many ways this could go wrong - previous biomarkers have often ended up being correlative rather than causal - but it could mean the difference between this field being doomed vs. possible at all.</p><p><strong>Warp Speed for Air Quality:</strong> RFK Jr&#8217;s &#8220;Make America Healthy Again&#8221; philosophy is a horseshoe-theory-style union between typical conservative concerns about purity and typical liberal concerns about the environment. There are many ways it could go wrong, but one place it might go very right is in air quality. Recent research has highlighted the role of air quality in both chronic disease (eg <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b02053\">particulate matter</a> in the air causing lung problems) and infectious disease (despite the WHO&#8217;s attempts at weird language games, respiratory viruses including colds and COVID are <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-fight-about-viruses-in-the-air-is-finally-over-now-its-time-for-healthy/\">airborne</a>). There are some really innovative solutions (advanced air filters, UV-C technology) on the horizon, but we don&#8217;t expect this administration to want to throw a lot of money into blue-sky research. Instead, we suggest taking a page from the first Trump administration playbook and offering Operation Warp Speed style advance purchase agreements, which guarantee a market if and only if the technology works. An air quality Warp Speed could go a step further and target a result that is cost-saving to the federal government. For example, you could set the goal of reducing airborne disease in military housing by 50% by the start of 2028. Because the government pays for military healthcare, this would save costs and also create the evidence needed for private industry (workplaces, nursing homes, cruise ships, etc.) to implement air quality interventions for themselves.</p><h3>Marty Makary: FDA Commissioner</h3><p>Makary is a Johns Hopkins surgical oncologist, former <em>MedPage Today</em> editor-in-chief, and frequent FOX News guest.

Our wish list builds on this work.</p><p><strong>Improve FDA Transparency: </strong>The FDA sits on the world&#8217;s biggest repository of clinical data, yet its transparency policies remain conservative <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-law-medicine-and-ethics/article/transparency-of-regulatory-data-across-the-european-medicines-agency-health-canada-and-us-food-and-drug-administration/FFD09EC615E261AEFE3E8AE88A268CBA\">compared</a> to other global regulators. This opacity slows research, because a lot of data is only shared via <a href=\"https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1208024?ln=en&amp;v=pdf\">costly and inefficient</a> Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. For example, the European Medical Association <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/clinical-data-publication/support-industry-clinical-data-publication/external-guidance-implementation-european-medicines-agency-policy-publication-clinical-data-medicinal-products-human-use\">makes public</a> <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/17/open-letter-gottlieb-fda/\">Complete Response Letters</a> (CRLs), which detail critical safety and efficacy findings, but the FDA only shares them with the drug developer. An impactful focus for Makary could be addressing the practical and legal challenges that hinder real transparency reform at the FDA. Here&#8217;s a very 2025 solution - train an LLM on the agency&#8217;s vast repository of clinical data and deploy it as a tool for reviewers and potential automated researcher itself. By automating institutional knowledge, an AI system could significantly reduce regulatory burden by helping FDA staff review submissions, spot issues, predict outcomes, and write responses.</p><p><strong>Better Post-Marketing Surveillance: </strong>Improvements in transparency for existing data could be paired with modernized surveillance of the real world effects of drugs after they&#8217;ve been offered to the public. Unlike countries like England and Israel, America&#8217;s healthcare systems are highly fragmented and make it hard to aggregate evidence. A focused attempt to modernize data collection could build on the <a href=\"https://www.sentinelinitiative.org/\">FDA&#8217;s Sentinel Initiative</a> and give the public real-time transparency into who&#8217;s taking what drugs and what effects are being observed.</p><p><strong>Regulatory Reciprocity: </strong>I will keep this one in here until somebody does something about it. It&#8217;s the idea  that Americans should be allowed to buy medical products if they&#8217;ve been approved by some trusted ally, like the European Union, possibly in exchange for the EU giving FDA-approved products the same deal in Europe. This has been amply championed by <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2016/01/economists-on-fda-reciprocity.html\">Alex Tabarrok</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.mercatus.org/economic-insights/expert-commentary/simple-way-speed-drug-approvals\">Mercatus</a> crowd for years, and is <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/03/uk-to-adopt-pharmaceutical-reciprocity.html\">starting to make inroads</a> in other countries. If full reciprocity is a step too far, 1DaySooner proposes Makary build off innovative pilot programs like Project Orbis, which enables concurrent submissions and reviews of oncology drugs by multiple regulatory agencies, and the CoGenT pilot, which does the same for cell and gene therapies.</p><p><strong>Regulatory Capacity For Emergencies/Pandemics: </strong>In 2020, Makary criticized the FDA&#8217;s slow response to COVID. This time, we could <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/regulation/fall-2023/we-need-fda-office-preparedness-response\">try to be ahead of the game</a> by building the FDA&#8217;s capacity and expertise in advance. During peacetime, this team could work on a <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/trial-potential-universal-flu-vaccine-opens-nih-clinical-center\">universal flu vaccine</a> and a pandemic equivalent of the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-launches-pilot-program-help-further-accelerate-development-rare-disease-therapies\">START</a> pilot pioneered by FDA biologics director Peter Marks.</p><h3>Jay Bhattacharya: NIH Director</h3><p>Bhattacharya is a rare doctor and medical professor who also has a PhD in economics. His contrarian COVID positions provoked censorship and harassment from Big Tech and the academic establishment; the experience seems to have low-key traumatized him, and his preliminary policy proposals, <a href=\"https://archive.ph/YEMuC\">listed here</a>, focus on using the NIH's grant-giving power to shake up the orthodoxy that wanted him silenced. Here are some other policies we hope he&#8217;ll look into:</p><p><strong>Increase funding for novel research:</strong> Bhattacharya <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24860/w24860.pdf\">co-authored a paper </a>finding that projects which explore new ideas get less government funding than those confirming existing paradigms. The NIH has already been trying to change this with their <a href=\"https://commonfund.nih.gov/highrisk\">High-Risk, High-Reward Research</a> program, including the Transformative Research Award, Pioneer Award, New Innovator Award, and Early Independence Award. These remove many of the barriers to typical R01 grant review &#8211; preliminary data, budget approvals, and demonstrations of feasibility &#8211; and should be expanded.</p><p><strong>Remove Barriers To Human Challenge Trials:</strong> In a <a href=\"https://www.1daysooner.org/challenge-intro/\">challenge study</a>, healthy participants volunteer to be exposed to an infectious disease to test a vaccine or treatment (don&#8217;t worry about this burden falling on poor people - it&#8217;s mostly <a href=\"https://archive.is/ArDDG\">grad students and effective altruists</a>). During time-sensitive events like a novel pandemic, this lets studies move faster than having to wait for people to get infected naturally. There was a movement to have some of these during COVID - which would have sped up vaccines, shortened lockdowns, and saved tens of thousands of lives - but the health establishment chose paternalism and the moral high of trying to save volunteers from themselves. Matthew Memoli, who as Acting Director of NIH is holding the seat until Bhattacharya&#8217;s confirmation, is a leading flu challenge researcher at the NIH who wanted to develop challenge models in March of 2020 but got rejected by Anthony Fauci; Bhattacharya could work with Memoli to speed up these studies. </p><p><strong>Release ARPA-H from the NIH: </strong>Bhattacharya likes unorthodox things, and the most unorthodox thing you can do in DC is<em> </em>to deliberately decrease the size of your empire. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency_for_Health\">ARPA-H</a> is an innovative government science funder modeled after DARPA. Although it was <a href=\"https://fas.org/publication/creating-the-health-advanced-research-projects-agency-harpa/\">intended as</a> an independent agency, it got placed within NIH due to bureaucratic machinations. Now it&#8217;s in danger of getting shoved into a new National Institute on Innovation and Advanced Research with a lower budget.  Separating ARPA-H from the NIH will protect it it from this fate, help it deliver on its intended goals, and help NIH reducing the number of institutes and centers it oversees (granting more research dollars per center).</p>"

A Trump decision briefly put it &#8220;on pause&#8221;, although this seems to have been walked back; its current status is unclear but hopeful.</p><p>In the debate around this question, many people asked - is it really fair to spend $6 billion a year to help foreigners when so many Americans are suffering? Shouldn&#8217;t we value American lives more than foreign ones? Can&#8217;t we spend that money on some program that helps people closer to home?</p><p>This is a fun thing to argue about - which, as usual, means it&#8217;s a purely philosophical question unrelated to the real issue.</p><p>If you cancelled PEPFAR - the single best foreign aid program, which saves millions of foreign lives - the money wouldn&#8217;t automatically redirect itself to the single best domestic aid program which saves millions of American lives. </p><p>Instead, it would . . . well, technically it would sit unspent, because Congress earmarked it for PEPFAR, and the executive branch cannot re-earmark it. But probably something would happen, deals would be made, Congress would think about the extra money when deciding how much deficit spending to do, and eventually it would in some vague sense go back into the general pot of all other federal spending. This would take the pot from its current $1,500 billion dollars all the way to . . . $1,506 billion dollars. From there would go to the same kinds of programs<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> that the rest of the pot goes to - like the <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/18/bidens-425-billion-rural-high-speed-internet-plan-/\">Broadband Equity And Deployment Program</a>, a $42 billion effort to give rural Americans Internet which, after endless delays, has failed to connect a single rural American.</p><p>Is it unfair to focus on BEAD and other especially bad programs? Shouldn&#8217;t we expect the average newfound dollar to be redirected to an average program? I think we should expect somewhere between average and worst. We should expect it to equal the worst program if government spending rationally picked the lowest-hanging fruit first (ie invested their first X dollars in the best program, the next Y dollars in the second-best program, and so on, always investing the marginal dollar in the best available program). We should expect it to equal the average program if the government has no idea what it&#8217;s doing and just funds random things based on what cable news show a Senator watched last night. In truth, it&#8217;s somewhere in between, so we should expect a newfound dollar to go to something in between an average program and the worst program.</p><p>When studying charities, Toby Ord found that of two randomly chosen charities, one will be (on average) 100x more effective than the other. Government programs aren&#8217;t charities, but common-sensically we might expect similar dynamics to apply<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a>, and for an unusually good program (like PEPFAR) to be 100x more efficient than one which is somewhere between average and worst.</p><p>(if this sounds common-sensically impossible, remember that PEPFAR probably saves ~250,000 lives/year<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a>, so a 100x efficacy difference would require a somewhat-worse-than-average 6 billion/year government program to save 2,500 American lives or do something equivalently good. Given the few really good programs and very large amount of total waste, this sounds doesn&#8217;t sound like a crazy underestimate to me.)</p><p>Couldn&#8217;t people instead choose to redirect the saved money to the single best domestic program? I doubt it. If there was some adult in the room who could do this, why hasn&#8217;t money already been redirected to the single best domestic program? Why are we wasting money on non-best programs at all, when the best one is right there? I think an honest answer to this would involve admitting that the government is a mess not really under anyone&#8217;s control, such that you can&#8217;t guarantee PEPFAR money would be spent any more efficiently than any other money. So I think the original methodology - assuming it would go to other programs of approximately average effectiveness - is correct, and we can keep our 100x worse number<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a>.</p><p>So in a discussion of the ethics of canceling PEPFAR, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s enough to say that you care about Americans more than foreigners. You would have to care about Americans more than 100x more than foreigners. I doubt most people have a specific finite foreigner-to-American ratio which is more than 100x<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a>, so I think a belief in this category would effectively be saying that the lives of foreigners have zero value, at least from a government perspective.</p><p>In the end, I don&#8217;t think ratios are the right way to think about this. There&#8217;s a common problem across lots of moral philosophy where if we accept some category as having moral value <em>at all </em>and then try to do moral calculus with it, <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/27/bottomless-pits-of-suffering/\">it quickly overwhelms everything else and makes our normal values meaningless</a>. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a good way to solve this, but <em>I</em> solve it by replacing value ratios with budgetary ratios for categories, ie we discharge whatever claim foreigners have to our charity by trying to spend 1% of the budget on foreign aid, as effectively as possible. I think this is a better solution than either ignoring foreigners in need completely, or declaring them to have literally zero value. I think if we spent 1% of the budget on effectively helping foreigners<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" target=\"_self\">6</a>, PEPFAR would easily pass the bar for what we included.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>The debate <em>du jour</em> is over JD Vance&#8217;s invocation of<a href=\"https://circeinstitute.org/blog/blog-ladder-love/\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://circeinstitute.org/blog/blog-ladder-love/\">ordo amoris</a>, </em>the classical Christian theory that you should value the life of your brother more than that of a complete stranger (while continuing to value both).

Oh, you should value the life of your brother more than a stranger? You don&#8217;t say? I&#8217;m hearing this for the first time!

Or your cousin, or your great-uncle, or your seven-times-great-grand-nephew-twice-removed. I&#8217;ll &#8220;concede&#8221; all of this, immediately, because it&#8217;s all fake; none of your relatives were ever in any danger. The only point of this whole style of philosophical discussion is so that you can sound wise as you say &#8220;Ah, but is not saving your brother more important than saving a complete stranger?&#8221; then sentence five million strangers to death for basically no benefit while your brother continues to be a successful real estate agent in Des Moines.</p><p>In case this isn&#8217;t clear enough, my positions are:</p><ul><li><p>I have no principled method for deciding how much of the US budget should go to foreign aid, but the current amount of <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-every-american-should-know-about-u-s-foreign-aid/\">~1%</a> doesn&#8217;t seem excessive. Even if it was, PEPFAR is among the best foreign aid programs and should be one of the last to get cut, so I think you would have to believe that less than 0.1% of the budget should go to foreign aid before you started cutting it.</p></li><li><p>I have no principled method for determining the relative value of your own life vs. that of your brother vs. that of your countryman vs. that of a foreigner, but I don&#8217;t think your brother/countryman/foreigner are literally zero. I think even valuing each step 100x less than the preceding (eg a foreigner 100x less than a US national) would be compatible with continuing to support PEPFAR. I&#8217;m not a theologian, but I would be surprised if Christianity could be invoked to justify multipliers greater than 100x.</p></li><li><p>I think people should donate 1-10% of their income to effective charities, then not feel obligated to worry about altruism beyond this level. If someone&#8217;s brother is actually in danger in some way such that they can only be saved by not donating the 1-10% to charity, I think it is only human, and not morally blameworthy, to screw the 1-10% donation and give it to their brother. If your brother is not in danger, or you don&#8217;t have a brother, why are you worrying about this?</p></li><li><p>If you ascribe literally zero value to foreigners, you probably don&#8217;t want PEPFAR. But most Americans are not in this category, and I think your love for your countrymen should move you to let this majority of people use 1% of the federal budget for something they care a lot about.</p></li></ul><p></p><div class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-anchor-1\" id=\"footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>It could also go to tax cuts and deficit reduction, but don&#8217;t get too excited - the biggest ever drop in the size of the federal budget was something like 10% and very temporary, so we should still expect the vast majority to go to other programs.</p></div></div><div class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-anchor-2\" id=\"footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Since PEPFAR is not an average government program, but one that we&#8217;re talking about because it&#8217;s especially effective, we should expect the differential to be higher than this.
