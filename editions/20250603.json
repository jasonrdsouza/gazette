As AI handles more routine tasks, developers might find themselves distanced from the underlying logic and architecture of their applications.<br /><br />The term &#8220;vibe coding,&#8221; popularized by AI expert Andrej Karpathy, describes a programming approach where developers rely on AI to generate code based on high-level prompts, often without fully understanding the resulting output. While this method accelerates development, it can lead to a superficial grasp of the codebase, making debugging and maintenance more challenging.<br /><br />A Reddit user reflected on this, stating:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;It feels like if I&#8217;m using Cursor too much, my skills are dulling out and my output is far less consistent. AI does produce code that is generally decent, but it cannot really be trusted given the few hard to spot mines sprinkled in.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This sentiment underscores the risk of over-reliance on AI tools, where developers might become passive participants, merely overseeing AI-generated code without engaging deeply with it.</p><p><strong>Prompt First, Ask Questions Later</strong></p><p>We&#8217;re entering a golden age where engineers no longer need to write code &#8212; just &#8220;strategically utilize&#8221; the AI tools that write it for them. The suits love this. &#8220;Less execution, more imagination,&#8221; they say, while silently calculating how many fewer engineers they might need if everyone just vibed a little harder with their copilots.</p><p>Meanwhile, devs are out here nodding along, generating functions they don&#8217;t understand, in codebases they&#8217;ve never seen, whispering prompts like they&#8217;re casting spells. The result? Nobody knows how the system works, but hey &#8212; at least we&#8217;re being <em>imaginative</em>.<br /><br /><strong>Balancing Automation with Intuition</strong></p><p>To maintain <em>Fingerspitzengef&#252;hl</em> in the age of AI-assisted coding, developers might consider:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Active Engagement</strong>: Instead of accepting AI-generated code at face value, take time to review and understand it. This practice reinforces comprehension and uncovers potential issues early.</p></li><li><p><strong>Selective Automation</strong>: Use AI tools for repetitive or boilerplate code, but handle complex or critical components manually to retain a deep understanding.</p></li><li><p><strong>Continuous Learning</strong>: Stay updated with the latest in software architecture and system design to complement AI capabilities with human insight.</p></li><li><p><strong>Still Write Code:</strong> Just because LLMs can plan and coordinate doesn&#8217;t mean they should write everything. Let them handle the boring bits &#8212; get your hands a little dirty. </p></li></ul><p>Because at the end of the day, when the logs are on fire and the system&#8217;s melting down, it won&#8217;t be your copilot getting paged at 3am &#8212; it&#8217;ll be you. Might be worth knowing what the code actually does.</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Architecture Notes &#8212; System Design &amp;  Software Development is a reader-supported publication.

                "<div class=\"trix-content\">\n  <div>The <a href=\"https://www.copenhageninternational.school/\">Copenhagen International School</a> is a wonderful private school located in the North Harbor of the city. It's home to over 900 students from around the world. This is where ambassadors, international executives, and other expats send their kids to get a great education in English while stationed in Denmark. As a result, it's perhaps the most diverse, inclusive school in all of Copenhagen. Lovely.</div><div><br />What's less lovely is the fact that CIS seems to have caught some of the same gender-ideology obsession that has ravaged many schools in America. We thought Copenhagen would offer a respite from the woke nonsense that's been plaguing California \u2014 where some schools in our social circle ended up with a quarter or more of the student body identifying as trans or gender nonconformative \u2014 but it seems ideological contagions travel as fast as airplanes these days.</div><div><br />It started last week, when the primary school, which includes kindergarten, declared its intention to spend every morning meeting for the entire week focused on gender dysphoria, transgenderism, they/them pronoun protocols, and coloring pride flags. That just sounded a bit odd and a bit much at first, but after reviewing the associated material, it actually looked downright devious. Just look at this example:<br /><br /></div><div>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--jpg\">\n      <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/97f66c06/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjE0MTYyODEyMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ--283a31829396d290675f23e7e6eff35f72b5bdb2e0f6cf6432180ffafc4c965f/trans-drawing-activity.jpg?disposition=attachment\" title=\"Download trans-drawing-activity.jpg\">\n        <img alt=\"trans-drawing-activity.jpg\" src=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/97f66c06/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjE0MTYyODEyMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ--283a31829396d290675f23e7e6eff35f72b5bdb2e0f6cf6432180ffafc4c965f/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6eyJmb3JtYXQiOiJqcGciLCJyZXNpemVfdG9fbGltaXQiOlszODQwLDI1NjBdLCJxdWFsaXR5Ijo2MCwibG9hZGVyIjp7InBhZ2UiOm51bGx9LCJjb2FsZXNjZSI6dHJ1ZX0sInB1ciI6InZhcmlhdGlvbiJ9fQ--b3779d742b3242a2a5284869a45b2a113e0c177f0450c29f0baca1ee780f6604/trans-drawing-activity.jpg\" />\n</a>\n  </figure><br /><br />Draw yourself in the mirror, then adorn it with trans colors? And the guiding example is a boy who sees himself as a girl?</div><div><br />As you can imagine, many parents at the school were mortified by the idea of their children participating in this kind of overt indoctrination activities, and some of them let the school know. That's when the revisions started rolling out.&nbsp;<br /><br /></div><div>First, the program was revised to no longer apply to kindergarten and first grade, just second through fifth. Then the \"draw yourself in the mirror and use trans colors to decorate it\" activity was pulled from the program. Then the schedule was reduced from all week to just a single session this Monday while the rest of the material is being \"reconsidered\". And that's where it stands today.<br /><br /></div><div>But that's not all. After talking to a number of other parents, I learned that CIS has other <a href=\"https://www.copenhageninternational.school/about/diversity-inclusion/\">highly objectionable programs</a> in this sphere. Like \"Gender and Sexuality Alliances\" where primary school students in G3-5, meaning kids as young as eight, are invited to join in lunch and recess meetings to talk more about gender, sexuality, and how to become a good ally to the 2SLGBTQIA+ community.<br /><br />  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png\">\n      <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/97f66c06/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjE0MTYzMDM5NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ--5d4674b6717824e307daae626253482021d1f86ad6d2b6c09da7708a71593919/gsa-at-cis.png?disposition=attachment\" title=\"Download gsa-at-cis.png\">\n        <img alt=\"gsa-at-cis.png\" src=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/97f66c06/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjE0MTYzMDM5NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ--5d4674b6717824e307daae626253482021d1f86ad6d2b6c09da7708a71593919/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6eyJmb3JtYXQiOiJwbmciLCJyZXNpemVfdG9fbGltaXQiOlszODQwLDI1NjBdLCJxdWFsaXR5Ijo2MCwibG9hZGVyIjp7InBhZ2UiOm51bGx9LCJjb2FsZXNjZSI6dHJ1ZX0sInB1ciI6InZhcmlhdGlvbiJ9fQ--7edc7b21f6fad97fa22412618822c4d19725431f296c7ce47dc174b61535d27c/gsa-at-cis.png\" />\n</a>\n  </figure></div><div><br />According to one parent I spoke to (who's considering pulling their kids out over this), CIS hasn't wanted to disclose all specifics about the staff conducting these lunch and recess meetings with the children. Because while it's billed as \"student led\" on their website, the sessions are actually facilitated by CIS staff on campus.&nbsp;<br />I've asked the same question of the school administration, including what qualifications these individuals might have, and have not received an answer either.&nbsp;But ultimately, it shouldn't even matter, because this shouldn't even be happening!<br /><br /></div><div>There's simply no responsible explanation for having kids as young as eight, or even as old as 11, in lunch and recess meetings with CIS staff to discuss gender and sexuality on school campus. It's preposterous, if not outright creepy.<br /><br /></div><div>The <a href=\"https://www.copenhageninternational.school/about/vision-and-mission/\">school's mission</a> is no cover either. The commitment to an inclusive school does not offer a license to indulge in this kind of overt indoctrination or inappropriate lunch meetings where minors discuss gender and sexuality with school staff. And it has to stop.<br /><br /></div><div>CIS, like any other school, should not be a subsidiary of any specific interest organization. We don't want our kids to get their information about climate change from either Extinction Rebellion or fossil-fuel lobbyists. We expect our school to stay politically neutral on the international conflicts, like the one in Gaza. In higher grades where these topics are appropriate, they should be discussed in a context that also includes things like the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/health-68770641\">Cass Review</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cvgq9ejql39t\">the recent UK Supreme Court ruling</a>.<br /><br /></div><div>It's the same reason Copenhagen Pride Week saw a <a href=\"https://cphpost.dk/2024-05-03/news/novo-nordisk-di-and-maersk-cut-ties-with-copenhagen-pride/\">massive loss of sponsorship</a> after trying to cajole major companies into a position on Gaza last year. Novo, Maersk, Google, and many others rejected this organization (and <a href=\"https://www.berlingske.dk/kultur/virksomheder-vender-igen-i-aar-ryggen-til-copenhagen-pride-et-tillidsbrud\">they're not returning this year either</a>) for their partisan politics. It's bizarre that those same companies now have the children of their employees programmed by this organization's agenda at school.&nbsp;<br /><br /></div><div>CIS needs to return to its high-level mission of focusing on giving kids an excellent education, teaching them objectively about the world, and upholding general standards for kindness and caring. Not coloring partisan flags during school programs, not facilitating inappropriate meeting forums about gender and sexuality between staff and children.</div>\n</div>"

Oops!<br /><br /></div><div>Microsoft's assurances met reality and reality won.</div><div><br />That reality is that all American administrations have the power to disconnect any individual, company, or foreign government from digital infrastructure provided by American Big Tech.

The continent is hopelessly dependent on American Big Tech for even the most basic of digital infrastructure. If this American administration, or the next, decides to use its sanctioning power again, Europe is in a real pickle. And with the actions taken against the ICC in Haag, Europe would be negligent to ignore the threat.<br /><br /></div><div>Denmark even more so. It's no secret that tensions between Denmark and the US are at a historic high. Trump keeps repeating <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-greenland-denmark-mette-frederiksen-nato-russia-china-2077596\">a desire to take over Greenland</a> by fuzzy means possible. The American intelligence services have been <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/greenland-spying-us-intelligence-809c4ef2\">directed to increase their spying</a> on Denmark and Greenland. Naturally, the Danes are spooked. They should be!<br /><br /></div><div>Regardless of what happens with Greenland, trade negotiations, or geopolitical disagreements, though, it would suit Europe well to become digitally sovereign. That doesn't mean cutting off all American tech, but it does mean rejecting any services that can be turned off from Washington. So in terms of Microsoft, it means no more Microsoft 365, no more Teams, no more Azure.</div><div><br />And that's exactly what the two biggest counties in Denmark have announced plans to do. Copenhagen and Aarhus just declared that <a href=\"https://politiken.dk/viden/tech/art10411353/Nu-er-det-nok-K%C3%B8benhavn-og-Aarhus-vil-g%C3%B8re-sig-uafh%C3%A6ngige-af-Microsoft?shareToken=tKwKubAE1XVA\">they're going to get rid of Microsoft products</a> for all their workers. The Copenhagen county is the largest employer in Denmark with over 40,000 employees. So this is a big deal!<br /><br /></div><div>The chairman of the Copenhagen committee who pushed this forward made this comment to Danish media:&nbsp;<br /><br /></div><blockquote><em>If, theoretically, the relationship to the US gets worse, we could fear that Microsoft would be forced to shut everything down. That possibility exists. And if we suddenly can't access our emails or communicate via our systems, we'll be challenged.</em></blockquote><div><br />That's an understatement. Denmark is one of the most highly digitalized countries in the world. It's also one of the most Microsoft dependent. In fact, Microsoft is by far and away the single biggest dependency, so it makes perfect sense to start the quest for digital sovereignty there.<br /><br /></div><div>But Denmark is also full of unambitious, defeatist bureaucrats who can't imagine a world without Microsoft. Just today, the IT director for The Capital Region <a href=\"https://www.version2.dk/artikel/it-direktoer-tror-ikke-paa-microsoft-exit-det-er-utopi-danmark-kan-udvikle-alternativer\">declared it to utopian to think Denmark could ever achieve digital sovereignty or meaningfully replace Microsoft</a>. Not even a decade would make a dent, says the director, while recognizing that if we'd done something 15 years ago, we wouldn't be in this pickle. A remarkable illustration of cognitive dissonance!</div><div><br />Sadly, this is not an uncommon conclusion from people who work inside the belly of bureaucracies for too long. Whatever has always done too often seems like the only thing that ever could be done. But, as Mandela said, it always seems impossible until it's done.<br /><br /></div><div>So let's get it done. Digital sovereignty isn't easy, but neither was securing a sovereign energy supply. Nor will it be to rebuild a credible defensive military. Europe needs all of it, yesterday. The bureaucrats who aren't interested in making it happen should find employment elsewhere.</div>\n</div>"

He was a Boston Terrier, and he just wasn&#8217;t that smart. His nickname was &#8220;Derpity Doo&#8221; because he was was that derpy. We all loved him a lot.  One day, we visited my parents, and we brought the Derp along. We got in the house, let him off the leash, and forgot about him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Important note about the Derp. He wanted to see the world. Unleashed outside of the house, he bolted in whatever direction suited him, and he kept heading that direction until he found a friend. A new best friend. Literally anyone in that direction. Derpity Doo had a GPS collar because of this repeated behavior. We mostly no longer panicked when he vanished, we just waited for the phone call from whoever that Marleau had derped his way into someone else&#8217;s heart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two hours into the parental visit, someone asked, &#8220;Where&#8217;s Marleau?&#8221; Nowhere to be seen. We checked the house, called for the Derp, walked the property, and eventually resigned ourselves to wait for the call, which did not come. We eventually left to home without Derpity Doo. The call came an hour later from an unexpected source: my mother.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Yeah, so I opened up the pantry closet next to the kitchen, and Marleau was just sitting there.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I repeat: Marleau had somehow gotten locked in a closet and then sat there for four hours. Fifteen feet away from where everyone was sitting. Didn&#8217;t make a sound even when we were hollering for him on the other side of the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The joke we told and retold, because Marleau just wasn&#8217;t that bright, was that he checked out his surroundings in the closet, saw there was no obvious exit, sat down, and decided, &#8220;Well, I guess I live here now.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was it. He was fine. Calm acceptance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My anxiety regarding the world has shifted from an unhealthy &#8220;it&#8217;s time to move elsewhere to an undisclosed location with an abundance of trees and a distinct lack of humans&#8221; to a semi-precarious &#8220;Ok, I can check the news for five to ten seconds, but I&#8217;m mostly devoid of hope. But I can smell hope\u2026 It&#8217;s wafting in from somewhere.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s behind the change? It&#8217;s not clear. It&#8217;s some version of &#8220;time heals all wounds,&#8221; or maybe it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;ve sorted the assundry horribleness into the correct buckets as opposed to just sitting there\u2026 unblinking\u2026 thinking &#8220;What. The. Fuck.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think it&#8217;s mostly the sad realization and acceptance that &#8220;I live here now.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, absolutely, we should not accept the current circumstances. Consistent, principled action is required from a great many motivated humans, but a good place to start is to recognize and accept your circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two Slack emojis are my go-to responses to complex situations. The first is the Dancing Penguin. He&#8217;s one of the reasons you see a penguin in much <a href=\"https://cottonbureau.com/people/rands\">Rands schwag</a>. The other is the Chonky Sad Panda.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sad-panda.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5161\" height=\"127\" src=\"https://randsinrepose.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sad-panda.png\" width=\"128\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He&#8217;s so chonky and he&#8217;s so sad. Defeated, but not destroyed. I&#8217;ve used this emoji for years to acknowledge, yes, we are in an unfortunate situation \u2014 we will act, but for now let&#8217;s recognize this is deeply sad. Let us accept that we live here now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I commissioned a <a href=\"https://cottonbureau.com/p/RTA3T8/shirt/chonky-sad-panda#/28729296/tee-men-premium-lightweight-heather-white-tri-blend-s\">t-shirt worthy version of Chonky Sad Panda</a>, which you can now purchase on Cotton Bureau. I am doubling all profits from the sales of this shirt (and <a href=\"https://cottonbureau.com/people/rands\">all Rands schwag</a>) and donating to <a href=\"https://www.pressforward.news\">Press Forward</a>, a non-profit focused on strengthening local news, because we need relevant and research-based truth more than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://cottonbureau.com/p/RTA3T8/shirt/chonky-sad-panda#/28729296/tee-men-premium-lightweight-heather-white-tri-blend-s\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5158\" height=\"1008\" src=\"https://randsinrepose.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/chonksadpanda-1024x1008.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not a Boston Terrier, it&#8217;s a Chonky Sad panda, but when I see the chonky sad defeat, I think of Marleau trapped in the closet. He&#8217;s not freaking out. He&#8217;s zen. Maybe he&#8217;ll start barking, but for now, he&#8217;s oddly complete, having chosen to accept his unfortunate, yet temporary circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A grounding first step. Calm. Situationally aware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Preparing. Perhaps a deep breath.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the bear wakes up.</p>"
