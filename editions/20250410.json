Paper, somehow, is underrated.</p>\n\n<p>But note, paper isn\u2019t that great as a store of information. You can\u2019t search, cross-references are iffy, and it\u2019s hard to copy or modify. Nobody I know really looks at their old paper notes very often. So don\u2019t optimize for storage. Optimize for thinking.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"observation-2-if-you-dont-have-a-system-you-wont-get-much-benefit-from-paper\">Observation 2: If you don\u2019t have a \u201csystem\u201d, you won\u2019t get much benefit from paper.</h2>\n\n<p>Say you want to do some thinking with paper right now. How would you do it? If you have no system in place, you\u2019ve got some problems: What paper should you write on? Where does it go when you\u2019re done? These are small problems, but they add friction. If you have to solve them, maybe you won\u2019t bother using paper.</p>\n\n<p>So solve them. Your \u201csystem\u201d could be, \u201cwrite on a notepad and throw the pages out at the end of the week.\u201d Fine! At least you\u2019re using paper now.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"observation-3-user-experience-matters\">Observation 3: User experience matters.</h2>\n\n<p>Some pens and paper spark more joy than others. Use them. This is not frivolous. When more joy is sparked when you scribble, better thinking follows.</p>\n\n<p>There are many other dimensions of user experience. Personally, I find paper with lines to be crushing and dehumanizing. But I recognize this is not a human universal.</p>\n\n<p>Or, say you decide to write in a notebook. Good. But have you noticed that most notebooks either (a) close if left alone on a table or (b) have spirals or wires that are wider than the notebook itself and get crushed if the notebook is left in a bag between two books, meaning the pages don\u2019t turn right, diminishing joy and therefore thinking?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"observation-4-categorization-is-hard\">Observation 4: Categorization is hard.</h2>\n\n<p>Probably somewhere in the world there\u2019s someone with three notebooks labeled \u201cwork\u201d, \u201chobby\u201d, and \u201cjournal\u201d and every time they want to write something it\u2019s obvious which notebook they should use. But I\u2019ve never met such a person and one imagines they spend their time sorting their underwear drawer or whatever rather than reading pseudonymous existential angst/science blogs.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve tried many times to have different notebooks dedicated to different subjects. But I <em>always</em> find things run together and endless edge cases come up requiring new notebooks and I end up carrying multiple notebooks around and the whole thing is such a hassle that paper sparks no joy at all.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"paper-systems-ive-used\">Paper systems I\u2019ve used</h2>\n\n<p>In college, my \u201csystem\u201d was to steal paper from printers (justified as \u201cprinting blank documents\u201d), scribble on it, and then leave unstapled stacks of paper everywhere to get lost or crumpled in bags. Looking back, this wasn\u2019t <em>that</em> bad.</p>\n\n<p>Later on, I tried notebooks. Many kinds of notebooks. All the notebooks. But none made me happy. Besides the categorization and crushed wires problems, I sometimes (often) write things and later decide they are wrong and cross them out and write, \u201cdynomight why are you so dumb and bad? why?\u201d It drove me crazy to have this \u201ctrash\u201d sitting around in the notebook. I tried having separate scratch paper and only copying the good stuff into the notebook, but this was too much work. I never found a solution.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I loooooove having lots of paper all visible at once. (As I write these words, seven sheets are splayed before me.) Loose-leaf paper makes this easy, but notebooks make it impossible.</p>\n\n<p>Then I decided to go all-in on notecards. The idea was that I could quickly try things, move the cards around, throw away stuff that was wrong, etc. And I could keep a stack of them in my jacket pocket, helpfully decreasing my social status.</p>\n\n<p>This <em>is</em> something wonderful about notecards. The fact that they\u2019re so small somehow reduces the mental threshold to start writing, which leads to more paper usage and more thinking. And unlike a notepad, they\u2019re durable and \u201cpermanent\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Still, they\u2019re <em>small</em>. It\u2019s annoying to write/draw anything substantial. Worse, I found my life was gradually filling with stacks of notecards. I tried buying photo albums and stuffing the cards into them, but this was a huge chore and those albums are expensive and gigantic and heavy. The piles kept accumulating. I couldn\u2019t beat them.</p>\n\n<p>My current system, the first one I actually like, is this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Buy three-hole punched printer paper.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Write on it.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Everything goes into a single-three ringed notebook in chronological order, no exceptions.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>When that notebook is full, take the paper out, put a sheet of brown cardstock on each end, and put brass fasteners through the holes.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>That \u201cbook\u201d then goes on a bookshelf, never to be looked at again.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>"

And by God I was rich.&rdquo; I wish I could describe the path to learning engineering strategy in similar terms, but by all accounts it&rsquo;s a much slower path. Two decades in, I am still learning more from each project I work on. This book has aimed to accelerate your learning path, but my experience is that there&rsquo;s still a great deal left to learn, despite what this book has hoped to accomplish.</p> <p>This final chapter is focused on the remaining advice I have to give on how you can continue to improve at strategy long after reading this book&rsquo;s final page. Inescapably, this chapter has become advice on writing your own strategy for improving at strategy. You are already familiar with my general suggestions on creating strategy, so this chapter provides focused advice on creating your own plan to get better at strategy.</p> <p>It covers:</p> <ul> <li>Exploring strategy creation to find strategies you can learn from",
