Also, Jake is poly, and I sometimes wonder if poly people are the only ones qualified to give dating advice: if you&#8217;re monogamous, you either met your future spouse quickly (in which case you have no experience), dated for years without meeting your spouse (in which case you can&#8217;t be very good), or aren&#8217;t looking for a committed relationship at all (which is just pickup artistry, and follows very different dynamics).

Some previous attempts at this have felt kind of forced, but <a href=\"https://christandcounterfactuals.substack.com/p/what-the-worlds-best-christian-philosopher\">the first post I read here</a> was actually pretty interesting. Richard Swinburne (apparently &#8220;the world&#8217;s best Christian philosopher&#8221;), thinks that:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;[One] reason why it is good that the human race should sometimes be in an initial situation of considerable ignorance about the causes and effects of our actions, is this. If God abolished the need for rational inquiry and gave us from childhood strong true beliefs about the causes of things, that would make it too easy for us to make moral decisions. As things are in the actual world, most moral decisions are decisions taken in uncertainty about the consequences of our actions. I do not know for certain that if I smoke, I will get cancer; or that if I do not give money to some charity, people will starve. So we have to make our moral decisions on the basis of how probable it is that our actions will have various outcomes&#8212;how probable it is that I will get cancer if I continue to smoke (when I would not otherwise get cancer), or that someone will starve if I do not give. Since probabilities are so hard to assess, it is all too easy to persuade yourself that it is worth taking the chance that no harm will result from the less demanding decision (the decision which you have a strong desire to make). And even if you face up to a correct assessment of the probabilities, true dedication to the good is shown by doing the act which, although it is probably the best action, may have no good consequences at all.&#8221; (<em>Could a Good God Permit so Much Suffering? A Debate</em>, pp. 52-53.)</p></blockquote><p>This is pretty galaxy-brained, but <em>something</em> galaxy-brained must be going on for God to tolerate the existence of evil at all, and this is a surprisingly natural extension of some common premises on the subject.</p><p><strong>13: </strong>Swedish study: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/1htp5qh/the_effects_of_diagnosing_a_young_adult_with_a/\">diagnosing the marginal patient with a psychiatric condition makes their life worse</a>. Of the two mechanisms they looked at, stigma seems more involved than drug side effects. My opinion: this study was done on conscripts undergoing a mandatory psych evaluation for the army, who had no previous reason to think they had a psych disease and had not sought treatment. This is a different situation from somebody who comes to a psychiatrist asking for relief from specific symptoms they have noticed. Also, Sweden c. 2005 is a different culture from America 2025 in terms of how much stigma a psych diagnosis carries. I think it&#8217;s possible that if you never considered that you had psychiatric problems, and were suddenly given a diagnosis in 2005 Sweden and told you couldn&#8217;t serve in the army, that&#8217;s likely to destabilize your self-image more than a person who knows they&#8217;re depressed going to a psychiatrist in 2025 US and getting antidepressants.</p><p><strong>14: </strong><a href=\"https://www.aibase.com/news/14454\">RIP</a> Felix Hill, research scientist at DeepMind and mentor to many in the AI community.

He says he took ketamine for mild anxiety and it plunged him into an incredibly deep depression that he couldn&#8217;t get out of; he leaves his story behind as a warning for others. I appreciate his warning, but I wish he had said more about what dose he used; different people&#8217;s ketamine doses vary by almost two orders of magnitude, I&#8217;d previously thought that the low doses were pretty safe and the high doses were sketchy, and I would like to know whether I should update or not.</p><p><strong>15: </strong><a href=\"https://oldjewishmen.substack.com/p/bhif-old-jewish-men-loses-a-friend\">RIP</a> Max Chiswick, professional poker player, effective altruist, and ACX reader.</p><p><strong>16: </strong>Adrian Dittman, a Twitter account widely accused of being Elon Musk&#8217;s alt, has been revealed to be . . . <a href=\"https://maia.crimew.gay/posts/adrian-dittmann/\">a guy named Adrian Dittman</a>.

Some theories:</p><ul><li><p>Musk turned right-wing, which ended his friendship with Sam for the same reason political differences have always ended friendships (but then what about the bet, which seems like objectively bad behavior?)</p></li><li><p>It&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/know-musks-ketamine-120000781.html\">the ketamine</a> (I still think people should be more open about what doses of ketamine they take so I can calibrate my opinions better!)</p></li><li><p>Gwern&#8217;s <a href=\"https://gwern.net/note/elon-musk\">longstanding theory that Musk is bipolar</a> (I keep objecting to this because he doesn&#8217;t show the right kind of mood shifts; a single shift from a steady state age 0-40, to a different but worse steady state in his fifties is, if anything, even weirder).</p></li><li><p>I wonder if he&#8217;s doing some kind of steroids.

Teenagers&#8217; labor isn&#8217;t worthless, even though adults are more skilled in every way and there are ~ten times more adults than teens. So even if there were tens of billions of AIs that were better than humans at everything, human labor would retain value. The counterargument is that if AGI labor cost less than human labor and you could always build another AI, then why would you ever use humans? I think the synthesis is that there will always be a finite number of AIs, and even if it&#8217;s some very high number like a trillion, you can always use humans to do a few extra jobs after all the AIs are busy. But would these human jobs pay a trivial salary, because they&#8217;re only the trillionth most useful job? Or would they pay a decent salary, because an economy of a trillion AIs is so impressive that even its scraps are lucrative? Also, most teenagers can find work, but most severely disabled people can&#8217;t - is there some limit to how outclassed you can be before the economy stops including you?

In the months leading up to his death many people reported that Lewis had become paranoid, claiming that he was being followed and that his life was in danger. In a desperate attempt for help, he sent a letter to his close friend, and then president Thomas Jefferson to request an audience. While traveling along the Natchez Trace, he stayed a night at an inn. During the night, the owner reported hearing multiple gunshots but never went out to check on the source. In the morning, Lewis was found dead in his cabin, sitting against the wall looking at the door, rifle in hand and shot in the back. In addition, while the room was ransacked, the only missing objects of note were Lewis&#8217; riding back and personal documents.</p><p>After an official investigation, his death was ruled a suicide and all further inquiry into the instance have been barred by the Us government. While Lewis himself did not have any immediate descendants, his extended family have submitted requests every year to have his body exhumed in order to confirm the cause of death. To this day their requests have unanimously been denied.</p></blockquote><p>Some speculation <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1hrrufe/whats_one_historical_fact_that_they_wont_teach/m52skzk/\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>37: </strong>In response to my post on H5N1 bird flu, <a href=\"https://x.com/Ayjchan/status/1874550348062544101\">Alina Chan asked</a> about the risk of a bird flu lab leak.

He says the short-run cause was the rise in social media and group chats, medium-run cause was the student protester generation of the 60s growing up and taking power within academia, and the long-run cause is that people will always have an urge to virtue-signal and the fall of traditional virtue-signaling categories (sexual purity, religious orthodoxy) left an unfilled niche. He recommends as a response our usual rules around religious pluralism - everyone can have a religion, but you shouldn&#8217;t bring it to work or demand orthodoxy from your employees. I think this is mostly right, but our tolerance around religion has always gotten awkward when religion has any real-world/political implications (eg the headscarf in France, Christian schools not wanting gay employees, teaching creationism, etc) and since wokeness is made entirely of real-world and political implications, our religious norms aren&#8217;t yet well-adapted to deal with it. Also, a lot of our religious pluralism norms are &#8220;just do the neutral, non-religious thing&#8221;, but wokeness thrives precisely by challenging what &#8220;neutral&#8221; is: if a studio releases ten films, and they all have white protagonists, is that &#8220;neutral&#8221;, or is it a surrender to the opposite &#8220;religion&#8221; of racism? If a woke employee demands that the studio have more films with black protagonists, were they the first one to defect, or just responding to a previous defection? If they claim it&#8217;s a business decision (&#8220;we&#8217;ll do better with minority demographics if we have some minority characters&#8221;), then it takes an active effort beyond just applying regular pluralism norms to &#8220;accuse&#8221; them of &#8220;wokeness&#8221; and mount some kind of response. </p><p><strong>43: </strong>In the past, I&#8217;ve used amisulpride as an example of American drug regulation failures - it&#8217;s a good antipsychotic drug which is widely used in Europe but which patent issues have prevented pharma from bringing it to the US.

Brian Potter of Construction Physics disagrees with Tom Wolfe&#8217;s thesis (reviewed by me <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/book-review-from-bauhaus-to-our-house\">here</a>) that modern architecture looks bare and boring primarily because artistic tastemakers promoted it as a style; Potter says that while something like this may have happened somewhat, the role of architects was secondary to the role of real estate developers, who were trying to cut costs. Modern skyscrapers cut costs both by directly being cheaper to build (eg save money on ornamentation) and because the walls are thinner (meaning more interior rentable space). Then the usual incentives of organizations to do what everyone else is doing and not rock the boat made stragglers go along. I appreciate Brian's extremely knowledgeable perspective. I also appreciate that he doesn't deny the modern architecture part of the story, since I think it's necessary - otherwise, you would expect very expensive \"prestige\" buildings like museums/opera houses/cathedrals to keep ornamentation, which isn't what happened. My remaining question for him is how much money is involved - would an ornamented skyscraper cost more like 2% more or more like 20% more?

Shouldn't we expect sub Saharan Africans to have lower IQ relative to g (since their education and literacy systems are often terrible)?</p><p>And then the part about them seeming much smarter than a first worlder with similar IQ makes sense - they'd do equally badly at tests, but in their case it's because e.g. they barely had a chance to learn to read rather than not being smart enough to think of the answer.</p><p>(Or a slightly more complicated version of this - e.g. maybe they can read fine, but never had an education that encouraged them to consider counterfactuals so those just don't come naturally).</p></blockquote><p>Yeah, this is the most important factor that I failed to cover in the post (I edited it in ten minutes later after commenters reminded me, but some of you got the email and didn&#8217;t see it).</p><p>For the second effect mentioned in the post - the one where Malawians are obviously smarter than intellectually disabled people - you could attribute it to any of:</p><ol><li><p>Lynn&#8217;s data and analysis were bad.</p></li><li><p>Lynn&#8217;s data and analysis were fine as far as they go, but the tests he based his work off of were trivially culturally biased - for example, they asked about English vocabulary in non-English speaking countries, or math problems to people who had never learned math.</p></li><li><p>The tests weren&#8217;t trivially biased, but the concept of IQ itself breaks down once you try to extend it to extremely under-educated populations, and it no longer predicts things as well as you would expect.</p></li><li><p>The concept of IQ is fine, but you are personally miscalibrated about what low IQ means because the only very-low-IQ people in your training set had developmental disorders.</p></li></ol><p>I think these probably explain 5%, 5%, 40%, and 50% of the effect respectively, and I should have been more careful to emphasize (3), which I think explains 40% of the effect.</p><p>The particular way I would flesh out 3 would be something like - if you&#8217;re illiterate and (somewhat) innumerate, you probably don&#8217;t have enough practice with symbols and complex mental operations to do even a &#8220;culture fair&#8221; IQ test like Raven&#8217;s Matrices. This doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that your IQ is <em>higher</em> than the Raven&#8217;s Matrices says - the person who underperforms on Ravens for this reason will also underperform on a wide variety of other abstract/intellectual/symbolic tasks, and this is part of what IQ means. But it means that Raven&#8217;s IQ won&#8217;t predict concrete tasks as well as you would expect.</p><p><strong>Fujimura <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/how-to-stop-worrying-and-learn-to/comment/86311584\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>The other major factor that I think should be reassuring about Lynn's estimates (and other cross-national IQ estimates) is that when you look at \"non-problematic\" sources that seem like proxies for IQ (e.g. World Bank data, educational performance), you see the same pattern as Lynn and others' IQ data.</p><p>It's easy for people to quibble about each and every IQ measure (and so people do), but that we see the same pattern of results using otherwise uncontroversial data sources should be reassuring.</p></blockquote><p>Yeah, many people tried to gotcha me with claims that Lynn did this or that or the other thing wrong. Lynn tries to defend his methodology <a href=\"https://sci-hub.st/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289609001275\">here</a>, but I think (and tried to argue in the post) that at this point, that debate is of historical interest only  - there&#8217;s too much confirmation now. One commenter brings up World Bank <a href=\"https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0064204/Global-Dataset-of-Country-Learning-Outcome\">Harmonized Learning Outcomes</a> as an example. Another points me to <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/bx86g\">this preprint</a>, which tries to update Lynn&#8217;s numbers using all modern standardized testing data and correlations with social development index and GDP. They find mostly similar numbers to Lynn: Malawi goes from 60 &#8594; 66, and new last place goes to Sao Tome &amp; Principe at 62. This is by people affiliated with Lynn and scientific racism, and you can choose not to trust their judgment either, but I think at least the SDI correlations are an extremely simple regression that it would be hard to fake. This kind of stuff is why I think simple failures of data collection and analysis are unlikely to explain more than 5% of the gap with our common sense. There&#8217;s definitely something weird about these numbers, but it&#8217;s got to be more complicated than just &#8220;racist people screwed up the test&#8221;.</p><p>But continuing on this subject - if IQ has two components, why would World Bank education data and GDP track the abstract/symbolic component of IQ, rather than the practical component of IQ? Or, rather, it&#8217;s obvious why this would happen in education. But why would GDP track abstract/symbolic rather than practical?</p><p>One possible answer is that the causal pathway is high GDP &#8594; lots of education &#8594; lots of practice with abstract reasoning &#8594; high abstract/symbolic IQ. I don&#8217;t think this can be the whole story, because some countries that &#8220;cheated&#8221; to get high GDP (eg oil sheikhdoms) can&#8217;t translate it into IQ points at the same rate as everyone else. I&#8217;m stuck with the boring basic explanation that maybe you need to do a lot of abstract reasoning tasks to get high GDP.</p><p><strong>Harzerkatze <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/how-to-stop-worrying-and-learn-to/comment/86312629\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>[Your claim that blacks everywhere should have the same genes] is far from true. While \"white\" may be a descriptor for a group of somewhat similar genetic backgrounds, having common ancestors not too far in the past, \"black\" is different, grouping populations of similar skin color, but common ancestors diverging way further back in time.</p></blockquote><p>Yeah, I didn&#8217;t want to get into all of this on the post, but I agree the way I phrased it was misleading.</p><p>Lynn and other national IQ estimates find very low IQs for all sub-Saharan African countries - I mentioned Malawi at 60 in the post, but Nigeria, on the other side of Africa, is 69. Whatever is going on there is a pan-African problem, such that I don&#8217;t think differences between African groups are very relevant.</p><p>US blacks are mostly descended from people in west Africa, eg Nigeria. Some people also brought up that US blacks have significant white admixture. This is true but it&#8217;s still not enough to be relevant to this discussion. If we assumed everything was genetic and US blacks with their ~20% white admixture had genetic IQ of 85, we would still expect African blacks to have IQ in the low 80s. However you parse it, there&#8217;s got to be some kind of health/education/environment effect going on there.</p><p>Africa is extremely genetically diverse, but I think most of the countries measured in the paper, including Malawi, are some variety of Niger-Congo speakers, who I don&#8217;t think are that much more diverse than white people or anyone else. The really interesting African ethnicities, like the Khoi-San, don&#8217;t show up as much at a national level.</p><p><strong>Andrew Clough <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/how-to-stop-worrying-and-learn-to/comment/86319632\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Speaking of charity and IQ, the lowest of low hanging fruit is putting iodine in salt.

My neighbors and friends were mostly non-literate. They did not seem less intelligent than the people I know in my current (US) neighborhood or the people I grew up with (in the US). Most of them would not have performed well on IQ tests, though. They'd never attended school and had no familiarity with puzzle-solving. This was 35 years ago and most people had not seen movies or even photographs. I remember sitting with one older woman and helping her interpret a black-and-white photograph: this is the arm, here's where it connects to the body, etc. It's hard for people from literate societies with tons of exposure to text &amp; graphical representations to see the extent of the gap.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Calvin <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/how-to-stop-worrying-and-learn-to/comment/86329434\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I have a decent amount of experience with the intellectually disabled, and saying \"cognitive issues are only responsible for a small part of the [communication] deficit\" is so wrong that it makes me question everything else in this essay. Trust me, even making allowances for poor hearing or difficulty forming words, the cognitive issues are responsible for 90% of the deficit. An IQ of 60 is really low and it's a significant handicap.</p></blockquote><p>I was concerned to hear this - I have a little experience with the intellectually disabled, but it didn&#8217;t involve knowing people&#8217;s exact IQ, so I&#8217;m not very well-calibrated here.</p><p>Looking for more information, I found <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/ustat/ustat0301-01.htm\">https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/ustat/ustat0301-01.htm</a>, which purports to describe the characteristics of very low IQ people, mostly in the context of criminal justice (where lawyers often try to use a client&#8217;s low IQ as a mitigating factor - ie maybe he didn&#8217;t truly understand that crime is wrong). The report says things like:</p><blockquote><p>Although all persons with mental retardation have significantly impaired mental development, their intellectual level can vary considerably. An estimated 89 percent of all people with retardation have I.Q.s in the 51-70 range. An I.Q. in the 60 to 70 range is approximately the scholastic equivalent to the third grade [&#8230;]</p><p>Although mental retardation of any degree has profound implications for a person's cognitive and social development, it is a condition which in many cases is not readily apparent. While some of the mentally retarded, such as those whose retardation is caused by Down's syndrome or fetal alcohol syndrome, have characteristically distinctive facial features, most cannot be identified by their physical appearance alone. Unless their cognitive impairment is unusually severe (e.g. an I.Q. below 40), persons with mental retardation may be thought of as \"slow\" but the full extent of their impairment is often not readily appreciated, particularly by people who have limited contact with or knowledge of them, including police, prosecutors, judges, and other participants in the criminal justice system. Many capital offenders with mental retardation did not have their condition diagnosed until trial or during post-conviction proceedings.</p></blockquote><p>And gave some examples (slightly out of order for this list):</p><blockquote><p>Oliver Cruz, who was executed in Texas on August 9, 2000, had an I.Q. that was measured variously at 64 and 76. Cruz nonetheless insisted to reporters that, although he was perhaps \"slow in reading, slow in learning,\" he was not mentally retarded.</p><p>Mitigation specialist Scharlette Holdman recalled a client who so successfully hid his retardation from his attorneys that he allowed them to sign him up for college-level calculus classes, which he could not comprehend. He had gone through much of his schooling allowing his younger sister to complete his homework for him. When he was given papers to read in connection to his case, he would carefully stare at them. If he was asked a substantive question, he usually responded, \"I don't recall.\" Only when experts in retardation evaluated him and investigators reviewed his school records and spoke to his family did lawyers discover he had mental retardation and had been considered \"slow\" since his early childhood.</p><p>Another capital defendant \"hid his mental retardation for most of his life by working at a very repetitive job as a switcher on the railroad. He lied about finishing high school. He was actually in special education classes and did not finish the sixth grade. He was drafted into the army and discharged because of his mental retardation. He lied about his service record. He often made things up so that people would not suspect mental retardation.\"</p><p>Morris Mason, whose I.Q. was 62-66, was executed in 1985 in Virginia after being convicted of rape and murder. Before his execution, Mason asked one of his legal advisors for advice on what to wear to his funeral</p><p>As one psychiatrist testified about a capital defendant with an I.Q. of between 35 to 45: \"[People with mental retardation try] to go along with people that they suspect are in authority. For example, I asked [the defendant] where we were when I saw him, and he obviously didn't know, so I asked him if we were in Atlanta and he said `Yes, we are in Atlanta.' In fact, we were in Birmingham, Alabama. I could have said New York and he would have said `Sure, New York'</p></blockquote><p>These people are obviously not going to win Nobels anytime soon. But even the guy with IQ 35 - 45 was still talking to people. I think this supports the thesis that intellectually disabled people without specific syndromes can seem pretty normal most of the time.</p><p>(though keep in mind that anything from the court system should be treated with a grain of salt - defense attorneys have an incentive to exaggerate the intellectual disability of their clients in the hopes that it gets them a lighter sentence)</p><p><strong>Lyman Stone <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/how-to-stop-worrying-and-learn-to/comment/86337731\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Emil's post isn't correct, however.</p><p>We know from the recent Reich lab paper on long-run genetic selection that there was strong selection for IQ in the neolithic revolution, which implies agriculture strongly selects for IQ and ability to plan.</p><p>Malawians are 60-80% subsistence farmers.</p><p>Even a \"normal\" low-IQ person cannot do the implied math and long-term planning involved in this kind of farming. And in fact, economists routinely find that African small-plot subsistence agriculture is actually highly optimized; farmers make very precise choices about where to plant which seeds, which fertilizer to use, etc. Key point is basically: it really isn't true that an IQ 60 person can run a farm functionally.</p><p>Moreover, mean IQ of 60 implies large shares even lower, at ranges that are uniformly nonverbal even without specific disability. And this is why in the actual record-level NIQ database, they truncate estimates below 60, because even the database managers realize these estimates are crazy.</p><p>See my post here: <a href=\"https://substack.com/home/post/p-154757665\">https://substack.com/home/post/p-154757665</a></p></blockquote><p>We know that people with extremely low IQs <em>in the Flynn sense</em> must be capable of subsistence agriculture, because pre-Flynn Effect, most of the West had extremely low IQs, and they were all doing subsistence agriculture.</p><p>How is this possible? Responding to Lyman&#8217;s comment, I wrote:</p><blockquote><p>I stick to the claim in this post - that our estimates for what a very low IQ means are poorly-grounded, and that people with low IQs can do some pretty impressive things, especially if they're concrete and part of a cultural transmission package. Maybe this is the Joseph Henrich \"Secret Of Our Success\" thing. We know that Malawians get poor test scores in school, so it seems like there's some disconnect between do-well-on-tests intelligence and run-a-subsistence-farm intelligence, and the abstract/concrete and novel/cultural distinctions are the best explanation that I can think of.</p><p>You say that \"the phenotype that arises from a given tested IQ in America is clearly vastly worse than the phenotype arising from the same tested IQ in Africa\", which I basically agree with. I think part of it is the syndromes issue raised above, and part of it is that maybe Malawians have zero contact with the culture of abstraction that IQ tests come out of whereas even very uneducated Westerners have some contact with it, and maybe another part of it is that whatever health/nutrition issues the Malawians have preferentially harm faculties responsible for more abstract tasks rather than more concrete ones.</p><p>For an opposite data point, when I was in Haiti, my boss told me (secondhand, no personal experience) of extreme difficulties working with Haitians, like that they couldn't alphabetize files even when that was explained to them. Many Haitains are also successfuly subsistence farmers, so I think this also supports some kind of heavy abstract/concrete distinction.</p><p>I don't think we're really disagreeing, just agreeing on something like the correlations that make up IQ being less valid outside the normal range.</p></blockquote><p>Maybe one way to look at it is to go back to the claim from the justice system document above, saying that people with IQ in the 60s are the mental equivalent of third-graders. The third-graders I know are very into Pokemon, and have all sorts of opinions on how if you add X bonus to a Y strength fire-type Pokemon and then play Z combo, it will [commence six weeks of droning on about different Pokemon cards]. Is this the sort of math/reasoning/strategizing that we don&#8217;t expect someone with IQ 60 to be able to do? Does the fact that third-graders can do it mean that we&#8217;re miscalibrated? I&#8217;m not sure.</p><p>The part of Lyman&#8217;s comment that gives me the most pause is his observation that, if the mean IQ is 60, a decent fraction of people must be 45, and a non-negligible portion 30. At this point, even third-grader comparisons don&#8217;t save us. I guess this is where I bring in the claim that IQ breaks down as a guide to practical living skills below some point.</p><p>You can see several more layers of response between me and Lyman <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/how-to-stop-worrying-and-learn-to/comment/86397491\">here</a>, but I was especially grateful for him teaching me two things I didn&#8217;t already know:</p><ul><li><p>First, he corrected my misconception about Reich on ancient European cognitive evolution. Reich had said that pre-agriculture Europeans were &#8220;2-3 standard deviations&#8221; below moderns. I had interpreted that as IQ deviations of 15 points, making them genetic IQ 55-70, which would have been pretty crazy. Stone tells me he actually meant PGS deviations, each of which was about 3-4 IQ points, so he&#8217;s claiming that pre-agriculture Europeans had genetic IQ of 90 (they probably also had lower IQ for environmental reasons).,</p></li><li><p>Second, he <a href=\"https://substack.com/home/post/p-154757665\">linked a post of his</a> where he found that, although IQ accurately predicts GDP at each time point, changes in IQ don&#8217;t predict changes in GDP, suggesting something weird is happening. I think the weird thing is the improvement in the abstract/symbolic/&#8221;test-taking&#8221; aspect of IQ separate from the practical aspect, mentioned above.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Final Comments/Conclusion:</strong></p><p>I should have been more careful to highlight the possibility that the subcomponents of IQ come apart at the tails and that this explains some of the effect. I didn&#8217;t do that partly because I thought it was closely related to the developmental syndromes point (which is a specific example of how things can come apart at the tails), partly because I expected people to misinterpret it as &#8220;IQ is meaningless and nothing is correlated with anything&#8221;, and partly because I don&#8217;t understand the correlations of different subcomponents with each other and g and practical skills to have a good opinion here. Still, I could have at least said &#8220;Maybe academic and practical skills come apart&#8221;.</p><p>Maybe I should have had a stronger opinion on whether Lynn&#8217;s exact studies were correct? Certainly lots of commenters had strong opinions that they weren&#8217;t. I had hoped that linking the Aporia article would be a sufficient pointer to my opinion that, while Lynn&#8217;s work was a first effort and far from perfect, the general thrust (including surprisingly low IQs in sub-Saharan African countries) has been confirmed by later research which is harder to bias. Maybe it would have been less controversial if I had just asked why sub-Saharan Africa has surprisingly low school test scores, but then nobody would have a good sense of what school test scores were normal vs. surprising and nobody would have cared.</p><p>I&#8217;m interested in learning more about Lyman Stone&#8217;s claim that changes in IQ don&#8217;t predict changes in development level. This could mean that development causes IQ (through education), but that sometimes you can get IQ through other means (like an extreme pro-education push by a poor country), and this doesn&#8217;t itself cause development. Or it could mean that countries have a real (genetic?) IQ and a fake (educational?) IQ, and the GDP only depends on the real IQ (but then how come Africa, which everyone agrees is underperforming its genetics, is in the expected place on the IQ/GDP correlation?) Or it could mean that the changes are fake, and changes in fake data don&#8217;t affect real GDP (but really? No country has ever really changed its IQ? Doesn&#8217;t that contradict our suspicion from the African data that something about education must be involved?)</p>"

Shouldn't we expect sub Saharan Africans to have lower IQ relative to g (since their education and literacy systems are often terrible)?</p><p>And then the part about them seeming much smarter than a first worlder with similar IQ makes sense - they'd do equally badly at tests, but in their case it's because e.g. they barely had a chance to learn to read rather than not being smart enough to think of the answer.</p><p>(Or a slightly more complicated version of this - e.g. maybe they can read fine, but never had an education that encouraged them to consider counterfactuals so those just don't come naturally).</p></blockquote><p>Yeah, this is the most important factor that I failed to cover in the post (I edited it in ten minutes later after commenters reminded me, but some of you",

It could be anything related to statistics, science, AI, self-improvement, blogging, academia, writing, rationalism, (effective) altruism, air quality, the welfare of animals, or anything I\u2019ve ever written about. Or it could be something else entirely. To encourage you to think broadly, I will try to pick at least one person with a topic not on the previous list.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who is eligible?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Anyone. In particular, anyone at any age or career stage. But also the other kinds of anyone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What will it cost?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there an application?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have no idea how many people will be interested, but when scarce resources are given away, demand often exceeds supply. So there is an application, which is <a href=\"https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/Hkd7fquTYwwWSW2p+GdKh8D0hFwcI8dkPgeStesk94E/\">here</a>: I basically just ask (1) what you want to do, and (2) how you hope I can help you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How many people will you pick?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Three. If lots of people apply, I <em>might</em> try to recruit some other mentors. Or I might be lazy and disorganized and not do that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How will you pick?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I will pick <em>primarily</em> based on how much I think I can help you and <em>secondarily</em> based on how much what you\u2019re trying to do will advance the general welfare of the universe. I stress that the primary axis is primary! If you make a strong argument that I can help you become very rich or succeed in dating (unlikely) then I\u2019ll pick you over some do-gooder that I can help slightly less.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What makes you great that you can mentor other people?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Nothing. Honestly, I could give you several reasons that I\u2019m less than ideal as a mentor! But I suspect that mentoring is valuable enough (and undersupplied enough) that even less-than-ideal people like me can still be helpful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How will we meet?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We will meet by video call using Signal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Will you share any details about me without my permission?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I might write about the results of this experiment <em>in general</em>, reflecting on how it went, giving tips for other people who might try something similar, etc. The whole point of doing this is to experiment and understand if it works, after all. If you <em>want</em> me to share some details about you, I might. But I am very sensitive to privacy and I will not share anything (even broad details) without running it past you first and I\u2019m extremely likely to agree to remove any information you ask me to remove, even if you\u2019re being ridiculous.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this a good opportunity to interview you or try to get you to go on a podcast, etc.?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No. I will attack you.</p>"

I almost considered not going because I was going to go to an event later that evening. But I was able to go and get a pretty solid 35-ish minute workout of kettlebell. I love using the kettlebell. The kettlebell is so useful because you can do basically every single muscle group with it. You can do explosive exercises with swings. You can do halos. You can do Turkish get-ups. You can work on your squat form and do rows all with the same device. Kettlebell is to me what climbing is to other software engineers. A multi-way to stay fit, a multi-tool of efficiency, something that just feels cool to swing around.<br /><br />As for diet, today snuck up on me. I had over a thousand calories left over by the time that I went to my evening event. But then I stopped by Chick-fil-A and had a Sprite and a spicy chicken sandwich and then went home and had a actually really good combo of raspberry sorbet and dark chocolate pretzel bark thins. I basically hit my cap which was pretty interesting how many calories can get consumed so quickly. <br /><br />I&apos;ve started to recognize the feeling of what 500-ish calories feels like, and that feels about roughly what I need for a meal for satiation for a few hours.<br /><br />I just finished Donella Meadows&apos; book &quot;Thinking In Systems&quot; and it makes me think about my weight as a system where the stock is the weight itself that operates on <b><strong style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">delays</strong></b> of flows of calories in and calories out. We don&apos;t have perfect information or foresight about how many calories we&apos;re going to consume any given day or how our body is going to process those calories, but we can move the numbers up and down to change the eventual stock. At least that&apos;s what I&apos;m hoping for.</div></div><img alt=\"I&apos;m Glad I Went to the Gym Yesterday\" src=\"https://www.bramadams.dev/content/images/2025/01/Image-6504423693.jpeg\" /><p></p>"

Nobody is coming! Why don't you just cross?! It seems silly, but the underlying philosophy is anything but. It's load bearing for a civil society like Denmark.<br /><br />Because doing the right thing every time can be put on autopilot, and when most people follow even the basic norms consistently, the second-order effects are profound. Like the fact that <a href=\"https://cities-today.com/copenhagen-named-as-worlds-safest-city/\">Copenhagen is one of the absolute safest major cities</a> in the world.<br /><br />But the Danes also know that norms fray if they're not enforced, so they vigorously pursue even small infractions.

And the metro is constantly being patrolled for fare evaders and antisocial behavior.<br /><br />It's broken windows theory on steroids. And it works.<br /><br />When we were living in the city for three years following the pandemic, the most startling difference to major US cities was the prevalence of unattended children everywhere, at all hours. Our oldest was just nine years-old when he started taking the metro alone, even at night.<br /><br />How many American parents would feel comfortable letting their nine-year old take the L in Chicago or the subway in Manhattan? I don't know any. And as a result, you just don't see any unattended children do this. But in Copenhagen it's completely common place.<br /><br />This is the prize of having little tolerance for antisocial behavior in the public space. When you take away the freedom from crackheads and bums to smoke up on the train or sleep in the park, you grant the freedom to nine-year olds to roam the city and for families to enjoy the park at dusk.<br /><br />This is the fundamental error of suicidal empathy. That tolerance of the deranged and dangerous few can be kept a separate discussion from the freedom and safety of the many. These are oppositional forces. The more antisocial behavior you excuse, the further families will retract into their protective shell. And suddenly there are no longer children around in the public city space or any appetite for public transit.<br /><br />Maybe you have to become a parent to really understand this. I admit that I didn't give this nearly the same attention before coming a father of three. But the benefit isn't exclusively about the freedom and safety enjoyed by your own family, it's also about the ambient atmosphere of living in a city where children are everywhere. It's a special form of life-affirming luxury, and it's probably the thing I've missed most about Copenhagen since we went back to the US.<br /><br />What's interesting is how much active effort it takes to maintain this state of affairs. The veneer of civil society is surprisingly thin. Norms fray quickly if left unguarded. And it's much harder to reestablish their purchase on society than to protect them from disappearing in the first place.<br /><br />But I also get that it's hard to connect the dots from afar, though. Many liberals in America keep Denmark as some mythical place where all their policy dreams have come true, without ever wrestling much with what it takes to maintain the social trust that allows those policies to enjoy public support.<br /><br />The progressive Nirvana of Denmark is built on a highly conservative set of norms and traditions. It's yin and yang. So if you're committed to those progressive outcomes in America, whether it's the paternity leave, the independent children, or the amazing public transit system, you ought to consider what conservative values it makes sense to accept as enablers rather than obstacles.</div>\n</div>"

That it's coming to the old world eventually.<br /><br />This is far more an article of faith than of analysis, mind you. I can also well imagine Europe sticking with Eurocrat thinking, spinning its wheels with grand but empty proclamations, issuing scorning but impotent admonishments of America, and doubling down on the regulatory black hole.<br /><br />Neither path is given. Europe was competitive with America on many economic terms as recently as 15 years ago. But Europe also lacks the ability to change course quite like the Americans. So the crystal ball is blurry.<br /><br />Personally, I choose faith. Optimism must win. Pessimism is literally for losers.</div>\n</div>"

                "<div class=\"trix-content\">\n  <div>For decades, the debate in Denmark around\u00a0 problems with mass immigration was stuck in a self-loathing blame game of &quot;failed integration&quot;. That somehow, if the Danes had just tried harder, been less prejudice, offered more opportunities, the many foreigners with radically different cultures would have been able to integrate successfully. If not in the first generation, then the second. For much of this time, I thought that was a reasonable thesis. But reality has proved it wrong.<br /><br />If literally every country in Europe has struggled in the same ways, and for decades on end, to produce the fabled &quot;successful integration&quot;, it's not a compelling explanation that it's just because the Danes, Swedes, Norweigans, Germans, French, Brits, or Belgians just didn't try hard enough. It's that the mission, on the grand and statistical scale, was impossible in many cases.<br /><br />As Thomas Sowell tells us, this is because there are no solutions to intractable, hard problems like cultural integration between wildly different ways of living. Only trade offs. Many of which are unfavorable to all parties.<br /><br />But by the same token, just because the overall project of integrating many of the most divergent cultures from mass immigrations has failed, there are many individual cases of great success. Much of the Danish press, for example, has for years propped up the hope of broad integration success by sharing hopeful, heartwarming stories of highly successful integration. And you love to see it.<br /><br />Heartwarming anecdotes don't settle trade offs, though. They don't prove a solution or offer a conclusion either.<br /><br />I think the conclusion at this point is clear. First, cultural integration, let alone assimilation, is incredibly difficult. The more divergent the cultures, the more difficult the integration. And for some combinations, it's outright impossible.<br /><br />Second, the compromise of multiculturalism has been an abject failure in Europe. Allowing parallel cultures to underpin parallel societies is poison for the national unity and trust.<br /><br />Which brings us to another bad social thesis from the last thirty-some years: That national unity, character, and belonging not only isn't important, but actively harmful. That national pride in history, traditions, and culture is primarily an engine of bigotry.<br /><br />What a tragic thesis with catastrophic consequences.<br /><br />But at this point, there's a lot of political capital invested into all these bad ideas. In sticking with the tired blame game. Thinking that what hasn't worked for fifty years will surely start working if we give it five more.\u00a0<br /><br />Now, I actually have a nostalgic appreciation for the beautiful ideals behind such hope for humanity, but I also think that at this point it is as delusional as it is dangerous.<br /><br />And I think it's directly responsible for the rise of so-called populist movements all over Europe. They're directly downstream from the original theses of success in cultural integration going through just-try-harder efforts as well as the multicultural compromise. A pair of ideas that had buy-in across much of the European board until reality simply became too intolerable for too many who had to live with the consequences.<br /><br />Such widespread realization doesn't automatically correct the course of a societal ship that's been sailing in the wrong direction for decades, of course. The playbook that took DEI and wokeness to blitzkrieg success in the States, by labeling any dissent to those ideologies racist or bigoted, have also worked to hold the line on the question of mass immigration in Europe until very recently.\u00a0<br /><br />But I think the line is breaking in Europe, just as it recently did in America. The old accusations have finally lost their power from years of excessive use, and suppressing the reality that many people can see with their own eyes is getting harder.<br /><br />I completely understand why that makes people anxious, though. History is full of examples of combative nationalism leading us to dark edges. And, especially in Germany, I can understand the historical hesitation when there's even a hint of something that sounds like what they heard in the 30s.<br /><br />But you can hold both considerations in your head at the same time without losing your wits. Mass immigration to Europe has been a failure, and the old thesis of naive hope has to get replaced by a new strategy that deals with reality. AND that not all proposed fixes by those who diagnosed the situation early are either sound or palatable.<br /><br />World history is full of people who've had the correct diagnosis but a terrible prescription. And I think it's fair to say that it's not even obvious what the right prescription is at this point!<br /><br />Vibrant, strong societies surely benefit from some degree of immigration. Especially from culturally-compatible regions based on national and economic benefit. But whatever the specific trade-offs taken from here, it seems clear that for much of Europe, they're going to look radically different than they've done in the past three decades or so.<br /><br />Best get started then.</div>\n</div>"

            "summary": "<div class=\"trix-content\"> <div>For decades, the debate in Denmark around problems with mass immigration was stuck in a self-loathing blame game of &quot;failed integration&quot;. That somehow, if the Danes had just tried harder, been less prejudice, offered more opportunities, the many foreigners with radically different cultures would have been able to integrate successfully. If not in the first generation, then the second. For much of this time, I thought that was a reasonable thesis. But reality has proved it wrong.<br /><br />If literally every country in Europe has struggled in the same ways, and for decades on end, to produce the fabled &quot;successful integration&quot;, it's not a compelling explanation that it's just because the Danes, Swedes, Norweigans, Germans, French, Brits, or Belgians just didn't try hard enough. It's that the mission, on the grand and statistical scale, was impossible in many cases.<br /><br />As Thomas Sowell tells us, this is because there are no solutions to intractable, hard problems like cultural integration between wildly different ways of living. Only trade offs. Many of which are unfavorable to all parties.<br /><br />But by the same token, just because the overall project of integrating many of the most divergent cultures from mass immigrations",

Most knowledge work is done behind some screen or another, and while it can be rewarding (especially since I enjoy what I do), all that time spent sitting and thinking, and thinking and sitting does get to me.

Knowledge work has its perks, and isn't as unhealthy as the news, podcasts, and YouTube videos would have us believe. The problem\u2014I've found\u2014is the screens after screens. Finishing up a long day of work only to plop down on the couch and turn on a slightly larger screen for entertainment is the real adversary. My brain needs rest, but not this kind.</p>\n<p>One solution is hobbies and crafts. I've always loved working with my hands. When I was younger it was building fortresses in the mountains with my brother, or putting together small models with superglue (inevitably sticking my fingers to the table in the process), or drawing and inventing new Pok\u00e9mon. These hobbies have morphed significantly as I've gotten older, but the premise stays the same: the best form of relaxation isn't consumption, it's creation.</p>\n<p>On writing this post I realise that I've collected a lot of hobbies over the years: Gyming, rock-climbing, riding motorcycles, cooking, writing, and hiking, to name a few. But more recently I've gotten into crafts such as leather-work and mechanics. These activities allow my brain some rest and my body to take over.</p>\n<p>This has grown so important in my life that in April last year Emma and I rented out a small workshop in an industrial building in Salt River, where we make all kinds of cool stuff. We invite our friends over for workshop evenings where we order food and work on interesting projects.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"workshop\" src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman/workshop.webp\" /></p>\n<p>From left to right we have Riko sewing up a storm (yes, he made that shirt himself); Andrew fixing his coffee grinder; Emma putting together some lego (although more recently she's been sewing and painting with watercolours); and Simon drawing. We've had friends bring in their speakers and mix decks and make music, not to mention some <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DDsSDa3q2PT/\" target=\"_blank\">workshop jams</a>.</p>\n<p>I've predominately been doing leather work (which is ironic for someone who doesn't eat meat). Over the November and December period I designed and created all kinds of bags, wallets, and belts. Needless to say I didn't have to do any Christmas shopping this year. People just got fancy bags, and wallets, and belts.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"bag\" src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman/bag.webp\" />\n<img alt=\"bag2\" src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman/bag2.webp\" />\n<img alt=\"sunglasses\" src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman/sunglasses.webp\" /></p>\n<p>I did a 5 day intensive wood-working course this past year as well. It was taught by a delightful old man with over 60 years of experience woodworking (and all of his fingers). However, I found that woodworking wasn't to my liking. Wood-chips want to get into your eyes, the wood dust into your lungs. The power tools will give you tinnitus if you give them half a chance, and take a finger or two in the process. There's also the cleanup.</p>\n<p>I'm sure woodworking is rewarding for some, but everyone needs to find their own yum.</p>\n<p>In order to learn mechanics I undertook stripping a worn out 125cc scooter down to the frame, refurbishing every component, and rebuilding it into a sporty little scoot which was gifted to a friend.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"scoot-0\" src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman/scoot-0-1.webp\" />\n<img alt=\"scoot\" src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman/scoot-1.webp\" /></p>\n<p>More recently I bought a non-running 1964 Honda Super Cub which I managed to get moving (although only temporarily, this is still a work in progress). I may be a bit too big for it, but it's so cute!</p>\n<video controls=\"controls\" width=\"100%\">\n  <source src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman/cub.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n<p>My brother is currently rebuilding an old American Muscle car (a 1969 Chevrolet Chevelle). I visited him in November to help with the <a href=\"https://datadiaries.bearblog.dev/chevelle-restoration-part-4/\" target=\"_blank\">installation of the engine</a>, which required some heavy lifting. He has a whole <a href=\"https://datadiaries.bearblog.dev/\" target=\"_blank\">blog on the restoration</a> if you're interested.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"engine\" src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman/engine.webp\" /></p>\n<p>All of these activities have been wholesome and satisfying. Certainly more so than binge watching all of Squid Games. After a few hours at the workshop I'm physically exhausted, in the best of ways. I've done something rewarding, spent time with the people I love, and (hopefully) have something cool to show for it.</p>\n<p>That isn't to say I don't spend some time consuming as a form of relaxation. I'm currently half-way though the final Stormlight Archives book (Wind and Truth). But I've never once regretted going to the beach or on a mountain walk after work. Never once spent time on a hobby and deemed that Netflix would have been better.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, I'm very lucky to have a workshop (it only costs me $150 per month in South Africa and is worth every cent). I'm also lucky to live in a city that has both mountains to climb and oceans to swim in. But I'm sure no-matter where I am, I'll still find something to keep myself busy.</p>\n<p>What will you do in 2025?</p>"
