Ruby, after thirty years of constant improvement, is now incredibly fast and efficient, yet remains a delight to work with.</div><div><br />That ethos couldn't shine brighter now. Disgruntled programmers have finally realized that an escape from nasty syntax, boilerplate galore, and ecosystem hyper-churn is possible. That's the appeal of AI: having it hide away all that unpleasantness. Only it's like cleaning your room by stuffing the mess under the bed \u2014 it doesn't make it go away!</div><div><br />But the instinct is correct: Programming <em>should</em> be a vibe! It should be fun! It should resemble English closely enough that line noise doesn't obscure the underlying ideas and decisions. It should allow a richness of expression that serves the human reader instead of favoring the strictness preferred by the computer. Ruby does.</div><div><br />And given that, I have no interest in giving up writing code. That's not the unpleasant part that I want AI to take off my hands. Just so I can \u2014 what? \u2014 become a project manager for a murder of AI crows? I've had the option to retreat up the manager ladder for most of my career, but I've steadily refused, because I really like writing Ruby! It's the most enjoyable part of the job!<br /><br /></div><div>That doesn't mean AI doesn't have a role to play when writing Ruby. I'm conversing and collaborating with LLMs all day long \u2014 looking up APIs, clarifying concepts, and asking stupid questions. AI is a superb pair programmer, but I'd retire before permanently handing it the keyboard to drive the code.<br /><br /></div><div>Maybe one day, wanting to write code will be a quaint concept. Like tending to horses for transportation in the modern world \u2014 done as a hobby but devoid of any economic value.<br /><br /></div><div>I don't think anyone knows just how far we can push the intelligence and creativity of these insatiable token munchers. And I wouldn't bet against their advance, but it's clear to me that a big part of their appeal to programmers is the wisdom that Ruby was founded on: Programming should favor and flatter the human.</div>\n</div>"
