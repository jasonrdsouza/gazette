We don\u2019t have to let that happen.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/JesseJenkins/status/1952866676724158833\">Albert Pinto</a>: Holy moly trump killed Moderna in US!!</p>\n<p>\u201cThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) today announced the beginning of a coordinated wind-down of its mRNA vaccine development activities&#8230;.&#8221;</p>\n<p>\u201cThe projects \u2014 22 of them \u2014 are being led by some of the nation\u2019s leading pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Moderna to prevent flu, COVID-19 and H5N1 infections.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jesse Jenkins: Project Warpspeed was probably the most consequential and unqualified success of Trump&#8217;s first term, and mRNA vaccines one of the most exciting medical advances of the 21st century. But this time, Trump 2.0&#8217;s anti-vax HHS Secretary (Kennedy) is cancelling all federal funding for 22 active mRNA development initiatives. There just aren&#8217;t enough facepalm gifs for all this stupidity.</p>\n<p>Alc Stapp: mRNA technology is miraculous and has so much potential.</p>\n<p>This is such a massive own goal.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ExistentialEnso/status/1953080107054121327\">Thorne</a>: We&#8217;re fairly close to being able to very effectively treat cancer with mRNA, and this will be a huge setback</p>\n<p>To be blunt: people you care about will die of cancer because of this decision</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s deeply delusional to think that just because this announcement is about respiratory viruses, it won&#8217;t greatly impact mRNA vaccine tech as a whole.</p>\n<p>mRNA companies get way less funding now and have strong signals that other mRNA vaccines might face regulatory hurdles.</p>\n<p>Also, a lot of people are responding as if I&#8217;m saying such a tech cannot possibly be developed without public funding. No, I said it was a huge setback. And that means people who could&#8217;ve been cured will die waiting for it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A huge portion of optimism about new medical technology, and even about the future in general discounting AI, is mRNA vaccine development. They\u2019re trying to kill it.</p>\n<p>Private investment can and must come in and over. The funding gap here is only $500 million. Certainly some combination of billionaires (and perhaps others) should step up and their make grants or invest as needed to fix it.</p>\n<p>The cost-benefit ratio here is absolutely absurd. When we think of the futures that aren\u2019t transformed by AI, mRNA is one of the technologies giving us the most hope. If those who heave the means do not pick up the slack here, flat out.</p>\n<p>This comes on the heels of various forms of <a href=\"https://x.com/KepecsLab/status/1894575968137667006\">amazing news</a> about mRNA, such as this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Kepecs Labs: Huge cancer breakthrough! mRNA vaccine (similar to COVID vaccine tech) shows stunning results against pancreatic cancer! <a href=\"https://t.co/NhpkJeaQYb\">75% of responsive patients STILL cancer-free at 3 yr, normally 80% recur</a>.

Won\u2019t they then have every reason to do it again and target the best programs? Won\u2019t this willingness to fund (acasually) be the reason this got cut?</p>\n<p>My answer here is no, because this cut was intended not to steal the money but to stop the research. The people who are cheering this have bought into their own paranoia or perverse incentives so much that they actually want mRNA dead. In such cases, it is relatively safe to step up, although it does carry some risk of giving people ideas.</p>\n<p>In other situations, the dynamics are different. Either the motivation was indeed to save or steal money, getting others to pick up the slack. Or it was to use a wrecking ball to kill a wide variety of things, knowing the best ones would then gets saved. Then you have to look at these questions a lot more carefully.</p>\n<p>The politics means both that the administration might then use other means to stop mRNA or at least not be helpful, or that this might mark one as an opponent of the administration.</p>\n<p>I would not worry much about the administration not playing further ball. This is a long term fight, and also we have reports Trump himself is not thrilled about the cuts. It is also quite a lot harder to turn down the life-saving medicine when the time comes than it is to deny the initial funding. The pressure would be immense, and also there are places besides America to start deployment if you need to do that for a bit.</p>\n<p>I also don\u2019t worry too much about this alienating the Trump administration. You\u2019re investing in America, Trump was reportedly not thrilled about the cuts, and he definitely isn\u2019t a true believer on this like he is on tariffs. He knows that being against mRNA is about placating crazy people, so if it happens without him, that is fine. That assumes, of course, that you are worried about this dynamic in the first place. Some people very much aren\u2019t.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Variously Effective Altruism</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/PAHoyeck/status/1947288689710637229\">This</a> pattern is common. I think centralizing suffering is a critical mistake, so you can substitute various things for \u2018utilitarianism\u2019 and also various things for \u2018suffering.\u2019</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rZGo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cb08fe1-b372-4a51-857f-4a7de3326830_727x788.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!F-Eb!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c165c06-aff0-4636-927c-6e48f220aed4_690x362.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Although also, yes, at reasonable prices, and while factoring in other things we also care about, we should reduce suffering.</p>\n<p>Also, yes, <a href=\"https://x.com/LemmySmackett/status/1947459499326894157\">this is about how well most people deal with hypotheticals</a>.</p>\n<p>This is also a central common pattern, and the difference that matters.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/dioscuri/status/1949188965480988998\">Henry Shevin</a>: Many years ago, I went to two animal welfare events with very different types of philosophers.</p>\n<p>The conclusion of the first was \u201cwe need to have another bigger conference next year, with animals present.\u201d</p>\n<p>The conclusion of the second was \u201cwe need to fund in-ovo chicken sexing.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>I would not go to either conference. But, if you did go to one such conference, you would want it to be that second one.</p>\n<p>I will note that there is already lots of talk about making the new in-ovo chicken sexing technology mandatory, starting in Europe. There will always, always be a push to make such things mandatory.</p>\n<p>Some more making fun of how awful Cate Metz is and how much he got everything wrong yet again:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/leilavclark/status/1953508106325103066\">Leila Clark</a>: on the lighthaven drama, from a friend:</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mcFw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6d7f6d8-75ed-409d-8437-c278b8b1690b_988x260.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/tszzl/status/1954802794122326033\">A true statement</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Roon: Public goods are often expensive gifts to yourself scaled up.</p>\n<p>David Manheim: Yes &#8211; and this is a reason that wealth inequality often leads to public benefit.</p>\n<p>The cheapest way for wealthy firms to have educated workers is public education, and the cheapest way for the rich to reduce climate risk is fixing emissions globally, etc.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is also why I refer to the \u2018chasm of personal utility.\u2019</p>\n<p>Once you hit f*** you money, there is remarkably little that additional money buys on a personal level. Marginal returns drop dramatically. It takes quite a lot of additional money to get remarkably little benefit. The things people buy for themselves that actually get expensive, like boats and lavish private parties, really aren\u2019t that great.</p>\n<p>If you actually want your life to get better, the only way to do so becomes improving the world, since you and those you care about have to live in it. Hence, public goods.</p>\n<p>As a toy example, as a gamer, I could basically buy whatever I want and not bat an eye, unless I wanted things like Vintage Magic decks, and even that has an upper bound. So at that point, if I want better gaming, what do I have to do?

Ideally actual fact finding, but that is expensive. You cannot play that card so often, and indeed you need a whisper network or something similar to know when to invest in fact finding. Next up would be creating common knowledge and only saying things in the open, which also has obvious limitations. If nothing else, it means that if you can make the victim or witness not want to come forward, in one of any number of ways, you get away with it, and it is not obvious how to go from \u2018whisper networks are bad\u2019 to preventing one from spontaneously arising unless you have an effective alternative mechanism. Also, if you cannot say anything negative about anyone without telling them directly, that leads to heavily biased information and also various games where silence starts to be highly meaningful. I don\u2019t see any good solutions?</p>\n<blockquote><p>Wes: Whisper networks are bad, for obvious reasons.</p>\n<p>Xenia: unfortunately also good for obvious reasons.</p>\n<p>Wes: Alas. The bad parts tend to eat the good parts.</p>\n<p>Sparr: In my intentional community organizing efforts, I have tried and failed a few times to establish this rule/norm:</p>\n<p>Say nothing negative about someone behind their back that you don&#8217;t say to their face, unless it should get them kicked out of the house.</p>\n<p>Wes: Why does it fail?</p>\n<p>Sparr: People refuse to honor/follow it. If I could find a core group of 3-5 people who would adopt this norm, new people could be acculturated.

He&#8217;d have to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid finishing high school.</li>\n<li>Avoid taking any standardized test.<a href=\"https://www.thediff.co/archive/what-happened-to-working-your-way-up-from-the-mailroom/#fn1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a></li>\n<li>Kept his early business hustle under wraps.<a href=\"https://www.thediff.co/archive/what-happened-to-working-your-way-up-from-the-mailroom/#fn2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a></li>\n<li>Avoided college.</li>\n<li>Not found a company where there&#8217;s a career track that starts at &#8220;unskilled worker earning subsistence wages&#8221; and somehow has a path to the top.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another way to say that is is that you only get Sidney Weinberg stories when the market for talent is fairly inefficient.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>But you can flip that around and give it a grim corollary: the measure of how efficiently talent is allocated in a society is how young you are when your dreams are crushed. A world where 99.9th percentile talent immediately gets snapped up by whichever employer can make the best use of that talent is one where 99.8th percentile people learn early on that they just don&#8217;t have what it takes.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>There is still a path for dropouts with few legible skills to work their way up to the top of a Fortune 500 company: start at the top, and stick around until your company is on the Fortune 500.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think this is mostly a case of romanticizing a path that was never great in the first place. It\u2019s not that it is impossible to \u2018work your way up\u2019 in this fashion, if you actually are good enough that you would deserve it, it\u2019s that if you could impress enough to actually pull it off working your way up then you have much better paths, with or without going through college. That\u2019s also largely about the great news that we have much better skill and reputation transfer, so you\u2019re not permanently at the mercy of the firm and your boss.</p>\n<p>I also very much don\u2019t think it means your dreams die quickly if you are \u2018only\u2019 99th percentile or 99.8th percentile talent. A hypothetically perfect sort where relative talent is static would do that, but neither half of that is true. Nor do you get locked out of most \u2018dreams\u2019 worth having if you get somewhat off track. There are certainly some that do have strict tracks, but they are that way because they are oversubscribed and mostly generic dreams and even then you mostly have redraws if you care enough.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">While I Cannot Condone This</h4>\n\n\n<p>John Wentworth offers <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/naAeSkQur8ueCAAfY/generalized-hangriness-a-standard-rationalist-stance-toward\">Generalized Hangriness: A Standard Rationalist Stance Towards Emotions</a>. Being angry because you are hungry means your anger is \u2018wrong\u2019 in its explicit claims, but it contains the useful information that you are hungry. Thus, the correct stance towards experiencing an emotion is to ask what information it actually provides you. A strong emotion is trying to tell you something is important, but you have to figure out what is the proper something.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Elizabeth: <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/\">For readers who need the opposite advice</a>: I don&#8217;t think the things people get hangry about are random, just disproportionate. If you&#8217;re someone who suppresses negative emotions or is too conflict averse or lives in freeze response, notice what kind of things you get upset about while hangry- there&#8217;s a good chance they bother you under normal circumstances too, and you&#8217;re just not aware of it.</p>\n<p>Similar to how standard advice is don&#8217;t grocery shop while hungry, but I wouldn&#8217;t buy enough otherwise.</p>\n<p>You should probably eat before doing anything about hangry thoughts though.</p>\n<p>Benquo: Unless you&#8217;ve observed that you tend to unendorsedly let things slide once you&#8217;re fed. In that case, better do something about the problem while you&#8217;re hangry.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I would generalize this even further than Ben Pace does here:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ben Pace: This rhymes with how one treats feature recommendations from users. It is typically the case that a user advising you to make a change does indeed have a problem when using your product that they&#8217;re trying to solve, and you should figure out what that problem is, but their account of how to solve it (what &#8216;improvement&#8217; to make) is usually worth throwing out the window.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Emotions also have practical effects beyond their information content, so you want to watch out for and optimize those as well. One aspect John does not get into is that you need not take your emotional responses as givens.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xPrL2xF9iYWpPmu6B/my-empathy-is-rarely-kind#7YscAPfjLYKdMP9qh\">John Wentworth also notes that his empathy is rarely kind</a>, that trying to imagine things from someone else\u2019s perspective can easily lead to the exact opposite of empathy if you would then view their decisions, in particular their lack of effort or willingness to apply effort to fix things, with disgust. Several comments point out that this could be seen as a failure to model their actual cognitive state, but why should we presume that should lead to empathy? The general case version of this resonates with me quite a lot.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/rSanti97/status/1952418353307427139\">Diverse workforces do not seem to lead to greater (or lesser) profits</a>, and the supposed McKinsey study people keep citing to claim the contrary, as far as we can tell, fake.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Santi Ruiz: The McKinsey study that claimed diverse workforces lead to bigger profits was always fake (they won&#8217;t share data, it doesn&#8217;t replicate for the S&amp;P 500 or other settings, and it doesn&#8217;t make sense). But fake social psych research is a demand problem, not just a supply problem.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I disagree that the finding doesn\u2019t make sense. Like many things in social psych, you can tell a plausible story of effects in either direction, or of no effect.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tropicsofmeta.com/2025/08/01/jury-in-a-box-justice-and-democracy-in-georgias-dekalb-county/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">A firsthand report of a jury trial (for molestation) in Georgia</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/CJHandmer/status/1952977599464165684\">True story</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Patrick McKenzie: I think many people would be surprised at the difficulties billionaires have in converting money into smart people and/or their outputs.</p>\n<p>C<a href=\"https://x.com/CJHandmer/status/1814819893092753427\">asey Handmer</a>: It is so hard that for essentially anything non trivial it still has to be done personally.</p>\n<p>The examples of this are too numerous to count.

By contrast, Google X, Virgin rockets, Blue Origin all had the best people and tech that money could buy &#8211; but it wasn&#8217;t nearly enough.</p>\n<p>I see this on an almost weekly basis now.

I notice my skepticism because if within-platform ads raise less revenue the platform should reclaim those costs via higher commissions, which should raise prices by the same amount. I note that o3 thought that there wasn\u2019t room for Amazon to do this, but that\u2019s weird.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://model-thinking.com/p/the-sun-never-leaves\">Did the UK\u2019s dominance fail because of emigration away from the home islands</a>? The argument here is that developed economies don\u2019t diverge that much on GDP per capita, but I don\u2019t think this means the UK keeps similar GDP per capita in the alternative world, especially if we\u2019re not on the margin and talking about 200 million people living there. The OP admits those people staying home would be a loss of welfare but I also assume it would have made the UK a lot poorer and also that population would have balanced largely in other ways.</p>\n<p>A much better and simpler story is that the UK home islands simply didn\u2019t have enough land and natural resources, which is why there was so much emigration in the first place? Europe was never going to be able to sustain its economic advantages indefinitely.</p>\n<p>And of course in recent times, the UK has been dying mostly of self-inflicted wounds, such as effectively banning the construction of housing, and now the saying of words.</p>\n<p>An excellent point:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/ByrneHobart/status/1954733058998898745\">Byrne Hobart</a>: An interesting corollary to this is that the more words it takes for someone to explain a concept to you, the greater the proportion of jobs you&#8217;ll dismiss as &#8220;bullshit jobs.&#8221; I&#8217;ve observed this, too!</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C2WA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a40a464-d293-4d62-8b75-e5ad237b57f8_573x696.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that the jobs here could be described in three words just fine, all you have to do is lose a little detail, on the level that \u2018I catch fish\u2019 simplifies fisherman.

If that is applied to individual wagers, then no one has an edge big enough to overcome it, so gamblers would have to either give up the gambling or give up on paying their taxes.</p>\n<p>But if you buy a sports futures contract under CFTC rules, then you get normal tax treatment, and you\u2019re back in business.</p>\n<p>This could all end up being a blessing in disguise. The current licenced sportsbooks in America offer highly non-competitive pricing, focus on pushing you towards predatory behaviors and products, and aggressively limit winners. Once Polymarket gets sufficient liquidity, trading there is remarkably cheap, and you are naturally pulled towards behaviors that have little cost even if you are betting at random.</p>\n<p>However bad you think companies like FanDuel are, they\u2019re worse.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/ButlerBets/status/1953553510739689533\">Ryan Butler</a>: FanDuel reports 16.3% sportsbook gross gaming revenue margin in June, the highest mark in company history</p>\n<p>This is roughly triple Nevada sportsbooks&#8217; historic hold percentage from before FanDuel launched its book in 2018.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There is no way to make 16.3% profit on wagers in general without being deeply, deeply predatory, even if all of your customers are suckers.

If we were doing a better job catching cheaters presumably people would be doing it less?</p>\n<p>Optimization for thee but not for me, I insist:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/JoINrbs/status/1945812347815387575\">Jorbs</a>: looked something up about a game and someone posted that you should resolve an issue a certain way unless &#8220;you enjoy making suboptimal decisions&#8221; and that is such a funny thing for a human who spends their time answering rules questions on forums for board games to write.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Clair Obscura Expedition 33 continues to go well as I move into Act 3, despite some frustrating design mistakes.</p>\n<p>One that I\u2019m rather annoyed by is that at some point (not a meaningful spoiler) there is a character you pick that the game is telling you that you need to have in your party or they won\u2019t learn their skills, similar to for example a Blue Mage in Final Fantasy V. I find this really annoying because that\u2019s not who I enjoy having in the party on an aesthetic level, but it feels bad missing out, and even worse not knowing if any given battle is a place you would miss out. Grr. I\u2019ve mostly decided I don\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>Even if you ignore that issue, the way upgrades work, both with Color of Lumina and weapon upgrades, effectively locks you into a party. I chose Luna and Maelle because I find that fun and more central to the plot. I\u2019m happy with my choices but sad that the game punishes experiment like this.</p>\n<p>Another main complaint is that balance is often lacking. Decisions that should be interesting instead feel forced. There\u2019s also a big \u2018too awesome to use\u2019 problem with certain resources, especially Color of Lumina.</p>\n<p>My biggest complaint is that it is very easy to get turned around, or for it to be otherwise unclear how to move on to the next area. Several times I have been extremely frustrated and effectively stuck, including right now as I type this inside the monolith. I am fine with navigation as an interesting puzzle or decision, but this does not feel like that.</p>\n<p>There are a bunch of things in Act 3 that are deeply confusing or rediculous, but all of them seem highly optional. If you want to go completionist that\u2019s your call.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mail-attachment.googleusercontent.com/attachment/u/0/?ui=2&amp;ik=8393096aec&amp;attid=0.1&amp;permmsgid=msg-f:1839195321748926758&amp;th=198622669167b126&amp;view=att&amp;disp=inline&amp;realattid=f_mdru4agh0&amp;zw&amp;saddbat=ANGjdJ-jOjNsQJcTQkT4qavkGv0jxmcKFIcGsSbhedhc_HoA50JUb1zDMePa-vQuBddimJhupXu2AUFoKlbfzzrRJ8UIuJs27dmm1aNUFCDK8IXkdVIEQCs7MGzjLAax3F4DM8kdga7MdPayOG6ruk6kbCRbWKTJVhxOP_qaOObA6HX15RRGQtKhAUueh6hEWuz64ER2khr14e5OknxITeISuGJuA6eeVijtOfCunLIslKBK0G-w7JFa1BIt6LbgLx_60rK8M5s-g81Vl1yyLQfCOSsUCgTNdY0HewY7pcNBbpUUyDpE_pDATooBehH_SCsFFtgQbwoA-VL6XZ1DFNc4re7EDOCevaCMG02Ma7bgg_aFO8M-CSOGgyxWsQC34wSqPE16lWpTj9jw87wiDvlFOkhrfnViaJhDvv6_GWgnFSRBKtf15PS3vv1LTKHHMFOfnPai0bTkDcR6ZEyo7QA6989LG0YGVOplLwO7nnsxTB2dhuxu_epbTX-r3e9BoYKixYvVSP80Nx_YsdrXrtO0cnh3Hfz2g_G24fifN37vFGh2ChQOE7H_wwYvVqkzUaSJJBhBYEbsP26gEaVDf8xlO9mdcfpfI4W6fazQtM5ARH_8o8UworZvbeTnwbW3djpXc01puxGzclUdfSWESWeWXoaqCWt4WzBAu1yTDPakmI-N4bqCcW5pXSmCW1z-Tg0P2okctLCEFPZQgIySMy5e4zDYFwmLYt65Jtyky5WBGGCIAIgTbNKQIx-qZP19iz58nTbtdypUcGYZCJR2WRNFKbfMMuavDkmCTNDizaZpYT0irz29qImShqFIz5Uf0BtXo_EdQxKMT8I0GKWbXhuOdN_6OKSkM9zQ-gR8GJ3_CCouAkaBRFbS_rMujwValQe-Wp0BdYD7f-HsbaL83kXK40SjODkVvdP8QlwDVAa10ajDO-gLYYjmVPGCnr-4uW1AqLkas7_1VmRxFpvpKCSWvCOTPXHETCsU475Z9AF4WQuXE1d7GQAMIcCpNSaFKhz22Aj8cyCu6nS1N0EB7wCKEK6IWvJpPJAAhYkWIg\">I think I largely buy this argument that one job RPGs</a> have big advantages over RPGs where you choose your class.

Final Fantasy made them $200 million in one day, and doing far better than any previous set, so much so that they could not meet demand. I didn\u2019t love the flavor details of many of the cards, clearly the market disagrees or cares little, and everyone says the limited format is great.</p>\n<p>Even Lord of the Rings took six months to get to that point, and that set is still selling several years later. Spiderman is up next. They see Japan as a \u2018potential gold mine\u2019 for more material.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this was always the endgame for Magic. We had decades of our own storylines and worlds, but once Magic went sufficiently big and mainstream and moved away from competition and two-player games towards Commander, being the meta-IP for all of fantasy (and perhaps beyond it) makes too much sense, and it will only feed on itself until and unless it wears the product out.</p>\n<p>This also seems like a solution for running out of design space. There\u2019s no shame in it after three decades. Magic has mostly fully mined the simple stuff that works, forcing complexity to drift higher and the mechanics that work are getting continuously recycled, even if they get new names. If you want to have higher complexity and repeat mechanics forever, top down is where it is at.</p>\n<p>Boen seems largely correct here:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/BOENSAW/status/1955097686618878161\">Boen</a>: we used to joke about this, but gambling mechanisms, metagame progression, interaction extenders, timewasting filler etc has all become so commonplace that most people genuinely just think that that&#8217;s what videogames are now &amp; get confused/angry when you say that stuff is bad.</p>\n<p>&#8220;metagame progression&#8221; is specifically like call of duty where a leveling system strings players along with little upgrades to keep playing. many stop after reaching max lvl, which betrays the fact that the &#8220;real game&#8221; is unfortunately shallow and boring absent external incentive</p>\n<p>Andre Treiber: I\u2019m with you on a lot of these, but I actually really enjoy meta progression as a mechanic. I really enjoy roguelite experiences and unlocking new things and making old challenges grow trivial is a rewarding part of the gameplay.</p>\n<p>Boen: Yeah there&#8217;s some subtlety here. I think that the type of thing people mean by &#8220;meta progression&#8221; in the context of roguelikes and stuff like that, is actually much more akin to regular game progression, not meta at all, which is of course a pillar of game design &amp; not a problem.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Roguelite metagame progression can be very good. I especially like it when you are unlocking additional abilities over time while you are not close to winning the run, and when the amount of progression you make determines what you unlock and is part of strategic decision making.</p>\n<p>What annoys me quite a bit are situations in which you are reliably winning runs, there are higher difficulties that would be interesting, and the game wastes a bunch of your time getting to them. The worst version of this is when you are winning your runs but also unlocking capabilities faster or almost as fast as the extra difficulty kicks in, so the game doesn\u2019t get harder for a long time and you\u2019re skilling up on top of that. The central example of this I remember is Roguebook.</p>\n<p>The other stuff is really terrible. The thing is, you could simply not do these things? Unless you are getting them on microtransactions there is no real advantage to keeping a player playing Call of Duty for 100 hours instead of 50 hours, not having any fun. Many games are using these techniques without the microtransactions. Stop it.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I Was Promised Flying Self-Driving Cars</h4>\n\n\n<p>As per Manifold, <a href=\"https://manifold.markets/JoshYou/how-many-paid-driverless-waymo-ride\">current expectations are for roughly 600k Waymo rides per week by EOY 2025</a>, and perhaps 1.5 million per week by EOY 2026.

The statements at the debate were even more absurd than I expected, which is on me.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Timothy Lee: Mejia considered it \u201cvery triggering\u201d for Waymo to use the term \u201cdriver\u201d to describe a technology rather than a person.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>City Councilor Benjamin Weber found it \u201cconcerning to hear that the company was making a detailed map of our city streets without having a community process beforehand.\u201d He added that \u201cit\u2019s important that we listen when we hear from the Teamsters and others who feel as though they\u2019re blindsided by this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s important that we pause\u2014sometimes we rush\u2014and make sure everyone\u2019s voice is heard before anything happens that we can\u2019t turn back from and that protections are in place for our workers,\u201d said City Councilor Erin Murphy.</p>\n<p>The next day, Murphy <a href=\"https://erinforboston.com/f/ordinance-opposing-deployment-of-autonomous-vehicle-operations?blogcategory=Public+Safety\">announced legislation</a> requiring that a \u201chuman safety operator is physically present\u201d in all autonomous vehicles\u2014effectively a ban on driverless vehicles. Given the near-unanimous hostility Waymo faced at the hearing, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Murphy\u2019s proposal became law in Boston.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There is good news elsewhere:</p>\n<blockquote><p>On the other hand, legislators in <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/washington-dc/2025/07/16/driverless-cars-dc-bill-waymo-robotaxis\">Washington DC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S344/amendment/A\">New York State</a> have introduced bills to open the door to driverless vehicles\u2014though it\u2019s not clear if these bills will become law. Legislators in New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia could also act on driverless vehicle technology in the next year or two.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Timothy Lee, who is an expert at following developments here, fears that blue states and cities might indeed ban self-driving cars, and we could get to a 2035 where red states had tons of autonomous vehicles and blue states and cities have none.</p>\n<p>It is not impossible, and certainly some amount of delay is in general likely, but I think we are going to win this one rather easily over time. It is impossible not to notice how much Waymo has improved San Francisco and other cities, and how much more it will improve it when supply goes up and thus costs and wait times go down. The lifestyle impact is dramatic and I do not expect the public in blue cities to accept being left behind.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/AlecStapp/status/1953638284170867166\">Alec Stapp</a>: We should be much more explicit about the tradeoff here:</p>\n<p>The Teamsters are demanding that we let thousands of people die in car crashes in order to protect their jobs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/cafreiman/status/1953570433699393761\">Chris Freiman</a>: When Teamsters try to block life-saving technology to protect their jobs.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TJru!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba3362a0-4e67-4895-ba62-38bd0d58ebc8_640x480.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Alec is not wrong about self-driving cars preventing deaths, yet I would prefer to not make that the main argument. Quite often the protectionist laws, including union rules and things that destroyed childhood in America, are imposed in the name of that same \u2018otherwise people will die\u2019 style of rhetoric. What we should focus on are the far more important and massive other transformative benefits.</p>\n<p>The jobs that they are trying to \u2018protect\u2019 are worse than useless. We would be requiring that people be paid to sit in cars and drive them all day, mostly not enjoying doing this or otherwise benefiting, doing the task worse than the AI could, in order to justify a transfer of wealth to those people.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rstreet.org/commentary/america-drives-act-addresses-need-for-a-national-autonomous-vehicle-policy-framework/\">Adam Thierer, together with Mark Dalton</a>, proposes Federal-level regulation on self-driving, allowing Level 4-5 automated driving systems (ADS) nationwide under a new safety framework under the extremely poorly named \u2018<a href=\"https://fong.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/fong.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/fong_010_xml.pdf\">America Drives</a>\u2019 act (since this involves America not driving, that is the entire point).</p>\n<p>The parallels and contrast to the insane AI moratorium are obvious, with concerns about \u2018patchworks of state and local laws\u2019 and localities doing crazy things like requiring a human driver be present as per Boston above.</p>\n<p>Here I am fully on board. We know what self-driving looks like and do not expect it to change in unexpected ways. We are creating a new federal standard and set of regulations that would work well. We have extremely strong evidence that expanding self-driving increases safety and saves lives. We also do not have to worry about existential or catastrophic risks, or that things could develop to a point where our mistakes could not be fixed once we notice them.</p>\n<p>Whereas all these considerations go the other way with respect to AI.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/Tesla_AI/status/1950779736365686890\">This below would be quite the exciting area to cover</a>.

This sounds like it would have been great last year too, which highlights how often there are big gains lying around that no one bothers to try and exploit until they are forced into it, even in places like the NFL.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/netflix-earnings-apple-and-f1/\">Apple is trying to get the rights to Formula 1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6489201/2025/07/11/f1-tv-rights-apple-espn/\">bidding substantially higher than ESPN</a>. Reportedly MLS regrets making a similar deal, as dealing with Apple causes fewer people to watch the games, which is a risk for F1 although I agree with Ben Thompson that no one was watching much of MLS anyway.</p>\n<p>I suspect it works the other way around. More and more households are giving up cable. If you are want to watch F1 and are told you need a cable package you would not otherwise get, that is super expensive. Apple TV is a lot cheaper and you can flip it on and off as needed.</p>\n<p>Where I have a bunch bigger concern is the interface. It is absurdly terrible. They don\u2019t give you an easy way to find what you want. When they do, they ruin it. I went to watch a Mets game on Apple TV and the icon for the game in question literally spoiled the final score, prominently, on purpose. Well, so much for that, and I think that played a substantial part in me giving up on watching the Mets this season.</p>\n<p>The better question is, shouldn\u2019t they be making a deal with Netflix? F1 has grown so much lately because of Drive to Survive. The synergies there seem fantastic. Netflix is optimizing for engagement and working on selling ads, and has a larger viewing base, so they should be happy to double down and match the $120m-$150m per year bid.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Antisocial Media</h4>\n\n\n<p>On the one hand, I stand by the claim that most of the moral panics about social media were directionally accurate. Social media wrecked quite a lot of things.</p>\n<p>I agree that some of the accusations in hindsight <a href=\"https://www.conspicuouscognition.com/p/the-case-against-social-media-is\">went too far</a>, and we should be skeptical of claims of the form \u2018social media broke America,\u2019 the same way you should be skeptical that television \u2018broke America,\u2019 or even that America is broken at all. I still think it is clear there are quite a lot of downsides at the personal and societal levels.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, we should not dismiss the upsides. It really is much easier to meet, keep up with, talk with and coordinate with your friends. Our access to information of all sorts is vastly better if you know how to filter it. I couldn\u2019t do what I do in this form without Twitter. They took a lot from us, but we got a lot in return.</p>\n<p>A lot of this comes down to whether what they took from us was good, actually.

But then that\u2019s\u2026 bad, right? Since Elon Musk is constantly saying Sam Altman and OpenAI are terrible? And this metaphor kind of makes Elon Musk into Darth Vader?</p>\n<p>I agree this could be a growing worry, but let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/SullyOmarr/status/1955307952623194160\">Sully Omar</a>: Good chance the internet becomes *extremely* closed in the next few years.</p>\n<p>We already see it with x/openai/anthropic (and most social media companies) where they actively discourage other companies from sharing/using links etc to other platforms.</p>\n<p>And it likely will get worse as the platform does not want external agents using their data</p>\n<p>Why? Because a competitor could create a better ai agent, and the user would never touch that platform again, and that\u2019s pretty bad for business</p>\n<p>so instead of making a better product, it will either charge for the data (making it $$), or just make their apis significantly worse/ shut off external access directly</p>\n<p>Either way sucks for consumers if we go down this path.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Then again, we are also seeing MCP connectors and AI by default will make integration and automation and getting around any and all of this easier. What OpenAI and Anthropic do to \u2018discourage\u2019 clicking on links is at most very light, and those links are links they are choosing to provide. I just did a GPT-5-Thinking query that provided links, and I clicked on the links, and it was fine.</p>\n<p>It is a dangerous game to shut AI agents out of your website. Right now, the AI agents are not good enough, so I would shrug and go to your website manually. But a year from now, I am probably going to be using an AI agents to book flights and make basic purchases and so on. What happens if Orbitz shuts me out and Kayak doesn\u2019t, or vice versa? The answer isn\u2019t \u2018oh then I will be forced to go to one manually.\u2019</p>\n<p>Even Amazon should worry about this. Currently my default is Amazon to buy things, but Amazon needs to outcompete all of AI search if they want to keep that position.</p>\n<p>There are two distinct sources of restriction here. We have restriction of access, especially via API, to shut out AIs. And then we have restriction of exit, discouragement of links. The first could be forced upon many because the alternative lets you be eaten. I am very confident the second one is mostly a mistake, but a lot of people seem determined to repeat it.</p>\n<p>To be fair to Musk and xAI, for all the problems I have with both how they handle Twitter and what they\u2019ve done with Grok, Grok does seem to take the whole \u2018speak truth\u2019 thing rather seriously when it isn\u2019t being directly fed a particular \u2018truth.\u2019</p>\n<blockquote><p>Aian McLaughlin (OpenAI): i think it&#8217;s under-discussed how grok really is a pretty good truth maximizer. kudos to the team. training smart models is hard</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MAru!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a9ec5b5-8230-4fc9-a305-07db72ecc766_870x900.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/Simeon_Cps/status/1955381156280668225\">Simeon</a>: Yes!

I get the instinct but my answer is no, the thing you are being offered is the ability to browse the books and see how they\u2019ve chosen to highlight them and lay things out, and perhaps sit and read. But I say this as someone who cannot remember the last time he\u2019s set foot in a physical bookstore.</p>\n<p>(Also at the link, there is appreciation for a bakery providing a free piano.)</p>\n<p>The errors made in the<a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/spilling-the-tea\"> Tea app</a> that let it get hacked multiple times<a href=\"https://medium.com/@jankammerath/tea-app-hack-disassembling-the-ridiculous-app-source-code-bc585e15bf4f\"> were even stupider than they appeared</a>.</p>\n<p>Right after writing about Tea I was informed they <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/a-second-tea-breach-reveals-users-dms-about-abortions-and-cheating/\">had a second far more damaging data breach</a>, again due to a very stupid bug, this time exposing DMs and other activity on the site, in ways trivial to trace back to real identities. Given that has happened, I would treat Tea the way you would information that someone could leak or subpoena, as in I wouldn\u2019t type anything into Tea you wouldn\u2019t want on the front page of The New York Times.</p>\n<p>Then someone went out and made TeaOnHer, as in Tea for men to spill about women. It got to number 2 in the lifestyle app section behind Tea. And then, of course, and let me tell you I feel bad for zero of the people involved in this:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/senatorshoshana/status/1953462931712000364\">Shoshana Weissmann</a>: FINALLY true gender equality for men and women!

Yep. Then it proved remarkably difficult to tell the app about the flaw. This particular gaping hole has since been fixed.</p>\n<p>There is a fun debate between \u2018no human would be so stupid as to, this must have been vibe coding\u2019 and \u2018no AI would be so stupid as to do this, it can\u2019t be vibe coding.\u2019</p>\n<p>For those in the first camp, I refer them to the Sixth Law of Human Stupidity, which states that if you say \u2018no one would be so stupid as to\u2019 then you know someone is indeed so stupid as to.</p>\n<p>I do not understand how <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/a-bug-allowed-kids-to-visit-x-rated-sites-apple-took-three-years-to-fix-it-17e5f65d\">Apple\u2019s Parental Controls could remain fully jailbroken by a constant text string for three years</a>, while the time limit settings doesn\u2019t work and the screen usage charts were inaccurate and so on.
