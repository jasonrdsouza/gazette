Although I've yet to see the kind of grotesque enforcement -- six armed officers at dawn coming to confiscate a laptop! -- but the trend is none the less worrying all across Europe, not just in Germany.</div><div><br />I suppose this is why European leaders are in such shock over Vance's wagging finger.

                "<div class=\"trix-content\">\n  <div>The new American vice president JD Vance just gave <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCOsgfINdKg\">a remarkable talk</a> at the Munich Security Conference on free speech and mass immigration. It did not go over well with many European politicians, some of which immediately proved Vance's point, and labeled the speech <a href=\"https://x.com/disclosetv/status/1890431994992996736\">\"not acceptable\"</a>. All because Vance dared poke at two of the holiest taboos in European politics.<br /><br /></div><div>Let's start with his points on free speech, because they're the foundation for understanding how Europe got into such a mess on mass immigration. See, Europeans by and large simply do not understand \"free speech\" as a concept the way Americans do. There is no first amendment-style guarantee in Europe, yet the European mind desperately wants to believe it has the same kind of free speech as the US, despite endless evidence to the contrary.</div><div><br />It's quite like how every dictator around the world pretends to believe in democracy. Sure, they may repress the opposition and rig their elections, but they still crave the imprimatur of the concept. So too \"free speech\" and the Europeans.</div><div><br />Vance illustrated his point with several examples from the UK. A country that pursues <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r7GRx8Sl-s\">thousands of yearly wrong-speech cases</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruPSgK6UuBU\">threatens foreigners with repercussions should they dare say too much online</a>, and has no qualms about handing down <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWB2W_ADasc\">draconian sentences for online utterances</a>. It's completely totalitarian and completely nuts.<br /><br /></div><div>Germany is not much better. It's illegal to insult elected officials, and if you say the wrong thing, or post the wrong meme, you may well <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27626fa8-3379-4b69-891d-379401675942\">find yourself the subject of a raid at dawn</a>. Just crazy stuff.</div><div><br />I'd love to say that Denmark is different, but sadly it is not. You can be put in <a href=\"https://danskelove.dk/straffeloven/266b\">prison for up to two years</a> for mocking or degrading someone on the basis on their race. It recently become <a href=\"https://politiken.dk/danmark/politik/art10258823/Hummelgaard-nikker-ja-til-at-Paludan-og-hans-partner-fors%C3%B8ges-straffet-for-brud-p%C3%A5-koranloven\">illegal to burn the Quran</a> (which sadly only serves to legitimize crazy Muslims <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdx2wqpg7zo\">killing</a> or <a href=\"https://x.com/ArchRose90/status/1890421519777505610\">stabbing</a> those who do). And you may face <a href=\"https://danskelove.dk/straffeloven/136\">up to three years in prison</a> for <a href=\"https://politiken.dk/danmark/art10276977/Det-var-ikke-selve-kommentaren-men-hashtagget-der-fik-den-42-%C3%A5rige-d%C3%B8mt\">posting online</a> in a way that can be construed as morally supporting terrorism.</div><div><br />But despite all of these examples and laws, I'm <a href=\"https://x.com/dhh/status/1890729990670499876\">constantly arguing with Europeans</a> who cling to the idea that they do have free speech like Americans. Many of them mistakenly think that \"hate speech\" is illegal in the US, for example. It is not.</div><div><br />America really takes the first amendment quite seriously. Even when it comes to hate speech. Famously, the Jewish lawyers of the (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/does-the-aclu-want-to-ban-my-book-11605475898\">now unrecognizable</a>) <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_Party_of_America_v._Village_of_Skokie\">ACLU defended the right of literal, actual Nazis to march for their hateful ideology</a> in the streets of Skokie, Illinois in 1979 and won.</div><div><br />Another common misconception is that \"misinformation\" is illegal over there too. It also is not. That's why the <a href=\"https://twitterfiles.substack.com/p/1-thread-the-twitter-files\">Twitter Files</a> proved to be so scandalous. Because it showed the US government under Biden laundering an illegal censorship regime -- in grave violation of the first amendment -- through private parties, like the social media networks.<br /><br /></div><div>In America, your speech is free to be wrong, free to be hateful, free to insult religions and celebrities alike. All because the founding fathers correctly saw that asserting the power to determine otherwise leads to a totalitarian darkness.<br /><br /></div><div>We've seen vivid illustrations of both in recent years. At the height of the trans mania, questioning whether <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_self-identification\">men who said they were women</a> should be allowed in women's sports or bathrooms or prisons was frequently labeled \"hate speech\".</div><div><br />During the pandemic, questioning whether the virus might have escaped from a lab instead of a wet market got labeled <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/4/21156607/how-did-the-coronavirus-get-started-china-wuhan-lab\">\"misinformation\"</a>. So too did any questions about the vaccine's inability to stop spread or infection. Or whether surgical masks or lock downs were effective interventions.<br /><br /></div><div>Now we know that having a public debate about all of these topics was of course completely legitimate. Covid escaping from a lab is currently <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/covid-cia-trump-china-pandemic-lab-leak-9ab7e84c626fed68ca13c8d2e453dde1\">the most likely explanation</a>, according to American intelligence services, and many European countries, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ban-on-puberty-blockers-to-be-made-indefinite-on-experts-advice\">including the UK</a>, have stopped allowing puberty blockers for children.</div><div><br />Which brings us to that last bugaboo: Mass immigration. Vance identified it as one of the key threats to Europe at the moment, and I have to agree. So should anyone who've been paying attention to the <a href=\"https://x.com/dhh/status/1884153318320009431\">statistics</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/visegrad24/status/1890164105744703908\">showing</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/RMistereggen/status/1889246613895328155\">the abject failure</a> of this thirty-year policy utopia of a multi-cultural Europe. The fast changing winds in European politics suggest that's exactly what's happening.</div><div><br />These are not separate issues. It's the lack of free speech, and a catastrophically narrow Overton window, which has led Europe into such a mess with mass immigration in the first place. In Denmark, the first popular political party that dared to question the wisdom of importing massive numbers of culturally-incompatible foreigners were frequently charged with claims of racism back in the 90s. The same \"that's racist!\" playbook is now being run on political parties across Europe who dare challenge the mass immigration taboo.</div><div><br />But making plain observations that some groups of immigrants really do <a href=\"https://x.com/dhh/status/1884153318320009431\">commit vastly more crime</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/jonatanpallesen/status/1879634729756135736\">contribute vastly less economically</a> to society is not racist. It wasn't racist when the Danish Folkparty did it in Denmark in the 1990s, and it isn't racist now when the mainstream center-left parties have followed suit.</div><div><br />I've drawn the contrast to Sweden many times, and I'll do it again here. Unlike Denmark, Sweden kept its Overton window shut on the consequences of mass immigration all the way up through the 90s, 00s, and 10s. As a prize, it now has <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/2007829/panic-sweden-31-bombings-rock\">bombs going off daily</a>, <a href=\"https://bra.se/english/statistics/shootings-and-violence?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">the European record in gun homicides</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/no-control-sweden-grapples-with-bomb-violence-wave/\">government that admits that the immigrant violence is out of control</a>.</div><div><br />The state of Sweden today is a direct consequence of suppressing any talk of the downsides to mass immigration for decades. And while that taboo has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/14/world/europe/sweden-elections-right.html\">recently been broken</a>, it may well be decades more before the problems are tackled at their root. It's tragic beyond belief.<br /><br />The rest of Europe should look to Sweden as a cautionary tale, and the Danish alternative as a precautionary one. It's never too late to fix tomorrow. You can't fix today, but you can always fix tomorrow.</div><div><br />So Vance was right to wag his finger at all this nonsense. The lack of free speech and the problems with mass immigration. He was right to assert that America and Europe has a shared civilization to advance and protect. Whether the current politicians of Europe wants to hear it or not, I'm convinced that average Europeans actually are listening.</div>\n</div>"

                "<p>Some of my favorite internet people sometimes organize little community experiments. Like, let\u2019s eat <a href=\"https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2022/04/29/potato-diet-community-trial-sign-up-now-lol/\">potatoes</a> and see if we lose weight. Or, let\u2019s take some supplements and see if <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/11/anxiety-sampler-kits/\">anxiety</a> goes down. I\u2019ve toyed with doing one myself, to see if <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine\">theanine</a> (a chemical in tea) really helps with stress.</p>\n\n<p>But sometimes, when everyone is having fun, some very mean very bad people show up and say, \u201cHEY! YOU CAN\u2019T DO THAT! THAT\u2019S HUMAN SUBJECTS RESEARCH! YOU NEED TO GET APPROVAL FROM AN INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>So I wondered\u2014is that right? Who <em>exactly</em> actually needs to get approval from an institutional review board (IRB)? More than a year later, I\u2019m now convinced that:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>No single source on the internet actually answers that question.</li>\n  <li>The answer is absurdly complex.</li>\n  <li>The reason it\u2019s so complex is that IRB rules are an illegible mishmash of things, some of which <em>themselves</em> have near-fractal complexity.</li>\n  <li>If you stare at this long enough, it\u2019s impossible not to question the degree to which we actually have \u201claws\u201d.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In this post, I\u2019ll give the answer and then explain\u2014in maddening detail\u2014why I think that answer is right. But first I want to tell a little story.</p>\n\n<p>I used to live in an apartment with an extremely steep driveway. When I had visitors, I\u2019d tell them, \u201cAt the bottom of the driveway you must slow to \u2152 of normal speed or your car will scrape the ground. I tell this to everyone and they only slow to \u00bd of normal speed and scrape their car on the ground. Don\u2019t do that!\u201d Then they\u2019d only slow to \u00bd of normal speed and scrape their car on the ground.</p>\n\n<p>Why? I think because my visitors simply couldn\u2019t believe my driveway was as stupid as it was. When I explained the rules of safe driveway usage, they mentally substituted the closest version of those rules that would be correct in a sane universe, one without driveways that form sudden 30\u00b0 angles with the road. I suspect this is a general cognitive bias.</p>\n\n<p>So, who exactly needs IRB approval?  Here are some myths:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Myth:</strong> IRB approval is only needed for medical research.</li>\n  <li><strong>Myth:</strong> IRB approval is only needed for federally funded research.</li>\n  <li><strong>Myth:</strong> IRB approval is only needed for research at \u201cinstitutions\u201d.</li>\n  <li><strong>Myth:</strong> IRB approval is only needed if you want to publish in a journal.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Wrong. But this is also a myth:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Myth:</strong> IRB approval is needed for all research involving human subjects.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Also wrong. As far as I can tell, after months of research, here is how it works:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/irb/irb.pdf\"><img alt=\"irb chart\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/irb/irb.svg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Now, I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cThat can\u2019t be right! The government can\u2019t possibly claim to regulate what me and my roommates eat at home! That would be stupid!\u201d Yes, it <em>would</em> be stupid. But who says the world makes sense?</p>\n\n<p>Now, would you actually be <em>prosecuted</em> for violating those rules? Unlikely. If a prosecutor went after you and you fought them in court, you might even be able to get some of these rules declared unconstitutional. But those are the rules as written.</p>\n\n<p><em>Caution</em>: I estimate a 85% chance that this post contains at least one minor error and a 40% chance of a significant error. I\u2019ve gone to insane lengths to try to get things right\u2014I regret ever becoming interested in this topic\u2014but this stuff is insanely convoluted. (Past experience says that someone reading this will know more than I do. If that\u2019s you, get in touch.)</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"reminder-of-how-law-works-in-the-us\">Reminder of how law works in the US</h2>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a sane person, and you want to know when IRB approval is needed, you might think something like, \u201cI know! I\u2019ll go find the IRB law and read it. Then I\u2019ll know what\u2019s legal and what isn\u2019t. Yay!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Hahaha, no. This won\u2019t work, for several reasons.</p>\n\n<p>For one, few federal rules actually come from <em>laws</em>. Usually politicians pass some broad law that says, \u201cHuman research is hereby regulated, details to come!\u201d And then government employees write <em>regulations</em> that contain all the details, and those regulations have the power of law. And then the government employees issue \u201cclarifications\u201d that supposedly don\u2019t change anything, but everyone treats like new laws.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the US constitution theoretically imposes severe limits on the power of the federal government. <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-8/\">Article 1 section 8</a> says the federal government has the power to (1) tax and spend, (2) regulate commerce, (3) control citizenship, (4) create post offices, (5) protect IP, (6) make treaties, and (7) do war. And the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\">10th amendment</a> says that\u2019s <em>it</em>: everything else is left to the states.</p>\n\n<p>The federal government doesn\u2019t like those limits, so it evades them in various ways. The classic trick is to declare that everything is related to commerce and therefore almost anything can be considered \u201cregulating commerce\u201d. For example, it\u2019s OK to make growing and eating wheat on your own property illegal, because <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn\">growing and eating wheat is \u201ccommerce\u201d</a>. Another trick is to write rules that sort of say, \u201cIf your state/organization wants back any of the money it\u2019s paying in taxes, then you must create and enforce the following rules: [\u2026]\u201d. For example, in 1984, the US government decreed that all states must raise the legal age to buy alcohol to 21 or they would <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Minimum_Drinking_Age_Act\">lose federal funding for highways</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the limits of federal power are only clarified when someone fights them in court. Did you know that at some point, bureaucrats decided that your boss must <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/2021/01/15/eeo/\">guess your race and report it to the government</a>? Is that an illegal overreach? Is it \u201cregulating commerce\u201d to make personal consumption of cannabis illegal in states that have legalized it? The way you find out is you break the rules, get prosecuted, and spend millions fighting in court. (For cannabis, the answer is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzales_v._Raich\">yes</a>, that <em>is</em> regulating commerce.) If you win, OK, no refunds on your legal fees. If you lose, you pay massive fines or go to prison. Also, courts have constantly changing judges and opinions.</p>\n\n<p>So what happens in practice is politicians write a vague law. Bureaucrats turn that law into very detailed (but often still vague) specific rules. Those rules might or might not be \u201clegal\u201d, but nobody want to risk fighting them in court. If the regulations are particularly ridiculous or likely to be overturned if challenged, prosecutors may quietly stop bringing cases. But the regulations still sit there on the books. And people still usually pay attention to them, because why risk it?</p>\n\n<p>OK! Where do IRB regulations come from?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-common-rule\">The Common Rule</h2>\n\n<p>In 1932, the United States government and Tuskegee University began studying 600 poor black sharecroppers in Macon Country Alabama, \u2154 of whom had latent syphilis. The idea was to observe the progression of the disease if left untreated. By the late 1940s, syphilis was easily treatable with penicillin, but the men were never informed of their condition, never treated, and were even given fake treatments and diagnoses.</p>\n\n<p>In 1965, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Buxtun\">Peter Buxton</a> joined the Public Health service and soon learned of the experiment. He was horrified and filed several official protests, but all were all rejected. Finally, in 1972, Buxton leaked the details to Jean Heller of the Associated Press which led to this <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/26/archives/syphilis-victims-in-us-study-went-untreated-for-40-years-syphilis.html\">front-page article</a> on July 26, 1972.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"NYT article\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/irb/NYT.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>This led to widespread outrage and cancellation of the study. By this time, dozens of the men had died from syphilis and many of their wives and children had also become infected.</p>\n\n<p>It also led, in early 1973, to a series of congressional hearings led by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kennedy\">Ted Kennedy</a> of Massachusetts. These hearings eventually produced the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Research_Act\">National Research Act</a>. Several people voted for <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/93-1973/s382\">the first version</a> of this bill and then against the <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/93-1974/s865\">second version</a>, including one Joseph Biden of Delaware, though I can\u2019t find any record of why. Anyway, it was signed into law by Richard Nixon on July 12, 1974.</p>\n\n<p>Formally speaking, what the National Research Act did was create a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Commission_for_the_Protection_of_Human_Subjects_of_Biomedical_and_Behavioral_Research\">commission</a>  to develop guidelines for ethical research in human subjects, including how IRBs should work. But in reality, it also sent a message that federal agencies should use their <em>existing</em> authority to regulate research. Even before the Act was passed, the Department of Health and Human Services had started <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1974-05-30/pdf/FR-1974-05-30.pdf#page=70\">amending</a> the federal code to regulate human research. In 1978, the commission issued a <a href=\"https://videocast.nih.gov/pdf/ohrp_institutional_review_boards.pdf\">report</a> on IRBs:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Commission believes that the rights of subjects should be protected by local review committees operating pursuant to federal regulations and located in institutions where research involving human subjects is conducted.</p>\n\n  <p>[\u2026]</p>\n\n  <p>The Commission further believes that institutions receiving federal support for the conduct of research involving human subjects should be governed by uniform federal regulations applicable to the review of all such research, whether it is supported by one federal department or another, or is not federally supported.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Informed by this report, lots of different agencies issued different regulations. This continued until 1991, when 15 federal agencies harmonized on what is known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Rule\">Common Rule</a>, because it is \u201ccommon\u201d to different federal agencies. This is now codified as <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/index.html\">Title 45 Part 46</a> of the federal code.</p>\n\n<p>Since 1991, this has been continuously updated and various other agencies have joined, notably the department of Labor. There are still a couple holdouts including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The CIA is an odd case\u2014they never issued any formal regulations, but supposedly apply the Common Rule because of a cryptic <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/executive-order/12333\">executive order</a> from 1981. The FDA hasn\u2019t joined because they have their own regulatory structure.</p>\n\n<p>So what does the Common Rule say? In principle, you can go <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-A/part-46\">here</a> and read it. Good luck with that. It\u2019s exactly as readable as \u201ca series of regulations amended by many agencies over many decades\u201d <em>sounds</em> like it would be. But basically: (1) It requires informed consent. (2) It requires that risks are reasonable in relation to expected benefits, <em>not</em> including any long-range benefits from new knowledge. (3) It requires participants are selected fairly and equitably (e.g. not all poor black sharecroppers) (4) It requires that federally funded research with human subjects is reviewed by an IRB.</p>\n\n<p>Now, that might sound simple, but what exactly is \u201cresearch\u201d? This is defined by <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/part-46#p-46.102(l)\">45 CFR 46.102(l)</a> to be a \u201csystematic investigation designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.\u201d It\u2019s best to understand this with an example. Say you\u2019re a teacher and you want to test if the cognitive bias of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_effect\">anchoring</a> applies to your class. Is this research? If you\u2019re doing it as part of normal \u201cteaching stuff\u201d, to demonstrate the effect to your students, then no. But if you\u2019re doing it in hope of <em>learning</em> if the anchoring bias is real, then that <em>is</em> research. To some degree, the truth lies in your heart.</p>\n\n<p>(The definition of a \u201chuman subject\u201d is also somewhat convoluted: What if you\u2019re using data someone else gathered? What if you\u2019re just using some human tissue samples or nonviable human embryos? But never mind.)</p>\n\n<p>Note that this applies to <em>all</em> research. The people who made these rules were almost all medical researchers thinking about serious medical risks. But they wrote the rules to apply to <em>all</em> research, including research where you might just ask people some questions.</p>\n\n<p>There are some narrow categories of research that are \u201cexempt\u201d from IRB review, e.g. research on <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2018-07-19/title-45/part-46#p-46.104(d)(1)\">standard educational methods</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2018-07-19/title-45/part-46#p-46.104(d)(6)\">food taste evaluations</a>, or certain <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2018-07-19/title-45/part-46#p-46.104(d)(3)\">benign behavioral interventions</a> . Theoretically, an institution <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/faq/exempt-research-determination/index.html#4109\">could</a> allow investigators to decide for themselves if they are exempt, but this is not recommended, and in practice, essentially all institutions require you to apply for a determination of exemption. In reality, <em>no</em> research is really exempt, it\u2019s just that certain categories of research have a somewhat more lightweight application process. To get a feel for how much friction this adds, here\u2019s <a href=\"https://hrpp.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/10/brief_protocol_for_exempt_research_projects_5.15.2020_4.docx\">U. Michigan\u2019s application for exemption</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Up until the 1990s, IRBs at universities tended to be staffed with faculty \u201cvolunteers\u201d. These were sympathetic to the needs of their colleagues, had little interest in reading (unreadable) federal regulations, and probably just wanted to get back to teaching and research. So IRBs were often pretty loose. But in 1996, Hoiyan Wan died after taking part of an experiment on the effects of smoking and air pollution the University of Rochester. And in 1999, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Gelsinger\">Jesse Gelsinger</a> died after taking an experimental gene therapy at the University Of Pennsylvania. Federal agencies cracked down and sent out hundreds of enforcement letters. Universities nervously responded with \u201chypercompliance\u201d, leading to the IRB process everyone loves today.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-is-the-common-rule-so-common\">Why is the Common Rule so common?</h2>\n\n<p>The 1978 commission recommended that any institution accepting federal funding must apply IRB rules to all research, regardless of funding source. But the written regulations did not follow that recommendation. Theoretically, a university could accept federal funding for some research and still allow other research on human subjects without any IRB approval. But in practice, no university ever does that. Why?</p>\n\n<p>Well, before giving any federal funding to an institution, the government requires the institution to file a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/forms/fwa-instructions/index.html\">Federalwide Assurance</a>\u201d. In this, the institution must promise to obey some \u201cstatement of ethical principles\u201d. Supposedly this could be anything, but it appears that the only correct answer is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Report\">\u201cThe Belmont Report\u201d</a>, an ethics statement issued by the same commission from 1978. Then there is a section where the institution may \u201coptionally\u201d promise to apply the common rule to all research, regardless of funding source.</p>\n\n<p>The government has a <a href=\"https://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/search/fwasearch.aspx\">database</a> of these \u201cassurances\u201d, but you can\u2019t actually read them. Still, I found that a few prominent institutions that had published theirs. They <em>all</em> promised to abide by the Belmont report. Some (<a href=\"https://www.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu/research/documents/IRB/FWA.pdf\">NYU</a>, <a href=\"https://research.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/1-Institutional-Oversight-of-Assurance.pdf\">U. C. Irvine</a>) promised to apply the Common Rule to all research, but most (<a href=\"https://www.mayo.edu/research/documents/mayo-clinic-federalwide-assurance/doc-20144006\">Mayo Clinic</a>, <a href=\"https://irb.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/University-of-Florida-FWA-Exp.-07-06-2028.pdf\">U.

Michigan</a>, <a href=\"https://ras.mit.edu/document/federalwide-assurance-protection-human-subjects\">MIT</a>) do not.</p>\n\n<p>So if you\u2019re a researcher at MIT, can you do non-federally funded research without an IRB? Nope. <a href=\"https://couhes.mit.edu/researchers/frequently-asked-questions\">MIT rules</a> still say you need an IRB for <em>all</em> research with human subjects.  So do the <a href=\"https://www.mayo.edu/research/documents/1-inst-commitment-and-authoritypdf/doc-10027286\">Mayo Clinic\u2019s</a>. So do <a href=\"https://irb.ufl.edu/\">U.

Throughout the 1970s, there was a debate about if IRB rules should apply to social science at all. The <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/index.html\">OHRP</a> (which oversees the Common Rule) gradually asserted <a href=\"https://willyreads.substack.com/p/ethical-imperialism-irbs-and-the\">more and more broad IRB requirements</a>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithiel_de_Sola_Pool\">Ithiel de Sola Pool</a>, a professor at MIT, protested this growing power. Apparently, a colleague had sought IRB approval to interview Boston anti-busing activists, and been rejected because this research could be used against them. Pool <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3556121\">argued</a> that much of social science should be exempt and got support from professional societies.</p>\n\n<p>But no matter. Here\u2019s Charles McCarthy, director of the OHRP from 1977 to 1993, bragging about subverting the Carter and the Reagan administrations to add more regulations during the transition in 1980:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But we were trying to decide when is the appropriate time to get the Secretary to sign off on the new regulations?\u00a0 They had already been proposed, we had got comments from the public.\u00a0 We\u2019d incorporated the comments.\u00a0 We wrote the preamble, it was ready to go.\u00a0 And then when is the best time, \u2018cause Harris could care less whether they every got published.\u00a0 So we talked to the transition team, and they said Reagan will never allow new regulations to see the light of day, so if you\u2019re going to get those out at all, you\u2019d better get them out before he takes over.</p>\n\n  <p>So we\u2019re struggling with this problem, and the way we worked it out was that\u2019s when we wrote, overnight one night\u2013brilliant inspiration\u2013we wrote\u2013everybody stayed in the office, and we worked all night long, and we wrote the exemptions to the regulations, and we also wrote expedited review neither of which had ever been addressed by the Commission.\u00a0 And that\u2019s where they came from.</p>\n\n  <p>Then we went to the transition team, and we said would the transition team endorse regulations that are less stringent than the previous regulations?\u00a0 And, of course, they weren\u2019t, but they looked like they were because we wrote some exceptions.\u00a0 And so when we sent the package down to Harris, we said \u201cDiminished Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects.\u201d\u00a0 And that was the title.\u00a0 And, of course, we knew nobody down there in the last weeks of the Harris administration getting ready to leave office would actually read it.\u00a0 So they didn\u2019t know what all that was about, but they could read the title.</p>\n\n  <p>And so Secretary Harris signed that at her farewell party.\u00a0 She put down her glass of champagne and signed the regulations on January 19, 1980, and went out of office on the 20th.\u00a0 So we squeaked by.\u00a0 Those were some of the adventures we had that were kind of harrowing for regulators, and that\u2019s why some of the language in those exemptions is so convoluted because it was really a first draft.\u00a0 But it survived and it\u2019s still in there.\u00a0 And it makes some sense, but if we could rewrite the regulations, we would run that through three or four more drafts and make them crystal clear.\u00a0 They\u2019re less than elegant writing, whereas if you read the rest of the regulation, I think you\u2019ll find sub-part A is very well-written if you leave out the part about the exemptions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That\u2019s a real quote that you can go read on the <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/education-and-outreach/luminaries-lecture-series/belmont-report-25th-anniversary-interview-cmccarthy/index.html#:~:text=But%20we%20were%20trying\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">hhs.gov</code> website</a> today.</p>\n\n<p>The OHRP sent out \u201cnon-binding guidance\u201d that suggested all research should be subject to IRB review. According to <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/faculty_scholarship/487/\">Hamburger (2007)</a>, in the 1990s, the Federalwide Assurance form implied that institutions <em>had</em> to apply the Common Rule to all research, despite the fact that no federal regulation to this effect existed. I can\u2019t find the old form, but according to \u201cpersons who were in a position to know\u201d, at one point all but about five institutions in the entire country had made this promise.</p>\n\n<p>By 2000-2005, the form made clear that promising to apply the Common Rule (and thus IRBs) to non federally-funded research was optional, and many institutions decline to do this. But they are only declining <em>to make this assurance</em>. Apparently, after years of applying the Common Rule to all research, it had risen to legally qualify as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care\">\u201cstandard of care\u201d</a>, meaning that anyone that failed to apply it risked being legally <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence\">\u201cnegligent \u201c</a> under state law. So, having established the Common Rule as standard through questionably legal tactics, the government could now relax and rely on state tort laws.</p>\n\n<p>Now, say you\u2019re affiliated with a university. Federal funded research without IRB approval is out. <em>Any</em> research at the university is out. But say you want to do research in your spare time, at home, without using any university resources. Is that OK?</p>\n\n<p>Policies here seem to vary. Some are clear that this is <em>not</em> OK. <a href=\"https://irb.ucsf.edu/research-needing-irb-review#who\">U.C. San Francisco</a> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>UCSF faculty, staff,\u00a0or students or researchers at UCSF-affiliated institutions conducting human subjects research require IRB approval before initiating the study. IRB approval is required <strong>regardless of the site of the study or the source of funding</strong> (if there is funding).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Others are a bit ambiguous. <a href=\"https://couhes.mit.edu/researchers/frequently-asked-questions#who_apply\">MIT</a> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Any faculty member, employee or student at MIT who conducts human subjects research must apply [to the IRB] if the research involves any form of MIT involvement or support, including funding, <strong>personnel</strong>, facilities, academic credit or access to experimental subjects.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But how could a MIT <em>employee</em> do research without involving MIT <em>personnel</em>, when they themselves are personnel? The closest I can find to anyone saying it\u2019s OK to do independent research without an IRB is <a href=\"https://research.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/HRPO/IRB_SOP_v5.2_2.12.19_TOC_CUIMC.176a.9.12.19.pdf\">Columbia University</a> which says an IRB is needed if:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the research is conducted by or under the direction of any employee or agent (faculty/student/staff) of Columbia, in connection with his or her institutional responsibilities</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What exactly constitutes a \u201cconnection\u201d? I guess you get to argue about the meaning of that term if/when you\u2019re investigated for research misconduct.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"journals\">Journals</h2>\n\n<p>OK! So if you\u2019re doing any research at any federally funded institution, you need an IRB. If you work at such an institution, you could <em>maybe</em> do research at home, as long as it\u2019s unrelated to your job and you\u2019re willing to live dangerously.</p>\n\n<p>But suppose you\u2019re not affiliated with any institution. Can you do research without an IRB?</p>\n\n<p>One additional barrier is that if you want to <em>publish</em> your results in a journal, almost all journals that publish human subjects research require IRB approval. For example, all <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/editorial-policies/ethics-and-biosecurity#:~:text=identify%20the%20ethics\">Nature journals</a>, <a href=\"https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/journal-author/journal-author-helpdesk/before-you-start#:~:text=reference%20number\">Springer journals</a> , and <a href=\"https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/editorial-policies/research-ethics-guidelines-for-stem-journals/#:~:text=reference\">Taylor and Francis</a>  journals require you to identify the ethics committee and give a reference number. <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/page/science-journals-editorial-policies#:~:text=human%20subjects%20research\">Science</a> journals require IRB approval, but don\u2019t seem to require details unless an editor requests them. (Those are publisher requirements. Specific journals can add additional restrictions.)</p>\n\n<p>Now, I\u2019m not sure how carefully these journals actually <em>check</em>. My impression is that some do and some don\u2019t. Maybe you could lie and get away with it, but papers do in fact <a href=\"https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/lack-of-irb-approval/\">retracted</a> when a lack of IRB approval is revealed.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"state-laws\">State laws</h2>\n\n<p>Another barrier is that some states have their own laws. In 1975, <a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PBH/2444\">New York</a> passed a law that required IRB approval for <em>all</em> human subjects research:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Each person engaged in the conduct of human research or proposing to conduct human research shall affiliate himself with an institution or agency having a human research review committee, and such human research as he conducts or proposes to conduct shall be subject to review by such committee in the manner set forth in this section.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title32.1/chapter5.1/section32.1-162.19/\">Virginia</a> passed a very similar law in 1979. These go further than requiring IRB approval. They make independent human subjects research fully illegal! (Read that quote!) In most states, a random person could submit their research plan to an independent IRB. Not in New York or Virginia.</p>\n\n<p>In 2002, Maryland passed <a href=\"https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2002rs/billfile/hb0917.htm\">house bill 917</a>. I find this text extremely confusing, but <a href=\"https://www.marylandattorneygeneral.gov/Pages/HealthPolicy/humansubject.aspx\">everyone seems to agree</a> that that it means that all human subjects research requires IRB approval.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve seen many people claim that California also requires IRB approval for all human subjects research. While it\u2019s true that California has some <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;division=20.&amp;title&amp;part&amp;chapter=1.3.&amp;article\">extra regulations</a>, as far as I can tell none of these require IRB approval.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"fda-regulations\">FDA regulations</h2>\n\n<p>Have you found all this to be too simple? Too straightforward and legible?</p>\n\n<p>The FDA is here to help. They have an <em>independent</em> set of IRB regulations. While the Common Rule IRB regulations are in <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-A/part-46\">Title 45 Part 46</a> (45 CFR 46), the FDA IRB regulations are in <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-56\">21 CFR 56</a> and also <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-50\">21 CFR 50</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Whereas the Common Rule derives its constitutional authority from the idea that the government can decide how it wants to give out <em>money</em>, the FDA regulations seem derive their constitutional authority from the idea that it is <em>regulating commerce</em>. So FDA regulations apply regardless of where you work or how you\u2019ve gotten funding. The FDA operates according to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act_of_1938\">1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act</a> and its many amendments, most notably the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Supplement_Health_and_Education_Act_of_1994\">1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So what do the FDA regulations say? I found them to be much more painful to read than the (already extremely painful) Common Rule regulations. But after much thrashing and screaming, I think the core regulation is <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-56/section-56.103#p-56.103(a)\">21 CFR 56.103(a)</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[\u2026] any clinical investigation which must meet the requirements for prior submission (as required in parts <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-312\">312</a>, 812, and 813) [\u2026] shall not be initiated unless that investigation has been reviewed [\u2026] by an IRB meeting the requirements of this part.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<details>\n  \n(Click here for details)\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <p>21 CFR \u00a7 56.103 gives a two cases where you\u2019re exempt from the above rule, but these aren\u2019t much help.</p>\n\n      <p>The first (<a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-56/subpart-A/section-56.104\">21 CFR \u00a7 56.104</a>) is that you\u2019re exempt if you meet the conditions of which basically are that (1) you started your investigation in 1981 or earlier (2) it\u2019s an emergency and you get IRB approval within 5 days, or (3) \u201ctaste and food quality evaluations and consumer acceptance studies if wholesome foods without additives are consumed or if a food is consumed that contains a food ingredient at or below the level and for a use found to be safe\u201d.</p>\n\n      <p>The second (<a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-56/subpart-A/section-56.105\">21 CFR \u00a7 56.105</a>) is that you\u2019re exempt if you apply to the FDA to be exempt and they waive the requirements. Good luck with that.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p><a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-56/section-56.103#p-56.103(b)\">21 CFR \u00a7 56.103 (b)</a> says that if you apply to the FDA to get a drug approved, they may ignore your data if you should have gotten an IRB but you didn\u2019t. But this an <em>additional</em>  thing to worry about, not a waiver to do whatever you want if you don\u2019t care about FDA approval.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</details>\n\n<p>So what does this mean?</p>\n\n<p>Well, a \u201cclinical investigation\u201d is defined by <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-56#p-56.102(c)\">21 CFR 56.102(c)</a> to be anything involving human subjects and a \u201ctest article\u201d. And a \u201ctest article\u201d which is defined in turn by <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-56#p-56.102(l)\">21 CFR 56.102(l)</a> to be any \u201cdrug\u201d for human use. So if you\u2019re doing anything with a \u201cdrug\u201d that requires \u201cprior submission\u201d, then you need an IRB. What do <em>those</em> terms mean? <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-312\">21 CFR Part 312</a> makes clear that \u201cprior submission\u201d is referring to an investigational new drug (IND) application to the FDA.</p>\n\n<p>(Caution: An \u201cIRB\u201d and an \u201cIND\u201d are totally different things. An IRB is what this article is about. An <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigational_New_Drug\">IND</a> is the kind of application that pharmaceutical companies make to the FDA before they can start clinical trials.)</p>\n\n<p>So, at first, this seems like good news: As long as you don\u2019t need to do a (gigantic, extremely expensive) IND application to the FDA before starting your research, then FDA regulations don\u2019t force you to use an IRB. Whew! Except\u2026 When are you supposed to submit an IND? Surely that\u2019s not some incredibly broad set of circumstances that could apply to almost anyone doing almost anything, is it?</p>\n\n<p>Behold:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/79386/download\"><img alt=\"Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) \u2014 Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/irb/FDA.png\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This is a supposedly \u201cnonbinding\u201d document that just explains old rules. <em>Supposedly</em>, the FDA is just publishing this as a helpful service to all the mouth-breathers who can\u2019t understand federal regulations. But everyone in industry behaves as if it\u2019s a new law. Which is understandable, since the written regulations are so confusing and ambiguous.</p>\n\n<p>If you read this guidance, you will discover that an IND is needed if:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>The research involves a \u201cdrug\u201d</li>\n  <li>The research is a \u201cclinical investigation\u201d</li>\n  <li>The research is not exempt.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you want to avoid an IND, then (2) and (3) are little help. A \u201cclinical investigation\u201d is <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-312/section-312.3#p-312.3(Clinical%20investigation)\">defined</a> as anything where a \u201cdrug\u201d is given to human subjects. And the exemptions are extremely narrow: They are only for <em>marketed</em> drugs where the drug is being used for the labeled purpose as directed. Testing something already approved for a new disease? Not exempt. Testing if normal food helps with some new disease? Not exempt. You\u2019re only exempt if you\u2019re doing research on something the FDA has already accepted to be true.</p>\n\n<details>\n  \n(Click here for details)\n\n\n  <p>\u201cDo I need an IND if I use a lawfully marketed drug for an unlabeled indication?\nIf you are a health care provider and you prescribe a marketed drug to treat a patient for an\nunlabeled indication (also referred to as off-label use), an IND is not required because this use is\nconsidered to be within the scope of medical practice and not a clinical investigation. However,\nif you use the marketed drug for the same purpose in a clinical investigation intended to evaluate\nthe drug\u2019s ability to treat a disease or condition, an IND is required under part 312 unless the\nclinical investigation meets the criteria for an exemption for studies of lawfully marketed drugs\n(see 21 CFR 312.2(b) and section IV.A of this guidance.\u201d</p>\n\n  <p>\u201cIf a product containing substances generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in food is\nadministered to subjects in a study intended to evaluate the effect of the substance on the\npathogenesis of a human disease, is an IND required?\nSubstances designated as GRAS for use in food are generally not approved as drug products. A\nclinical investigation of a GRAS substance that is intended to evaluate the product\u2019s ability to\ndiagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease requires an IND under part 312, unless the\nsubstance to be studied is also a lawfully marketed drug and the clinical investigation meets the\ncriteria for exemption under 21 CFR 312.2(b).\u201d</p>\n</details>\n\n<p>If you want to avoid an IND, your best hope is that your research doesn\u2019t involve a \u201cdrug\u201d. Unfortunately, the term \u201cdrug\u201d is defined extremely broadly, way beyond the colloquial meaning of  \u201cdrug\u201d in English. A drug is defined to include:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It also includes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Get that? Here\u2019s a little picture:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/irb/drug.pdf\"><img alt=\"drug chart\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/irb/drug.svg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Now, I know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201cThat can\u2019t be right! That would mean that if I wanted to study if some normal food reduced the odds of, say, diabetes, then I wouldn\u2019t just need IRB approval, I would also need to submit a freaking <em>IND</em>! That would be stupid!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But the FDA is quite clear that this <em>is</em> right:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As is the case for a dietary supplement, a food is considered to be a drug if it is \u201cintended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease,\u201d except that a food may bear an authorized health claim about reducing the risk of a disease without becoming a drug (see section VI.D.3). Therefore, a clinical investigation intended to evaluate the effect of a food on a disease would require an IND under part 312. For example, a clinical investigation intended to evaluate the effect of a food on the signs and symptoms of Crohn\u2019s disease would require an IND.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>FDA <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/institutional-review-boards-frequently-asked-questions#:~:text=54.\">also says</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Does a physician, in private practice, conducting research with an FDA regulated product, need to obtain IRB approval?</strong></p>\n\n  <p>Yes. The FDA regulations require IRB review and approval of regulated clinical investigations, whether or not the study involves institutionalized subjects. FDA has included non-institutionalized subjects because it is inappropriate to apply a double standard for the protection of research subjects based on whether or not they are institutionalized.</p>\n\n  <p>An investigator should be able to obtain IRB review by submitting the research proposal to a community hospital, a university/medical school, an independent IRB, a local or state government health agency or other organizations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At first, I thought this couldn\u2019t possibly be true. In 2017, it apparently cost $619,200 to submit an IND application to the FDA. However, in practice it appears that there are <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/72340/download\">many exceptions</a> and that there are <a href=\"https://academicentrepreneurship.pubpub.org/pub/aan4seyc/release/4\">two categories</a> of INDs: Commercial and research. I assume the FDA doesn\u2019t actually try to charge researchers $619,200 to review their research projects, but I don\u2019t really know.</p>\n\n<p>The FDA\u2019s IND application page is <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/investigational-new-drug-ind-application/ind-application-procedures-overview\">here</a>. Have fun.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m not sure how seriously people take these FDA regulations in practice. People <em>do</em> seem to get IND approval for research on actual (chemical) drugs. But does anyone actually seek IND approval if they want to study if diet influences obesity? Do they carefully avoid talking about disease, so they can fall under the looser \u201cstructure and function of the body\u201d? It\u2019s hard to say.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-ive-learned\">What I\u2019ve learned</h2>\n\n<p>Mostly I\u2019ve learned that the set of abstractions I was using to think about the world were wrong. I assumed that there were \u201claws\u201d that someone had written, and that someone could read to understand what is legal and what isn\u2019t.</p>\n\n<p>But in reality, politicians write vague laws, and then agencies write vague sprawling regulations, and then those agencies issue vague \u201cclarifications\u201d. Sometimes these might be unconstitutional or illegal, but no one knows unless they want to fight things in court. But courts are unpredictable, and even going to court is ruinously expensive. Trying to comply with the the written law is like trying to comply with a giant mound of potatoes.</p>\n\n<p>So people basically operate as if the law doesn\u2019t exist. The \u201claw\u201d is what the people who enforce the law choose to enforce. If you need to live in this world, that\u2019s what you pay attention to. The law is what you can get away with.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-i-would-change\">What I would change</h2>\n\n<p>All the IRB rules were designed by medical doctors to regulate the research of other medical doctors, thinking about incidents like the Tuskegee syphilis study.</p>\n\n<p>But here\u2019s an opinion: Needing to submit an application before you can ask people to fill out some simple online survey is stupid. Needing to submit an application before you can interview a bunch of people is stupid.</p>\n\n<p>I like incremental change, so why don\u2019t we start by making \u201cexempt\u201d research <em>actually exempt</em>? For example, <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2018-07-19/title-45/part-46#p-46.104(d)(3)(ii)\">45 CFR 46.104(d)(3)(ii)</a> exempts \u201cbenign behavioral interventions\u201d from IRB review. But you still need to <em>apply</em> to prove you\u2019re exempt. Why?</p>\n\n<p>As an analogy, driving a car is dangerous. Whenever I drive, I could easily kill someone. But the government doesn\u2019t force me to submit a driving plan any time I want to go somewhere. Instead, if I misbehave, I am punished <em>in retrospect</em>. Why don\u2019t we apply the same policy to research?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"notes\">Notes</h2>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>I found AI to be completely useless at parsing all these federal regulations. Maybe you need AI that\u2019s specifically trained to be good at parsing legal text?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Say I want to feed potatoes to my friends and see if that reduces diabetes. Maybe that\u2019s dumb. Fine. But the FDA seems to be claiming that it is constitutionally permitted to regulate this because by doing this I would be engaging in \u201cinterstate commerce\u201d. Really?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Maybe the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_U.S.A.,_Inc._v._Natural_Resources_Defense_Council,_Inc.\"><em>Chevron</em> decision</a> might have some implications for all this?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>As far as I can tell, no one has ever been prosecuted for failure to comply with IRB requirements. It\u2019s not even clear what the penalty would be. In practice, rules are enforced on <em>institutions</em>\u2014if one failed to comply, then their \u201cassurance\u201d might be cancelled, meaning they couldn\u2019t take any federal funding for research. Or, if they wanted to sell something, the FDA might refuse to approve it for sale.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Are you chaotic good? Then you may find it interesting that it seems to be relatively easy to form a new IRB.

You can only grow with it, or bulldoze it and start over from zero.</p><h3>Forking Like a State</h3><p>And that&#8217;s exactly what happens when you try to rebuild an ecosystem. Fixing structural issues means breaking changes. Breaking changes mean forking, and forking has costs:</p><p><em>When you fork an ecosystem, you kill the existing ecosystem's momentum, and start from zero on a new ecosystem.</em></p><p>This doesn&#8217;t stop us from trying. Software history is littered with attempts to fix past mistakes in our ecosystems:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Python3</strong> forked the ecosystem by making breaking changes to fix a number of longstanding mistakes. Strings became unicode by default, print went from being a statement to a function, functions switched from using lists to generators. Good stuff! Yet these longstanding mistakes turned out to be structural, and the fixes difficult to adopt. Keystone frameworks like <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/python3/\">Django</a> and <a href=\"https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0014-dropping-python2.7-proposal.html\">NumPy</a> lagged several years behind in adoption. It took even longer for adoption to propagate through the long tail of the ecosystem. Many developers remained stuck on Python2 due to dependency lock-in. Things remained bifurcated until Python2 was EOL&#8217;d in 2020, forcing a migration. The ecosystem finally caught up <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/11/14/why-is-the-migration-to-python-3-taking-so-long/#h2-a4811b5655860\">12 years after Python3 was released</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>JavaScript</strong> forked the ecosystem by introducing a syntax-breaking module system, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules\">ES modules</a> (import/export). ES modules made significant improvements on Node&#8217;s grassroots module system, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS\">CommonJS modules</a> (require()). Bindings in the new module system became static, making <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking\">tree shaking</a> possible. The breaking syntax change was also <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode#strict_mode_for_modules\">used as a wedge to upgrade the language in other ways</a>. Nevertheless, it took years for browsers to widely support ES module syntax. Node.js took even longer. Build tooling became necessary for shipping code to the browser. Keystone NPM packages continue to use CommonJS, creating practical difficulties with code re-use. ES Modules are widely supported in browsers today, and Node has patched up <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v23.0.0#requireesm-is-now-enabled-by-default\">most of the compatibility issues</a>, but has taken about 10 years, and build tools have become entrenched as a permanent feature of using the language.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deno</strong> forked the ecosystem by ditching node_modules and package.json. Deno aimed to simplify by shedding Node&#8217;s increasingly complex legacy baggage. They ditched build tooling and config by supporting TypeScript, ES Modules, <a href=\"https://deno.com/blog/http-imports\">URL-based imports</a>, web standard APIs, and a sandboxed runtime. However, the lack of support for Node&#8217;s massive <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">NPM ecosystem</a> hindered adoption. Then <a href=\"https://bun.sh/\">Bun</a> launched with full NPM compatibility, and focused on selling performance. <a href=\"https://star-history.com/#nodejs/node&amp;denoland/deno&amp;oven-sh/bun&amp;Timeline\">It rapidly gained traction</a>. Now Deno finds itself playing catch-up. Deno 2 <a href=\"https://deno.com/blog/v2.0\">introduced full NPM compatibility</a>. It also <a href=\"https://deno.com/blog/http-imports\">launched JSR</a>, a new <a href=\"https://deno.com/blog/jsr_open_beta#help-us-level-up-the-javascript-ecosystem\">open source and decentralizable module registry</a>. This is wonderful, but it forks Deno&#8217;s ecosystem yet again, since developers now face a choice between NPM and JSR.</p></li></ul><p>I&#8217;ve also attempted to fork, and for sillier reasons!</p><ul><li><p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/subconsciousnetwork/subtext\">Subtext</a></strong> rationalized Markdown as a simple block-based syntax, side-stepping syntax ambiguities, and making it easier to parse into useful data structures. Then, a few months later, ChatGPT happened, and Markdown was their lingua franca. Rationalizing Markdown became a pointless exercise. LLMs are trained on and will generate Markdown for eternity. It&#8217;s immortal. I should have just gone with Markdown.</p></li></ul><p>What can we learn from all this? Python, ES Modules, Deno, JSR all feel like justified forks to me. They attempt to move the status quo forward in significant ways. And yet every fork is justified. They all happen for good reasons. This doesn&#8217;t change the fact that the costs of forking are high, very high.</p><p>It seems to take about a decade for an ecosystem to recover from a fork. Even so, a lot of shrapnel remains. When the ecosystem finally pieces itself back together, it seldom looks the way we envisioned.</p><p>These examples are comparative successes. More often, our schemes to fix ecosystems simply fail. <a href=\"https://newsletter.squishy.computer/i/145470133/draft-off-of-ecosystem-tailwinds\">Forks turn ecosystem tailwinds into headwinds</a>. You find yourself pushing against the ecosystem, trying to halt its natural momentum so you can point it in a new direction. Even if you you succeed in slowing it down, you&#8217;ll have to keep pushing to get it going again. <a href=\"https://newsletter.squishy.computer/p/soulbinding-like-a-state\">We may rationalize the ecosystem, and kill it in the process</a>.</p><h3>Living systems layer</h3><p>So, if not fix the ecosystem, then what? Add more layers!</p><ul><li><p>Layer stuff on top</p></li><li><p>Let things live side-by-side</p></li><li><p>Allow opt-in</p></li></ul><p>Rich Hickey has a nice bit about this: &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid of <code>foo2()</code>&#8221;.</p><div class=\"youtube-wrap\" id=\"youtube2-oyLBGkS5ICk\"><div class=\"youtube-inner\"></div></div><p><code>foo2()</code>?!

We based it on another game called Don&#8217;t Break The Internet, which has been going on even longer.</p><p>Don&#8217;t Break is an <a href=\"https://newsletter.squishy.computer/p/open-ended-tools-for-infinite-games\">infinite game</a>. We win by keeping the game going, and we&#8217;re still going. <a href=\"https://newsletter.squishy.computer/p/weblike-things\">Let's build more things like that</a>.</p><h3>Don&#8217;t fork the ecosystem</h3><p>An ecosystem is the most valuable thing in the world. If you have an ecosystem, you have <a href=\"https://newsletter.squishy.computer/i/145470133/draft-off-of-ecosystem-tailwinds\">tailwinds behind everything you do</a>. That&#8217;s because ecosystems are nonlinear systems. They refuse to fall into equilibrium. <a href=\"https://newsletter.squishy.computer/p/coevolution-creates-living-complexity\">Living systems want to spiral upwards</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Life improves the closed system's capacity to sustain life. Life&#8212;all life&#8212;is in the service of life. Necessary nutrients are made available to life by life in greater and greater richness as the diversity of life increases.<br /><em>(Frank Herbert, Dune)</em></p></blockquote><p>Ecosystems are rare. They don&#8217;t emerge very often. Our ecosystem, the one on this planet&#8212;<em>life</em>&#8212;arose just once, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_universal_common_ancestor\">as far as we know</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Evolution is no linear family tree, but change in the single multidimensional being that has grown to cover the entire surface of Earth. <em>(Lynn Margulis)</em></p></blockquote><p>So, when a living ecosystem does emerge, we have to cherish it, foster it, despite shortcomings, inelegance, ugliness. All living systems are ugly and a little bit eldritch&#8230; <a href=\"https://newsletter.squishy.computer/p/subconscious-is-squishy-computer\">squishy</a>. That&#8217;s how it is.</p>"
