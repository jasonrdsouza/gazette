                "<div class=\"trix-content\">\n  <div>Consent morality is the idea that there are no higher values or virtues than allowing consenting adults to do whatever they please. As long as they're not hurting anyone, it's all good, and whoever might have a problem with that is by definition a bigot.&nbsp;<br /><br /></div><div>This was the overriding morality I picked up as a child of the 90s. From TV, movies, music, and popular culture. Fly your freak! Whatever feels right is right! It doesn't seem like much has changed since then.<br /><br /></div><div>What a moral dead end.<br /><br /></div><div>I first heard the term consent morality as part of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Case-Against-Sexual-Revolution/dp/1509549994/\">Louise Perry's critique of the sexual revolution</a>. That in the context of hook-up culture, situationships, and falling birthrates, we have to wrestle with the fact that the sexual revolution \u2014 and it's insistence that, say, a sky-high body count mustn't be taboo \u2014 has led society to screwy dating market in the internet age that few people are actually happy with.<br /><br /></div><div>But the application of consent morality that I actually find even more troubling is towards parenthood. As is widely acknowledged now, we're in a bit of <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/children-of-you-a2f93dfa\">a birthrate crisis</a> all over the world. And I think consent morality can help explain part of it.<br /><br /></div><div>I was reminded of this when I posted a <a href=\"https://x.com/dhh/status/1938973491992371316\">cute video of a young girl so over-the-moon excited for her dad getting off work</a> to argue that you'd be crazy to trade <em>that</em> for some nebulous concept of \"personal freedom\". Predictably, consent morality immediately appeared in the comments: Some people just don't want children and that's TOTALLY OKAY and you're actually bad for suggesting they should!<br /><br /></div><div>No. It's the role of a well-functioning culture to guide people towards The Good Life. Not force, but guide. Nobody wants to be convinced by the morality police at the pointy end of a bayonet, but giving up on the whole idea of objective higher values and virtues is a nihilistic and cowardly alternative.<br /><br /></div><div>Humans are deeply <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimetic_theory\">mimetic creatures</a>. It's imperative that we celebrate what's good, true, and beautiful, such that these ideals become collective markers for morality. Such that they guide behavior.<br /><br /></div><div>I don't think we've done a good job at doing that with parenthood in the last thirty-plus years. In fact, I'd argue we've done just about everything to undermine the cultural appeal of the simple yet divine satisfaction of child rearing (and by extension maligned the square family unit with mom, dad, and a few kids).<br /><br /></div><div>Partly out of a coordinated campaign against the family unit as some sort of trad (possibly fascist!) identity marker in a long-waged culture war, but perhaps just as much out of the banal denigration of how <em>boring</em> and <em>limiting</em> it must be to carry such simple burdens as being a father or a mother in modern society.<br /><br /></div><div>It's no wonder that if you incessantly focus on how expensive it is, how little sleep you get, how terrifying the responsibility is, and how much stress is involved with parenthood that it doesn't seem all that appealing!<br /><br /></div><div>This is where Jordan Peterson does <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_H5GG8dW-Bo\">his best work</a>. In advocating for the deeper meaning of embracing burden and responsibility. In diagnosing that much of our modern malaise does not come from carrying too much, but from carrying too little. That a myopic focus on personal freedom \u2014 the nights out, the \"me time\", the money saved \u2014 is a spiritual mirage: You think you want the paradise of nothing ever being asked of you, but it turns out to be the hell of nobody ever needing you.<br /><br /></div><div>Whatever the cause, I think part of the cure is for our culture to reembrace the virtue and the value of parenthood without reservation. To stop centering the margins and their pathologies. To start centering the overwhelming middle where most people make for good parents, and will come to see that role as the most meaningful part they've played in their time on this planet.<br /><br /></div><div>But this requires giving up on consent morality as the only way to find our path to The Good Life. It involves taking a moral stance that some ways of living are better than other ways of living for the broad many. That parenthood is good, that we need more children both for the literal survival of civilization, but also for the collective motivation to guard against the bad, the false, and the ugly.<br /><br /></div><div>There's more to life than what you feel like doing in the moment. The worst thing in the world is not to have others ask more of you. Giving up on the total freedom of the unmoored life is a small price to pay for finding the deeper meaning in a tethered relationship with continuing a bloodline that's been drawn for hundreds of thousands of years before it came to you.<br /><br /></div><div>You're never going to be \"ready\" before you take the leap. If you keep waiting, you'll wait until the window has closed, and all you see is regret. Summon a bit of bravery, don't overthink it, and do your part for the future of the world. It's 2.1 or bust, baby!</div>\n</div>"

I&rsquo;ll see if UberEats delivers up here.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\uddd9: why not call the restaurant?</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc23: are you kidding me? i&rsquo;m not a boomer.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\uddd9: is UberEats a GUI?</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc23: yes?</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\uddd9: does it work well?</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc23: yeah it&rsquo;s fine! gets the job done.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\uddd9: why not chat over the phone instead?</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc23: well, ordering food is the same thing every time! even when you talk to the person you&rsquo;re both just following a script, really. the app just makes it faster to follow that script.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\uddd9: indeed! this is our third precept:</p>\n\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;\">\nGraphical interfaces can make repeated workflows nicer.\n</div>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc23: ok i get it. but idk man, i feel like this is all kinda obvious and we haven&rsquo;t hit the heart of the matter? yes chat is better for open-ended workflows, and GUIs can be better when the task is repeated. but how do they relate?</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\uddd9: hey i host seminars up here every week and it&rsquo;s kinda tedious. could you show me the button in UberEats where I can enter the estimated attendance and then it orders the right number of pizzas?</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc23: umm that&rsquo;s not a thing?</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\uddd9: why not? i want it.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc23: uhh, this is UberEats, not a seminar organizer app?</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\uddd9: oh right good point! in that case let&rsquo;s add a button on the calendar invite i can press which will order the pizzas.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc23: dude what do you mean? the calendar app is just a calendar app, not a seminar organizer. you can&rsquo;t just change your software like this.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\uddd9: hm, what are my options then?</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc23: ooh i have an idea! have you heard of MCP? if we just install the right servers then you can program a seminar planner agent in Claude to do this every week for you.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\uddd9: sounds fine for the first few times while i&rsquo;m figuring it out. but&ndash;is planning a seminar not a repeated workflow?</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc23: &hellip; yes, i think it is?</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\uddd9: did we not say that GUIs can speed up repeated workflows? why do i need to stay in chat for this? also btw, i want my assistant to help out with this, and an app would help them know what to do.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc23: i mean, i&rsquo;m not sure there&rsquo;s a good app for seminar planning that does what you want. lemme search on the app st&ndash;</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\uddd9: wait! a GUI that someone else made will not fit <em>my</em> seminar planning needs. i need my own preferred workflow to be the one that is encoded in the tool.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc23: ohh i see! this actually might not be that much work, have you heard of vibe coding? i&rsquo;ll open up Claude Artifacts and get cookin.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\uddd9: thanks, lemme know when you&rsquo;ve added the seminar pizza feature to UberEats!</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc23: oh well, I was thinking it&rsquo;s not gonna be added to uber eats exactly &ndash; i&rsquo;m gonna make a new web app that does all this.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\uddd9: why? UberEats already has great UI for the checkout flow, I just need one little feature added.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc23: i mean i see your point, but you can&rsquo;t really add your own features to UberEats? you don&rsquo;t control it.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\uddd9: haven&rsquo;t they heard of vibe coding over there?</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc23: dude that&rsquo;s not how software works. sure everyone can code now but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can just edit any app.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\uddd9: why not?</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc23: er&hellip; it sounds kinda messy? and i guess all of this app stuff was invented before AI came along anyway?</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\uddd9: when you paint a wall do you need to ask permission of the company that made the wall?</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc23: &hellip; hm. when you put it that way&hellip; i see what you&rsquo;re getting at. if all the GUIs you already use could be edited, then you wouldn&rsquo;t need to resort to chat as much to fill in the seams. instead you could just change the GUIs to do what you want!</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\uddd9: aha! yes, now you see. if the UI is fixed, then it cannot respond to my needs. but if it is <em>malleable</em>, then I can evolve it over time. This is the fourth and final precept for today:</p>\n\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;\">\nA malleable UI pairs the ergonomics of GUIs with the open-ended flexibility of chat.\n</div>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc23: neat. this seems hard though, wouldn&rsquo;t we need to rethink how the App Store works?</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\uddd9: indeed. and that is a longer conversation for another time.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>Note from the editor: to keep exploring, <a href=\"https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/malleable-software/\">read this</a>.</em></p>"
