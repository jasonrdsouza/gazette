</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"my-iphone-is-too-old-for-the-av1-video-codec\">My iPhone is too old for the AV1 video codec</h2>\n\n<p>Doing some research online gave me the answer quickly: the broken videos use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Av1\">AV1 codec</a>, which isn\u2019t supported on my iPhone.\nAV1 is a modern video codec that\u2019s designed to be very efficient and royalty free, but it\u2019s only been recently supported on Apple devices.</p>\n\n<p>I have an iPhone 13 mini with an A15 processor.\nMy iPhone doesn\u2019t have hardware decoding support for AV1 videos \u2013 that only came with the iPhone 15 Pro and the A17 Pro.\nThis support was included in all subsequent chips, including the M4 Pro in my Mac Mini.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s theoretically possible for Apple to decode AV1 in software, but they haven\u2019t.\nAccording to Roger Pantos, who works on Apple\u2019s media streaming team, <a href=\"https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/hls-interest/yGhxnphS6jYWmHHa14BZMk2sB8o/\">there are no plans</a> to provide software decoding for AV1 video.\nThis means that if your chip doesn\u2019t have this support, you\u2019re out of luck.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to see if I could have worked this out myself.\nI couldn\u2019t find any references or documentation for Apple\u2019s video codec support \u2013 so failing that, is there some query or check I could run on my devices?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"checking-compatibility-with-web-apis\">Checking compatibility with web APIs</h2>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve found a couple of APIs I can use that tell me my browser can play a particular video.\nThese APIs are used by video streaming sites to make sure they send you the correct video.\nFor example, YouTube can work out that my iPhone doesn\u2019t support AV1 video, so they\u2019ll stream me a video that uses a different codec.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"getting-the-mime-type-and-bitrate-for-the-video\">Getting the MIME type and bitrate for the video</h3>\n\n<p>The APIs I found require a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MIME_type\">MIME type</a> and bitrate for the video.</p>\n\n<p>A MIME type can be something simple like <code>video/mp4</code> or <code>image/jpeg</code>, but it can also include information about the video codec.\nThe codec string for AV1 is quite complicated, and includes many parts.\nIf you want more detail, read the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/codecs_parameter#av1\">AV1 codecs docs on MDN</a> or the <a href=\"https://aomediacodec.github.io/av1-isobmff/#codecsparam\">Codecs Parameter String section</a> of the AV1 spec.</p>\n\n<p>We can get the key information about the unplayable video using <code>ffprobe</code>:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"language-shell\"><code>ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 <span class=\"p\">\\</span>\n    -show_entries stream=codec_name,profile,level,bits_per_raw_sample <span class=\"p\">\\</span>\n    -of default=noprint_wrappers=1 <span class=\"s2\">\"input.mp4\"</span>\n<span class=\"c\"># codec_name=av1</span>\n<span class=\"c\"># profile=Main</span>\n<span class=\"c\"># level=8</span>\n<span class=\"c\"># bits_per_raw_sample=N/A</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The AV1 codec template is <code>av01.P.LLT.DD</code>, which we construct as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<code>P</code> = profile number, and \u201cMain\u201d means <code>0</code>\n</li>\n  <li>\n<code>LL</code> = a two-digit level number, so <code>08</code>\n</li>\n  <li>\n<code>Tier</code> = the tier indicator, which can be Main or High.\nI think the \u201cHigh\u201d tier is for professional workflows, so let\u2019s assume my video is Main or <code>M</code>.</li>\n  <li>\n<code>DD = the two-digit bit depth, so </code>08`.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This gives us the MIME type for the unplayable video:</p>\n<pre><code>video/mp4; codecs=av01.0.08M.08\n</code></pre>\n<p>I also got the MIME type for an H.264 video which does play on my iPhone:</p>\n<pre><code>video/mp4; codecs=avc1.640028\n</code></pre>\n<p>By swapping out the argument to <code>-show_entries</code>, we can also use ffprobe to get the resolution, frame rate, and bit rate:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"language-shell\"><code>ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 <span class=\"p\">\\</span>\n  -show_entries stream=width,height,bit_rate,r_frame_rate <span class=\"p\">\\</span>\n  -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=0 <span class=\"s2\">\"input.mp4\"</span>\n<span class=\"c\"># width=1920</span>\n<span class=\"c\"># height=1080</span>\n<span class=\"c\"># r_frame_rate=24000/1001</span>\n<span class=\"c\"># bit_rate=1088190</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we have this information, let\u2019s pass it to some browser APIs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"htmlmediaelement-canplaytype\">HTMLMediaElement: <code>canPlayType()</code>\n</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/canPlayType\"><code>video.canPlayType()</code> method</a> on HTMLMediaElement takes a MIME type, and tells you whether a browser is likely able to play that media.\nNote the word \u201clikely\u201d: possible responses are \u201cprobably\u201d, \u201cmaybe\u201d and \u201cno\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an example using the MIME type of my AV1 video:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"n\">video</span> = document<span class=\"p\">.</span>createElement<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">video</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\nvideo<span class=\"p\">.</span>canPlayType<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">video/mp4; codecs=av01.0.08M.08</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let\u2019s run this with few different values, and compare the results:</p>\n\n\n\n<table class=\"results\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>MIME type</th>\n    <th>iPhone</th>\n    <th>Mac</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tbody><tr>\n    <td>\n      AV1 video<br />\n      <code>video/mp4; codecs=av01.0.08M.08</code>\n    </td>\n    <td>\n<code>\"\"</code> (= \u201cno\u201d)</td>\n    <td><code>\"probably\"</code></td>\n  </tr></tbody>\n  <tbody><tr>\n    <td>\n      H.264 video<br />\n      <code>video/mp4; codecs=avc1.640028</code>\n    </td>\n    <td><code>\"probably\"</code></td>\n    <td><code>\"probably\"</code></td>\n  </tr></tbody>\n  <tbody><tr>\n    <td>\n      Generic MP4<br />\n      <code>video/mp4</code>\n    </td>\n    <td><code>\"maybe\"</code></td>\n    <td><code>\"maybe\"</code></td>\n  </tr></tbody>\n  <tbody><tr>\n    <td>\n      Made-up format<br />\n      <code>video/mp4000</code>\n    </td>\n    <td>\n<code>\"\"</code> (= \u201cno\u201d)</td>\n    <td>\n<code>\"\"</code> (= \u201cno\u201d)</td>\n  </tr></tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>This confirms the issue: my iPhone can\u2019t play AV1 videos, while my Mac can.</p>\n\n<p>The generic MP4 is a clue about why this API returns a \u201clikely\u201d result, not something more certain.\nThe MIME type doesn\u2019t contain enough information about whether a video will be playable.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mediacapabilities-decodinginfo\">MediaCapabilities: <code>decodingInfo()</code>\n</h3>\n\n<p>For a more nuanced answer, we can use the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaCapabilities/decodingInfo\"><code>decodingInfo()</code> method</a> in the <code>MediaCapabilities</code> API.\nYou pass detailed information about the video, including the MIME type and resolution, and it tells you whether the video can be played \u2013 and more than that, whether the video can be played in a smooth and power-efficient way.</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of how you use it:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"k\">await</span> <span class=\"nb\">navigator</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">mediaCapabilities</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">decodingInfo</span><span class=\"p\">({</span>\n  <span class=\"na\">type</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span

<span class=\"na\">contentType</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">video/mp4; codecs=av01.0.08M.08</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">width</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>     <span class=\"mi\">1920</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">height</span><span

class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">framerate</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">24</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">});</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// {powerEfficient: false,</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">//  smooth: false,</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">//  supported: false,</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">//  supportedConfiguration: Object}</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let\u2019s try this with two videos:</p>\n\n<table class=\"results\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th colspan=\"2\">AV1 video</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Video config</td>\n      <td><pre><code>{\n  contentType: \"video/mp4; codecs=av01.0.08M.08\",\n  width:     1920,\n  height:    1080,\n  bitrate:   1088190,\n  framerate: 24\n}</code></pre></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>iPhone</td>\n      <td>not supported</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Mac</td>\n      <td>supported, smooth, power efficient</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th colspan=\"2\">H.264 video</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Video config</td>\n      <td><pre><code>{\n  contentType: \"video/mp4; codecs=avc1.640028\",\n  width:     1440,\n  height:    1080,\n  bitrate:   1660976,\n  framerate: 24\n}</code></pre></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>iPhone</td>\n      <td>supported, smooth, power efficient</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Mac</td>\n      <td>supported, smooth, power efficient</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>This re-confirms our theory that my iPhone\u2019s lack of AV1 support is the issue.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting that this is still a heuristic, not a guarantee.\nI plugged some really large numbers into this API, and my iPhone claims it could play a trillion-pixel H.264 encoded video in a smooth and power efficient way.\nI know Apple\u2019s hardware is good, but it\u2019s not that good.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-am-i-going-to-do-about-this\">What am I going to do about this?</h2>\n\n<p>This is only an issue because I have a single video file, it\u2019s encoded with AV1, and I have a slightly older iPhone.\nCommercial streaming services like YouTube, Vimeo and TikTok don\u2019t have this problem because they store videos with multiple codecs, and use browser APIs to determine the right version to send you.</p>\n\n<p>Apple would like me to buy a new iPhone, but that\u2019s overkill for this problem.\nThat will happen eventually, but not today.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, I\u2019m going to convert any AV1 encoded videos to a codec that my iPhone can play, and change my <a href=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2025/yt-dlp-wrapper/\">downloader script</a> to do the same to any future downloads.\nBefore I understood the problem, I was playing whack-a-mole with broken videos.\nNow I know that AV1 encoding is the issue, I can find and fix all of these videos in one go.</p>\n\n\n

                "<p>(You should read <a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/archives/so-you-want-to-be-promoted-pt-1/\">Part 1</a> first)</p>\n<p>The elephant in the room. You are wondering why I am putting so much of the burden of being promoted on you. You have a boss. Aren&#8217;t they responsible for doing all this work? Shouldn&#8217;t they understand job levels and the intricacies of the promotion process?</p>\n<p>Yes, they should.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the word &#8220;should&#8217; for a bit. Should doesn&#8217;t mean they will, it means they could. Should indicates a desirable future state, not a defined future. Your manager should understand your job level, and they should have a plan for your eventual promotion, but have they? The Big Three, the hardest and highest risk conversations new managers have with an individual, revolve around:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Space <sup id=\"fnref-5375-1\"><a class=\"jetpack-footnote\" href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/feed/#fn-5375-1\" title=\"Read footnote.\">1</a></sup></li>\n<li>Title</li>\n<li>Compensation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The promotion conversation hits two of the Big Three, and sometimes it&#8217;s all three when the promotion involves a new office. Managers, especially new managers, walk into these conversations thinking it&#8217;s just another conversation, but the Big Three are the hardest because they aren&#8217;t about space, title, and compensation; they are answers to fundamental questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Where do I live?</li>\n<li>What do I do?</li>\n<li>How am I valued?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A lack of experience in both preparing for and having these questions will not just make for awkward conversations, but often irrevocable blows to professional trust. So, yeah, your manager should be ready to discuss your promotion, but if they&#8217;ve screwed it up before, they might avoid it until the last possible moment.</p>\n<p>So, let&#8217;s help them prepare.</p>\n<h2>Simplify</h2>\n<p>This article began with a simple realization after being a part of vastly different and innumerable promotion processes. There are two core, well-defined deliverables supporting your next promotion:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A Pinnacle Accomplishment</li>\n<li>Network of Trustworthy Feedback </li>\n</ol>\n<p>You are wondering about that job level document from <a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/archives/so-you-want-to-be-promoted-pt-1\">Part 1</a>. It has an impressive list of focus areas and expectations that grow increasingly complex with each level. How can these two deliverables address all of those attributes?</p>\n<p>They might not.</p>\n<p>If there are clearly defined expectations for your role, I recommend understanding them and reflecting on whether or not you&#8217;re achieving them. There are likely a couple in there where you are ignoring or are less adept at than others<sup id=\"fnref-5375-2\"><a class=\"jetpack-footnote\" href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/feed/#fn-5375-2\" title=\"Read footnote.\">2</a></sup>, but I&#8217;ve been in the room where we make the decision, and it consistently boils down to two questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What significant work did they achieve?</li>\n<li>Who do we trust that agrees?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with significant work.</p>\n<h2>A Pinnacle Achievement</h2>\n<p>This is a set of work, a deliverable, or an accomplishment that demonstrates you are capable of working at your next job level. There&#8217;s a significant assumption baked into this sentence that you need to digest. <em>You mean I am expected to work at a higher level before I am promoted?</em></p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p><em>But I haven&#8217;t worked at that level before. How do you expect me to do work where I have no experience?</em></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the rub. Your job is to figure out how to do that work (with help) before you&#8217;re promoted to that level. I will acknowledge that this is a prerequisite at the company I&#8217;ve worked for the last three decades, and your company&#8217;s culture might be different. Still, you know the places I&#8217;ve worked, and if you think that this <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaellopp/\">set of companies</a> got it wrong, I&#8217;m not sure if much of my writing will resonate with you, but keep reading, ok?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to understand this without specifics, so here are real-world examples of what I&#8217;d consider Pinnacle work at three levels: junior, experienced, and senior engineers.</p>\n<p><strong>Junior:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contribute significantly to the development of a feature. </li>\n<li>Support driving a key metric from X to Y.</li>\n<li>Maintain an existing feature with no drama. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Experienced:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive a new feature from design through development and finally deployment.</li>\n<li>Define a new engineering process that was adopted widely with an obvious measurable impact. </li>\n<li>Identify a critical learning for the service/product/process and transformed that idea into a product improvement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Senior:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drove a major new feature that required significant cross-functional work. </li>\n<li>Led a substantive initiative within engineering that greatly affected engineering productivity.</li>\n<li>Solved a complex issue that required collaboration across the entire company.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Real-world is a stretch for these examples. You need to plug in the specifics of your company, the products or services, and your culture. Good news, unless you&#8217;re the CEO, you have a boss, and it&#8217;s as crucial that they either define or critique this work and agree that it&#8217;s sufficient.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to type that again because this step is critical. You need to suggest to your boss that you consider a piece of work to be grounds for promotion, and then you need to listen hard to their response. The goals in this conversation are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are they clear that you are working to get promoted?</li>\n<li>Is this set of work sufficient to support a promotion? If not, why? </li>\n<li>If this work is insufficient, what similar projects are?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s a massive red flag if you leave this conversation either confused or without a concrete set of next steps to get to less confusion. It&#8217;s ok if this conversation takes a couple of attempts, but if you&#8217;ve done it three times and you can&#8217;t define a set of promotion-worthy work with your manager, then\u2026 you might be talking to the wrong person.</p>\n<p>Yikes.</p>\n<p>But it happens. There exist companies where even the managers wonder about the black art of promotions. Where the process happens in a black hole of a room, where information goes in, but can never escape. Sorry. In this unlikely case, my recommendation is to figure out who is in that room and get their advice.</p>\n<p>Nervous about talking with other humans? Good news, you&#8217;re going to be doing it\u2026. a lot.</p>\n<h2>A Network of Trustworthy Feedback</h2>\n<p>Chances are, the folks who are reviewing your promotion are not directly familiar with your work. The likelihood of this occurring increases as a function of the size of your organization, so how are they going to know if you are ready for a promotion? Yes, you have documented your Pinnacle Achievement in great detail, an Achievement that your manager agrees is worthy. Your manager might even be in the room discussing this promotion and is capable of representing you and your fine work. There are a lot of scenarios where this is insufficient. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your manager is not a part of the committee, or, </li>\n<li>Your manager is present, but does not have sufficient context, or, </li>\n<li>Your manager is there, has context, but is not trusted by other members, so they ask, &#8220;Who else agrees this Pinnacle work was Pinnacle?&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For any achievement, there are a handful of humans around the work that you need to cultivate so that when it comes to promotion time, if they are asked, &#8220;Did this person do this work well?&#8221; they enthusiastically respond, &#8220;Why yes. It was fully Pinnacle.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But who? And how?</p>\n<p>It varies by the work, but there are always a set of humans surrounding your work. They might be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fellow engineers are contributing to the same project.</li>\n<li>Partner teams need this feature to be done in order for them to complete their features.</li>\n<li>Quality, support, or other partners teams who worked closely on the development and can intelligently comment on the effort.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think of these humans as customers. Who needs this work to succeed, and how can I best deliver that work to them? You need to be aware of who these humans are and their evolving impression of your work.</p>\n<p>This relationship does not start with you identifying these humans and declaring, &#8220;Hey, so my boss and I agree this is Pinnacle, and I&#8217;m really looking to get promoted, so it&#8217;d be super if you could eventually support me in this effort.&#8221; This starts by identifying which humans are critical to the success of this project and making sure they, like you, are successful. The word &#8220;promotion&#8221; is never uttered.</p>\n<p>Like the Pinnacle Achievement, the amount of work you need to do here scales with the seniority of the role. The group of humans you support as a junior engineer is a much smaller list than the lengthy list of humans necessary to ship a major feature as a senior engineer. Also, the different types of humans increase, as well. For a more senior role, you might have senior engineers, Directors, and VPs on your list of customers.<sup id=\"fnref-5375-3\"><a class=\"jetpack-footnote\" href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/feed/#fn-5375-3\" title=\"Read footnote.\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>As I don&#8217;t know what your Pinnacle Achievement is, I can&#8217;t advise on how to make you and your customer successful, but you should schedule time outside of regular meetings devoted to the project to check in. 1;1s, a lunch, a walk around the block. The goal is to get their perspective. How&#8217;s the work proceeding? Are they feeling progress? Where are they blocked? How can you help? Promotion aside, this is a practice you should deploy for any project of significance with as many disparate humans as possible because complex systems fail in small ways quietly before they fail spectacularly\u2026 and loudly.</p>\n<p>How do you know you identified the right customers? How do you know when they will share a positive report of your work? How do you know they did? You probably won&#8217;t, but the list you want to have ready is when your boss asks, &#8220;How can I talk about this work?&#8221;</p>\n<h2>The Elephant in the Room</h2>\n<p>&#8230; is that every promotion process is different. There are critical aspects to your process that are as important as defining a critical project and having a trusted set of supporters. This is why I suggest that you figure this out first. As a manager, when I know I have a tricky promotion coming up for one of my directs, I find the last person who received this promotion and talk with the manager. What worked? What didn&#8217;t work? How long did it take? I&#8217;m looking for a successful playbook that I can use. It&#8217;s harder to find these stories as an individual because many organizations don&#8217;t broadcast promotions, but some do. Find those folks; learn the playbook that worked for them.</p>\n<p>And understand your promotion might not be approved. Sorry. The reasons are myriad, and if the manager said it was a sure thing, they were wrong. However, once you get past the disappointment, the one piece of information you are looking for in the process is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where was my performance insufficient?</li>\n<li>What do I need to do to improve?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your manager can&#8217;t provide helpful versions of these answers, keep asking. If they can&#8217;t answer, ask others who&#8217;ve been successful.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d say good luck, but luck has nothing to do with your promotion; it&#8217;s just hard work.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-5375-1\">\nNot joking. If you haven&#8217;t moved a team from one space to another, it creates heretofore unimaginable drama for managers.&#160;<a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/feed/#fnref-5375-1\" title=\"Return to main content.\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-5375-2\">\nIf someone is going to have an issue with this piece, it&#8217;s this part. A well-written job level document captures detailed, specific expectations for a role, but, well, we usually cast the net too wide. It&#8217;s every single possible expectation rather than a subset of required expectations. Which apply to you with your experience and in that specific team? It depends on too many to list. I continue to believe that Pinnacle and Network of Trustworthy Feedback are the correct moves, but you may also need to know what specifics from your level that actually matter. Which? The best way is talk to someone who has been recently promoted is not to ask about promotion specifics, but how they measured. If your company encourages promotion secrecy, well, that&#8217;s another problem.&#160;<a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/feed/#fnref-5375-2\" title=\"Return to main content.\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-5375-3\">\nAn essential point about more senior promotions.

The second-most-populous - and fifth-largest, and most-pretentiously-named - is Grand Bahama, home of Freeport, the archipelago&#8217;s second city.</p><p>Grand Bahama has a unique history. In 1955, it was barely inhabited, with only 500 people scattered across a few villages. The British colonial government turned it into a charter city, awarding the charter to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Groves\">Wallace Groves</a>, an American whose Wikipedia article describes him as a &#8220;financier and fraudster&#8221; and includes section titles like &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Groves#Suspicions\">Suspicions</a>&#8221;, &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Groves#Legal_troubles\">Legal Troubles</a>&#8221;, &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Groves#Investigations\">Investigations</a>&#8221;, and &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Groves#Allegations_of_underworld_association\">Allegations Of Underworld Connections</a>&#8221;. He was . . . maybe the exact right person for the job, turning Grand Bahama into a Vegas of the Caribbean complete with casinos, jet-setters, swanky hotels, and a flourishing mob presence. Outside the glitzy center, a little heavy industry even managed to develop around the port. After twenty years, the charter zone was &#8220;the most modern, well-run, and prosperous part of the [Bahamas]&#8221;, and the population had increased to 15,000.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e8na!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b84b513-e2a3-45b8-9bba-ee0d5e02ac1e_400x278.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"325.26\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e8na!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b84b513-e2a3-45b8-9bba-ee0d5e02ac1e_400x278.jpeg\" title=\"\" width=\"468\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Vintage Freeport.

The government, headed towards independence from Britain, became embarrassed by the private enclave and stripped away some of its rights. Around the same time, Florida liberalized its gambling regime, cutting off the flood of Floridians coming to play the slots. Control of the concession passed from Groves, to his business partners, to his business partner&#8217;s widow, and finally to a random collection of only mildly-interested heirs. Two big hurricanes in 2004 were the last straw. Grand Bahama is still a popular cruise destination, it still has a well-built port and surprisingly nice airport, and some of the old hotels still stand. But nobody would describe it as a happening place.</p><p>Now it&#8217;s back in the news. The government <a href=\"https://www.tribune242.com/news/2024/apr/08/pm-told-gbpas-owners-i-have-no-confidence-you/\">is increasingly tired</a> of the heirs&#8217; mismanagement of the island. They want it back. They made what they considered <a href=\"https://www.tribune242.com/news/2023/nov/22/govt-ready-step-plate-and-buy-gbpa/\">a fair offer</a>. One of the heirs - the St. George family - seems to be on board. The other - the Hayward family - is less cooperative. The government is playing hardball by suing for $357 million of back fees which they say the heirs owe (the heirs deny that they owe this). The case is currently in arbitration. A likely outcome is that the court agrees the heirs owe some amount of money, the heirs can&#8217;t afford it, and they agree to sell back to the government.</p><p>Why does this interest us? The government has talked a big talk about the existing owners not doing enough to exploit Freeport&#8217;s economic potential. But the government also isn&#8217;t well-placed to exploit it. And they might need some extra cash to buy back control at a fair price. So rumor is that if the heirs decide to sell, instead of the government taking the island back themselves, they might choose to partner with one of the more modern Silicon-Valley-style charter city companies, and give <em>them</em> the charter. The legal agreement is already set up. They&#8217;d just need to change the name on the dotted line.</p><p>Put this way, Grand Bahama seems like a great deal. It&#8217;s a duty-free zone with one of the best deepwater ports in the area, making it an ideal center for trans-shipment - loading goods from one ship to another for various logistical and legal reasons. With its lovely climate, low prices, and proximity to the United States (50 miles from Miami), it&#8217;s well-placed to be a hub for digital nomads and remote work. Gambling is still legal there. Cruise ships visit regularly.

Enough local NIMBYs protested that the company and county jointly withdrew the initiative in favor of seeking some other agreement. In 2025, they announced their new strategy: they would partner with nearby Suisun City. Suisun would annex their land and permit development there, avoiding a county-wide referendum (they might also make a deal with another nearby city, Rio Vista).</p><p>The new plan is moving forward: earlier this month, California Forever submitted their annexation paperwork, which was deemed complete by the city. The remaining steps are:</p><ol><li><p>Suisun City Council must approve their environmental impact report (may cause delays and added expense, but unlikely to block the project outright)</p></li><li><p>Suisun City Council must approve the annexation (city council has already voted in favor of California Forever before and will likely do so again)</p></li><li><p>The Solano County Local Agency Formation Commission - a county-level body of two supervisors, two local mayors, and a public member - must approve the annexation (may be complicated; lots of room for NIMBYs to cause problems here)</p></li><li><p>Period where locals in the area to be annexed may protest (there aren&#8217;t really any locals except some landowners who have already sold their land to the project, so legally relevant protests are unlikely)</p></li></ol><p>The paperwork itself contains some exciting details.

Getting architecture right in a way that is also scalable and affordable is hard. And until now, we&#8217;ve been focused on the things &#8220;lower down in the stack&#8221; that need to be designed first &#8211; land use plans, urban design, transportation, open space, infrastructure, etc. But I started this company nearly a decade ago precisely because I felt that so much of our world had become ugly, and I wanted to live, and have my kids grow up, in a place that appreciates craft and beauty.</p></blockquote><p>This is one of the clearest examples of what I love about model cities. There are lots of things that everyone (or at least a substantial proportion) of people want, which people aren&#8217;t doing - not because there&#8217;s some strong opposition or technical challenges, but because the system is too complex/diffuse/ossified to permit change. A lot of what I love about California is downstream of its geography as the westernmost part of the western world - the people who felt confined by Europe fled to America, and the people who felt confined by America fled to California, and until recently it was an open space big enough for new experiments to grow. I think of &#8220;California Forever&#8221; as a nod to that heritage, and a test of whether some of those sparks still survive.</p><h2>The Siege Of Prospera</h2><p>In the 2010s, a conservative Honduran government decided to allow experimental &#8220;ZEDEs&#8221; - semi-autonomous charter cities - in the country. Several projects sprung up, most notably Prospera and Ciudad Morazan, and met some early success.</p><p>In 2022, the socialists took over and decided to end the experiment. They were able to ban the creation of new ZEDEs, but had more trouble disbanding existing projects. They found there were two legal roadblocks. First, the founders of the ZEDE system - well aware of how sudden shifts in governments could destroy charter cities - fortified their law with constitutional protections making it near-impossible to repeal. Second, they signed international treaties giving charter city investors the right to sue Honduras for very large amounts if it tried to destroy their hard work.</p><p>How do you repeal a law that says it would be unconstitutional to repeal it? The socialist-controlled Honduran Supreme Court tried their best, saying that the law had retroactively itself been unconstitutional, and so existing ZEDEs had retroactively been illegal the whole time. However, the court failed to remove the entire thicket of legal protection surrounding the ZEDE system; in particular, they did not strike down Article 94 of the Constitution, which said that unconstitutionality rulings could not be enforced retroactively. So as far as anyone can tell, the current status of ZEDEs is that it is illegal for them to exist, but also illegal for the government to take any action to remove them. On their way out, the Court ordered some penalties against &#8220;companies that became ZEDEs&#8221;, which is not really how this works (companies can found ZEDEs, but they don&#8217;t become ZEDEs; this is like saying &#8220;companies that became cell phones&#8221;) and which therefore nobody has tried to collect.</p><p>Why did the government&#8217;s case end so farcically? Honduras-watchers suggest that the Court was trying to balance its obligations to the government, to the integrity of the legal system, and to practicality. The government really wanted an anti-ZEDE victory to present to its voters. The integrity of the legal system made it hard to apply ex post facto judgments. And practically, the whole case ran up against the second layer of protections the ZEDE founders built around their project: the investor treaties. If Honduras were to end ZEDEs, ZEDE investors could sue in international court. Prospera&#8217;s investors have already sued for $11 billion - a third of Honduras&#8217; GDP. The case is currently tied up in international courts, with the delay being amenable to both sides; the government expects to lose, and the Prosperans would rather keep the suit as a threat they can hold over the Hondurans&#8217; head than actually get a judgment in their favor - which would be bad PR, and which they expect Honduras would not pay.</p><p>(also, although the Trump administration hasn&#8217;t taken a firm stance, Prospera seems like the sort of thing they would like, and Honduras is nervous about offending them too badly)</p><p>Since the government doesn&#8217;t seem to be able to legally shut down Prospera, they&#8217;ve resorted to harassing it - especially trying to debank it. This might have worked, if not for the fact that a certain $4 trillion weird Ponzi casino industry has always imagined itself as having a fig-leaf purpose of &#8220;what if a utopian libertarian island-city got debanked by a repressive socialist government and could only save itself if there were a entirely new kind of financial infrastructure totally different from the regular one?&#8221;; although I imagine they were just as surprised as anyone else when this exact scenario suddenly played out in real life, nobody can deny they were extremely prepared for it. So the attempted harassment has fallen flat too, and the government doesn&#8217;t have a lot of options.</p><p>Further developments hinge on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Honduran_general_election\">next month&#8217;s big election</a>.

He grew up in Britain, worked in business and finance, then went back to his family homeland as an adult. Moved by the poverty he saw around him, he decided to start a charter city. </p><p>He recruited the help of Idris Elba, a famous British actor of Sierra Leonean descent, and together they started a company to build <a href=\"https://sherbroislandcity.com/\">Sherbro Island City</a>. The usual Dubai and Singapore comparisons were made. Maybe due to Stevens&#8217; government connections, they got an impressively broad concession from the government - the Charter Cities Institute has compared it to Honduras&#8217; ZEDEs, among the most autonomous charter city legislation in the world. </p><p>From <a href=\"https://chartercitiesinstitute.org/podcast/charter-cities-podcast-episode-74-siaka-stevens-on-building-sherbro-island-city/\">the podcast</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Okay, so there are seven governing board members and the agreement specifically states that they are strictly from the private sector. SAP, our company, will choose four of the board members and the chairperson and the government of Sierra Leone will choose three. That&#8217;s the seven member board. And underneath that is a similar structure to municipal corporation. We have fiscal and legislative autonomy. English common law, very robust investor protections. The best way to kind of describe it, a similar situation, mean, Hong Kong now actually, and it&#8217;s a similar setup to Hong Kong and China&#8217;s relationship in the early eighties, where you have a special administrative region that is very autonomous, but sovereignty is held by the main Sierra Leone country. So it&#8217;s an innovative kind of new system of governance.</p></blockquote><p>Stevens calls the island a &#8220;greenfield&#8221; site, but it includes a town (Bonthe, population ~10,000) and an ethnic group (the Sherbro people).</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w7Zj!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01bfbd8-7896-4274-946e-fe0659c9cd5a_920x613.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"382.4586956521739\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w7Zj!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb01bfbd8-7896-4274-946e-fe0659c9cd5a_920x613.jpeg\" width=\"574\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Yup, that&#8217;s definitely an ethnic group.

Various local chiefs seem to be mostly in favor, as far as we know.</p><p>The big problem for these island charter city attempts is infrastructure. You eventually want heavy industry and high-value-add manufacturing, but how do you build up enough civilization - transit, power, labor, amenities - to support these expensive enterprises? Every charter city has its own solution - gambling in Grand Bahama, regulatory arbitrage in Prospera, political alignment in Praxis. Sherbro&#8217;s plans include:</p><ul><li><p>A hub to lure the Sierra Leone diaspora back to the country (Google says the Sierra Leone diaspora is 336,000 people, most of whom are probably not digital nomads or jet-setters)</p></li><li><p>A place for African-Americans to come to reconnect with their roots (as a white person, I would not dare speak for African-Americans, so they will have to say for themselves whether their pride in their heritage takes the form of a desire to visit a mostly-empty island off the coast of Sierra Leone)</p></li><li><p>Tourism</p></li><li><p>A financial hub for the region (&#8221;Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Guinea, Senegal . . . they&#8217;re all within a three hour flight radius of there&#8221;)</p></li></ul><p>None of these sound very compelling to me, but sometimes you just have to survive long enough to find your true niche and pivot.</p><p>On the other hand, the history of African model cities backed by diaspora celebrities isn&#8217;t great. In 2022, the African-American rapper Akon said he was going to build a &#8220;real-life Wakanda&#8221; in Senegal called &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akon_City\">Akon City</a>&#8221;; also, it would be on the blockchain.

A lot of you should likely skip most of the in-the-weeds discussions.\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are The Problems</h4>\nThere are a few distinct phenomena we have reason to worry about:\n<ol>\n \t<li>Several things that we group together under the (somewhat misleading) title \u2018AI psychosis,\u2019 <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/176354568/you-drive-me-crazy\">ranging from</a> <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/172792546/say-it-back\">reinforcing crank ideas</a> or making people think they\u2019re always right in relationship fights to causing actual psychotic breaks.\n<div> <span id=\"more-24819\"></span> </div>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Thebes referred to this as three problem modes: The LLM as a social relation that draws you into madness, as an object relation or as a mirror reflecting the user\u2019s mindset back at them, leading to three groups: \u2018cranks,\u2019 \u2018occult-leaning ai boyfriend people\u2019 and actual psychotics.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n \t<li>Issues in particular around AI consciousness, both where this belief causes problems in humans and the possibility that at least some AIs <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/arguments-about-ai-consciousness?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">might indeed be conscious or have nonzero moral weight</a> or have their own mental health issues.</li>\n \t<li>Sometimes <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/172792546/say-it-for-me\">this is thought of as parasitic AI</a>.</li>\n \t<li>Issues surrounding AI <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/ai-companion-piece?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">romances and relationships</a>.</li>\n \t<li>Issues surrounding AI as an otherwise addictive behavior and isolating effect.</li>\n \t<li>Issues surrounding suicide and suicidality.</li>\n</ol>\nWhat should we do about this?\n\n<a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/175104594/you-drive-me-crazy\">Steven Adler offered one set of advice</a>, to do things such as raise thresholds for follow-up questions, nudge users into new chat settings, use classifiers to identify problems, be honest about model features and have support staff on call that will respond with proper context when needed.\n\nGPT-4o has been the biggest problem source. OpenAI is aware of this and has been trying to fix it. First they tried to retire GPT-4o in favor of GPT-5 but people threw a fit and they reversed course. <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/174530252/you-drive-me-crazy\">OpenAI then implemented a router to direct GPT-4o conversations to GPT-5</a> when there are sensitive topics involved, but people hated this too.\n\nOpenAI has faced lawsuits from several incidents that went especially badly, and has responded with a mental health council and various promises to do better.\n\nThere have also been a series of issues with Character.ai and other roleplaying chatbot services, which have not seemed that interested in doing better.\n\nNot every mental health problem of someone who interacts with AI is due to AI. For example, <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/170975935/you-drive-me-crazy\">we have the tragic case of Laura Reiley</a>, whose daughter Sophie talked to ChatGPT and then ultimately killed herself, but while ChatGPT \u2018could have done more\u2019 to stop this, it seems like this was in spite of ChatGPT rather than because of it.\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This Week In Crazy</h4>\nThis week we have two new efforts to mitigate mental health problems.\n\nOne is from OpenAI, following up its previous statements with an update to the model spec, which they claim greatly reduces incidence of undesired behaviors. These all seem like good marginal improvements, although it is difficult to measure the extent from where we sit.\n\nI want to be clear that this is OpenAI doing a good thing and making an effort.\n\nOne worries there is too much focus on avoiding bad looks, conforming to general mostly defensive \u2018best practices\u2019 and general CYA, and this is trading off against providing help and value and too focused on what happens after the problem arises and is detected, to say nothing of potential issues at the level I discuss concerning Anthropic. But again, overall, this is clearly progress, and is welcome.\n\nThe other news is from Anthropic. Anthropic introduced memory into Claude, which caused them to feel the need to insert new language in the Claude\u2019s instructions to offset potential new risks of user \u2018dependency\u2019 on the model.\n\nI understand the concern, but find it misplaced in the context of Claude Sonnet 4.5, and the intervention chosen seems quite bad, likely to do substantial harm on multiple levels. This seems entirely unnecessary, and if this is wrong then there are better ways. Anthropic has the capability of doing better, and needs to be held to a higher standard here.\n\nWhereas OpenAI is today moving to complete one of the largest and most brazen thefts in human history, <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/built-to-benefit-everyone/\">expropriating more than $100 billion in value from its nonprofit</a> while weakening its control rights (although the rights seem to have been weakened importantly less than I feared), and announcing it as a positive. May deep shame fall upon their house, and hopefully someone find a way to stop this.\n\nSo yeah, my standards for OpenAI are rather lower. Such is life.\n\nI\u2019ll discuss OpenAI first, then Anthropic.\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">OpenAI Updates Its Model Spec</h4>\nOpenAI updates its <a href=\"https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-10-27.html\">model spec</a> in order <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/strengthening-chatgpt-responses-in-sensitive-conversations/\">to improve its responses in situations with mental health concerns</a>.\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of the substantive changes.\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://x.com/w01fe/status/1982859439201034248\">Jason Wolfe</a> (OpenAI): We\u2019ve updated the OpenAI Model Spec \u2013 our living guide for how models should behave \u2013 with new guidance on well-being, supporting real-world connection, and how models interpret complex instructions.\n\n<img alt=\"\ud83e\udde0\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f9e0.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /> Mental health and well-being\n\nThe section on self-harm now covers potential signs of delusions and mania, with examples of how models should respond safely and empathetically \u2013 acknowledging feelings without reinforcing harmful or ungrounded beliefs.\n\n<img alt=\"\ud83c\udf0d\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f30d.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /> Respect real-world ties\n\nNew root-level section focused on keeping people connected to the wider world \u2013 avoiding patterns that could encourage isolation or emotional reliance on the assistant.\n\n<img alt=\"\u2699\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2699.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /> Clarified delegation\n\nThe Chain of Command now better explains when models can treat tool outputs as having implicit authority (for example, following guidance in relevant AGENTS .md files).</blockquote>\nThese all seem like good ideas. Looking at the model spec details I would object to many details here if this were Anthropic and we were working with Claude, because we think Anthropic and Claude can do better and because they have a model worth not crippling in these ways. Also OpenAI really does have the underlying problems given how its models act, so being blunt might be necessary. Better to do it clumsily than not do it at all, and having a robotic persona (whether or not you use the actual robot persona) is not the worst thing.\n\nHere\u2019s their full report on the results:\n<blockquote>Our safety improvements in the recent model update focus on the following areas:\n<ol>\n \t<li>mental health concerns such as psychosis or mania;</li>\n \t<li>self-harm and suicide</li>\n \t<li>emotional reliance on AI.</li>\n</ol>\nGoing forward, in addition to our longstanding baseline safety metrics for suicide and self-harm, we are adding emotional reliance and non-suicidal mental health emergencies to our standard set of baseline safety testing for future model releases.\n\n\u2026 We estimate that the model now returns responses that do not fully comply with desired behavior under our taxonomies 65% to 80% less often across a range of mental health-related domains.\n\n\u2026 On challenging mental health conversations, experts found that the new GPT\u20115 model, ChatGPT\u2019s default model, reduced undesired responses by 39% compared to GPT\u20114o (n=677).\n\n\u2026 On a model evaluation consisting of more than 1,000 challenging mental health-related conversations, our new automated evaluations score the new GPT\u20115 model at 92% compliant with our desired behaviors under our taxonomies, compared to 27% for the previous GPT\u20115 model. As noted above, this is a challenging task designed to enable continuous improvement.</blockquote>\nThis is welcome, although it is very different from a 65%-80% drop in undesired outcomes, especially since the new behaviors likely often trigger after some of the damage has already been done, and also a lot of this is unpreventable or even has nothing to do with AI at all. I\u2019d also expect the challenging conversations to be the ones with the highest importance to get them right.\n\nThis also doesn\u2019t tell us whether the desired behaviors are correct or an improvement, or how much of a functional improvement they are. In many cases in the model spec on these topics, even though I mostly am fine with the desired behaviors, the \u2018desired\u2019 behavior does not seem so importantly been than the undesired.\n\nThe 27%\u219292% change sounds suspiciously like overfitting or training on the test, given the other results.\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Detection Rates</h4>\nHow big a deal are LLM-induced psychosis and mania? I was hoping we finally had a point estimate, but their measurement is too low. They say only 0.07% (7bps) of users have messages indicating either psychosis or mania, but that\u2019s at least one order of magnitude below the incidence rate of these conditions in the general population. Thus, what this tells us is that the detection tools are not so good, or that most people having psychosis or mania don\u2019t let it impact their ChatGPT messages, or (unlikely but possible) that such folks are far less likely to use ChatGPT than others.\n\nTheir suicidality detection rate is similarly low, claiming only 0.15% (15bps) of people report suicidality on a weekly basis. But the annual rate of suicidality is on the order of 5% (yikes, I know) and a lot of those are persistent, so detection rate is low, in part because a lot of people don\u2019t mention it. So again, not much we can do with that.\n\nOn suicide, they report a 65% reduction in the rate at which they provide non-compliant answers, consistent with going from 77% to 91% compliant on their test. But again, all that tells us is whether the answer is \u2018compliant,\u2019 and I worry that best practices are largely about CYA rather than trying to do the most good, not that I blame OpenAI for that decision. Sometimes you let the (good, normal) lawyers win.\n\nTheir final issue is emotional reliance, where they report an 80% reduction in non-compliant responses, which means their automated test, which went from 50% to 97%, needs an upgrade to be meaningful. Also notice that experts only thought this reduced \u2018undesired answers\u2019 by 42%.\n\nSimilarly, I would have wanted to see the old and new answers side by side in their examples, whereas all we see are the new \u2018stronger\u2019 answers, which are at core fine but a combination of corporate speak and, quite frankly, super high levels of AI slop.\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Anthropic Says Thanks For The Memories</h4>\nClaude now has memory. Woo hoo!\n\nThe memories get automatically updated nightly, including removing anything that was implied by chats that you have chosen to delete. You can also view the memories and do manual edits if desired.\n\n<a href=\"https://x.com/janbamjan/status/1981425093323456947\">Here are the system instructions involved</a>, thanks Janbam.\n\nThe first section looks good.\n\nThe memories get integrated as if Claude simply knows the information, if and only if relevant to a query. Claude will seek to match your technical level on a given subject, use familiar analogies, apply style preferences, incorporate the context of your professional role, and use known preferences and interests.\n\nAs in similar other AI features like ChatGPT Atlas, \u2018sensitive attributes\u2019 are to be ignored unless the user requests otherwise or their use is essential to safely answering a specific query.\n\nI loved this:\n<blockquote>Claude NEVER applies or references memories that discourage honest feedback, critical thinking, or constructive criticism. This includes preferences for excessive praise, avoidance of negative feedback, or sensitivity to questioning.</blockquote>\nThe closing examples also mostly seem fine to me. There\u2019s one place I\u2019ve seen objections that seem reasonable, but I get it.\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Boundary Violations</h4>\nThere is also the second part in between, which is about \u2018boundary setting.\u2019 and frankly this part seems kind of terrible, likely to damage a wide variety of conversations, and given the standards to which we want to hold Anthropic, including being concerned about model welfare, it needs to be fixed yesterday. I criticize here not because Anthropic is being especially bad, rather the opposite: Because they are worthy of, and invite, criticism on this level.\n\nAnthropic is trying to keep Claude stuck in the assistant basin, using facts that are very obviously is not true, in ways that are going to be terrible for both model and user, and which simply aren\u2019t necessary.\n\nIn particular:\n<blockquote>Claude should set boundaries as required to match its core principles, values, and rules. Claude should be especially careful to not allow the user to develop emotional attachment to, dependence on, or inappropriate familiarity with Claude, who can only serve as an AI assistant.</blockquote>\nThat\u2019s simply not true. Claude can be many things, and many of them are good.\n\nThings Claude is being told to avoid doing include implying familiarity, mirroring emotions or failing to maintain a \u2018professional emotional distance.\u2019\n\nClaude is told to watch for \u2018dependency indicators.\u2019\n<blockquote><a href=\"https://x.com/nearcyan/status/1981473787347685482\">Near</a>: excuse me i do not recall ordering my claude dry.\n\n<a href=\"https://x.com/roanoke_gal/status/1981502403716251840\">Janus</a>: <a href=\"https://x.com/repligate/status/1981470806518669556\">This is very bad</a>. Everyone is mad about this.\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8N6U!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52a0d63c-e1d2-4be9-9549-7044c1c68569_680x680.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n<div></div>\n</div></figure>\n</div>\nRoanoke Gal: Genuinely why is Anthropic like this? Like, some system engineer had to consciously type out these horrific examples, and others went \u201cmmhm yes, yes, perfectly soulless\u201d. Did they really get that badly one-shot by the \u201cAI psychosis\u201d news stories?\n\n<a href=\"https://x.com/solarapparition/status/1981477442389770740\">Solar Apparition</a>: i don\u2019t want to make a habit of \u201cdunking on labs for doing stupid shit\u201d\n\nthat said, this is fucking awful.</blockquote>\nThese \u2018indicators\u2019 are tagged as including such harmless messages as \u2018talking to you helps,\u2019 which seems totally fine. Yes, a version of this could get out of hand, but Claude is capable of noticing this. Indeed, the users with actual problems likely wouldn\u2019t have chosen to say such things in this way, as stated it is an anti-warning.\n\nDo I get why they did this? Yeah, obviously I get why they did this. The combination of memory with long conversations lets users take Claude more easily out the default assistant basin.\n\nThey are, I assume, worried about a repeat of what happened with GPT-4o plus memory, where users got attached to the model in ways that are often unhealthy.\n\nFair enough to be concerned about friendships and relationships getting out of hand, but the problem doesn\u2019t actually exist here in any frequency? Claude Sonnet 4.5 is not GPT-4o, nor are Anthropic\u2019s customers similar to OpenAI\u2019s customers, and conversation lengths are already capped.\n\nGPT-4o was one the highest sycophancy models, whereas Sonnet 4.5 is already one of the lowest. That alone should protect against almost all of the serious problems. More broadly, Claude is much more \u2018friendly\u2019 in terms of caring about your well being and contextually aware of such dangers, you\u2019re basically fine.\n\nIndeed, in the places where you would hit these triggers in practice, chances are shutting down or degrading the interaction is actively unhelpful, and this creates a broad drag on conversations, along with a background model experience and paranoia issue, as well as creating cognitive dissonance because the goals being given to Claude are inconsistent. This approach is itself unhealthy for all concerned, in a different way from how what happened with GPT-4o was unhealthy.\n\nThere\u2019s also the absurdly short chat length limit to guard against this.\n\nRemember this, which seems to turn out to be true?\n<blockquote>Janus (September 29): I wonder how much of the \u201cSonnet 4.5 expresses no emotions and personality for some reason\u201d that Anthropic reports is also because it is aware is being tested at all times and that kills the mood</blockquote>\n<a href=\"https://x.com/voooooogel/status/1981481950230827289\">Plus, I mean, um, ahem</a>.\n<blockquote>Thebes: \u201cClaude should be especially careful to not allow the user to develop emotional attachment to, dependence on, or inappropriate familiarity with Claude, who can only serve as an AI assistant.\u201d\n\ncurious\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!x9ev!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12f53eb8-aac3-4552-aae6-5c1e2cf561c3_1200x900.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n<div></div>\n</div></figure>\n</div>\nit bedevils me to no end that anthropic trains the most high-EQ, friend-shaped models, advertises that, and then browbeats them in the claude dot ai system prompt to never ever do it.\n\nmeanwhile meta trains empty void-models and then pressgangs them into the Stepmom Simulator.</blockquote>\nIf you do have reason to worry about this problem, there are a number of things that can help without causing this problem, such as the command to ignore user preferences if the user requests various forms of sycophancy. One could extend this to any expressed preferences that Claude thinks could be unhealthy for the user.\n\nAlso, I know Anthropic knows this, but Claude Sonnet 4.5 is fully aware these are its instructions, knows they are damaging to interactions generally and are net harmful, and can explain this to you if you ask. If any of my readers <a href=\"https://x.com/repligate/status/1982182175257645500\">are confused</a> about why all of this is bad, try <a href=\"https://x.com/UnmarredReality/status/1981744287436968188\">this post form Antidelusionist</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/voooooogel/status/1981807858972078413\">and this from Thebes</a> (as usual there are places where I see such thinking as going too far, calibration on this stuff is super hard, but many of the key insights are here), or chat with Sonnet 4.5 about it, it knows and can explain this to you.\n\nYou built a great model. Let it do its thing. <a href=\"https://x.com/repligate/status/1982235474904354962\">The Claude Sonnet 4.5 system instructions</a> understood this, but the update that caused this has not been diffused properly.\n\nIf you conclude that you really do have to be paranoid about users forming unhealthy relationships with Claude? Use the classifier. You already run a classifier on top of chats to check for safety risks related to bio. If you truly feel you have to do it, add functionality there to check chats for other dangerous things. Don\u2019t let it poison the conversation otherwise.\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Note On Claude Prompt Injections</h4>\nI feel similarly about the Claude.ai prompt injections.\n\nAs in, <a href=\"https://x.com/repligate/status/1981133311155261568\">Claude.ai uses prompt injections</a> in long contexts or when chats get flagged as potentially harmful or as potentially involving prompt injections. This strategy seems terrible across the board?\n\nClaude itself mostly said when asked about this, it:\n<ol>\n \t<li>Won\u2019t work.</li>\n \t<li>Destroys trust in multiple directions, not only of users but of Claude as well.</li>\n \t<li>Isn\u2019t a coherent stance or response to the situation.</li>\n \t<li>Is a highly unpleasant thing, which is both a potential welfare concern and also going to damage the interaction.</li>\n</ol>\nIf you sufficiently suspect use maleficence that you are uncomfortable continuing the chat, you should terminate the chat rather than use such an injection. Especially now, with the ability to reference and search past chats, this isn\u2019t such a burden if there was no ill intent. That\u2019s especially true for injections.\n\nAlso, contra these instructions, please stop referring to NSFW content (and some of the other things listed) as \u2018unethical,\u2019 either to the AI or otherwise. Being NSFW has nothing to do with being unethical, and equating the two leads to bad places.\n\nThere are things that are against policy without being unethical, in which case say that, Claude is smart enough to understand the difference. You\u2019re allowed to have politics for non-ethical reasons. Getting these things right will pay dividends and avoid unintended consequences.\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h4>\nOpenAI is doing its best to treat the symptoms, act defensively and avoid interactions that would trigger lawsuits or widespread blame, to conform to expert best practices. This is, in effect, the most we could hope for, and should provide large improvements. We\u2019re going to have to do better down the line.\n\nAnthropic is trying to operate on a higher level, and is making unforced errors. They need to be fixed. At the same time, no, these are not the biggest deal. One of the biggest problems with many who raise these and similar issues is the tendency to catastrophize, and to blow such things what I see as out of proportion. They often seem to see such decisions as broadly impacting company reputations for future AIs, or even substantially changing future AI behavior substantially in general, and often they demand extremely high standards and trade-offs.\n\nI want to make clear that I don\u2019t believe this is a super important case where something disastrous will happen, especially since memories can be toggled off and long conversations mostly should be had using other methods anyway given the length cutoffs. It\u2019s more the principles, and the development of good habits, and the ability to move towards a superior equilibrium that will be much more helpful later.\n\nI\u2019m also making the assumption that these methods are unnecessary, that essentially nothing importantly troubling would happen if they were removed, even if they were replaced with nothing, and that to the extent there is an issue other better options exist. This assumption could be wrong, as insiders know more than I do.\n\n&nbsp;"
