                "<p><em>Hi! It&#8217;s me, <a href=\"https://x.com/can\">Can</a> again. Today, we need to talk about the $4 billion elephant in the secure room: SOC2.</em></p><div><hr /></div><p>Working at a small tech company has perks. You want to fix a bug? Push a change to production. A user has problems? Connect to the database and look up, and hopefully fix up, their data.</p><p>Large firms work differently. When you are a large enterprise, you promise your customers that the product won't change under them or that their data won't be snooped on. It&#8217;s why they have large customers, and large sums of money.</p><p>So what do you do as a small company when you want to sell your product to a large company? How do you bridge that trust gap? Well, these days, you check your bank balance and then call up Vanta to ask about SOC2.</p><p>In related <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/23/crowdstrike-backed-vanta-is-valued-at-4-billion-in-new-funding-round.html\">news</a>, Vanta just raised a bunch of money:</p><blockquote><p>Vanta, a startup with software for managing compliance with cybersecurity and privacy standards, said Wednesday that it closed its latest fundraising round at a roughly $4 billion valuation.</p><p>The $150 million round, which included funding from <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CRWD/\">CrowdStrike&#8217;s</a> venture arm, represents a valuation increase from $2.45 billion last year.</p></blockquote><h2>What is SOC2, anyway?</h2><p>SOC 2 is essentially a way to tell people that you have undergone certain security checks. You hire an auditor, who gives you a huge spreadsheet and tells you to start acting like an adult. You start doing criminal background checks on employees, write up all sorts of policies (all the way from password rotation policies to what happens if your CTO gets stranded in a remote island), tighten up the security of your data, code, and a bunch of other stuff. It&#8217;s a lot, and feels like it won&#8217;t ever end. You put all that into the spreadsheet over the course of weeks, or even months.</p><p>If the auditors like what you've put into the spreadsheet, you get a Type 1 certificate, which is more of an IOU. What you really want is the Type 2 certificate, which requires a 6 month wait. During this \"observation period\", the auditors continuously check if you've been following your own procedures. Then, if they are convinced, you get the Type 2 certificate as a fancy PDF. You put the SOC2 logo on your website, write a blog post, tell all your prospects you are now a secure company. And, of course, the observation period starts again. The cycle continues.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kfnr!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F973ec680-121b-4aa8-abef-f00386166e25_2086x1392.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"972\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kfnr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F973ec680-121b-4aa8-abef-f00386166e25_2086x1392.png\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">OK, this is a funny billboard.</figcaption></figure></div><p>So, where does Vanta fit in all this? They make and fill in the spreadsheet for you.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.readmargins.com/feed#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> As \"the compliance automation platform\", they sit between your company, \"the service organization\" and the auditors. Auditors look at the spreadsheet created by Vanta and give you a pass/fail score.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.readmargins.com/feed#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a></p><p>The \"tech\" angle behind all this is connecting to all your systems like AWS and Github and verifying things are locked down. Vanta also syncs up with your HR systems like Google or Workday to make sure people follow their training schedule, accept their policies, and pass their criminal checks. It's a big value add for Type 1, and a true life-saver for Type 2.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.readmargins.com/feed#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a></p><p>Now, in a pure business sense, Vanta should be good for the world. If they are lubricating the wheels of commerce by making sure even small companies can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MSYAndGwMg\">cross the enterprise chasm</a>, it's fair for them to get a cut of the marginal transactions they are enabling. After all, that&#8217;s why most SaaS companies exist. We all make the world a better place, in our small ways.  </p><p>There's, however, a cynical view that SOC2 (and other compliances) is essentially now a tax that you have to pay. You do it not because you have to, or because it makes your product more safe and secure, but because the industry undertow makes you do it. With a conservative 20x multiple, Vanta could be making $200M a year. What percent of that is the enterprise value their customers have created that they are capturing and what percent is just a tax? </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eoCk!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7e2dce9-8b89-45f6-b536-00581797c573_1168x358.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"358\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eoCk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7e2dce9-8b89-45f6-b536-00581797c573_1168x358.png\" width=\"1168\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Linear co-founder (via <a href=\"https://x.com/jorilallo/status/1752783996826665257\">x</a>) </figcaption></figure></div><h2>Problems with SOC2</h2><p>First, the perverse incentives and the pay for play. The auditors work for you, the client. It's in the auditors' interest to keep you happy, so it doesn't take a lot to convince them you are doing the right thing. The enterprise customers often don't even know who the auditors are before seeing the SOC2 report, because seeing the report requires an NDA. And these customers rarely, if ever, choose their vendors based on their auditors, if they ever read the report at all. Having read a few SOC2 reports for my company's vendors, I can tell you the quality of reports, and the security postures, vary wildly. And, needless to say, no one cares if the product is good but the report is bad.  </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vlr_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F000ec1d0-cf32-4aa7-9ab7-d73957506d6c_1448x344.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vlr_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F000ec1d0-cf32-4aa7-9ab7-d73957506d6c_1448x344.png\" width=\"1448\" /><div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">That&#8217;s an excellent <a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/soc2-the-screenshots-will-continue-until-security-improves/\">title</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Second, the entire process is incredibly janky. A shocking amount of the SOC2 process is built on <a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/soc2-the-screenshots-will-continue-until-security-improves/\">screenshots</a>. If that sounds extremely insecure, you are correct. You take screenshots of your tools. You take screenshots of your JIRA tickets. Whatever you need to &#8220;prove,&#8221; you take a screenshot, and upload it to Vanta as evidence. The word \"evidence\" belies a forensic approach, but it's a lot more TSA checkpoint than actual detective work. There&#8217;s no chain of custody, authentication, anything. The entire system largely hinges on your auditor&#8217;s trust in your screenshots.</p><p>Third, the network effects. The entire thing spreads <a href=\"https://x.com/alon/status/1752823377323327899\">like a virus</a> in the system, in two ways. First, it's via the technical dependencies embedded in the SOC2 process. Even the smallest of SaaS companies run on other SaaS companies' products<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.readmargins.com/feed#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a>. In order to get your auditors' approval for SOC2, you end up having to validate all your vendors' security practices. You can already see where this is going. That, of course, also requires you to get their SOC2 certificate. Turtles all the way down!</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!60yq!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50b2bfd3-ac9c-4276-8566-abed557c7672_401x238.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"238\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!60yq!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50b2bfd3-ac9c-4276-8566-abed557c7672_401x238.png\" width=\"401\" /><div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">via <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/641/\">xkcd</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>And then, more subtly, there's the social pressure. Sure, SOC2 makes your company more secure. But ultimate security is an elusive, platonic ideal. No company with SOC2 is immune to a rogue employee or a dedicated hacker. Things always slip through the cracks.</p><p>However, with everyone around you getting SOC2, your investors being investors in various players in the ecosystem like Vanta, the FOMO to \"just get SOC2 and be done with it\" is immense and hard to argue against. Not only that, it comes earlier and earlier in companies' lifecycles now. Companies without product-market fit or even a sales team spend weeks on SOC2. Is that the best use of anyone's time or are we just watching a very elaborate Kabuki theater?</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t0rd!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb68a3250-61b9-4590-90a8-c36538b66d29_1200x857.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"857\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t0rd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb68a3250-61b9-4590-90a8-c36538b66d29_1200x857.jpeg\" title=\"\" width=\"1200\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">SOC2 is serious business</figcaption></figure></div><h2>It&#8217;s Just Business</h2><p>Look, this is not to say that Vanta is a bad actor. It&#8217;s a hugely successful business. And clearly, <a href=\"https://x.com/tferriss/status/1885831142718275698\">many people</a> love it. I know lots of great people who work there. And I keep mentioning them as a placeholder for this industry because they are the leaders. </p><p>Making it easy to get SOC2 earlier in a company's lifecycle is a <a href=\"https://x.com/christinacaci/status/1948424965285666921\">great idea</a>. A company that has a security mindset earlier on is going to be a Fort Knox compared to a large company that bolts on a bunch of policies later on. It'll also be more pleasant for everyone, and cheaper. These are undeniably good things. Any time technology makes something hard easier, I err on the side of celebrating that.</p><p>Not only that, I know people who have <em>had to</em> get their SOC2 before Vanta and those people would have killed to have the automations and integration tools that Vanta provides. It's a clear value-add for those who <a href=\"https://x.com/ejzim/status/1948440664804655608\">need</a> it. It&#8217;s a lot more fun to click buttons than to fill in those spreadsheets. </p><p>Yet, in this case, I am not convinced the tech industry has become better thanks to our newfound love for SOC2. Vanta is not a villain, but they aren't heroes either. Currently, they are the enablers of a flawed system, not unlike TurboTax and the IRS. </p><p>Ask yourselves. Are we all more efficient at sales and go-to market now that we are all SOC2 certified? Are everyone's products safer as a whole? As a customer, have you ever checked if an app you are using is SOC2 certified. As a professional, did seeing SOC2 on your vendors&#8217; security page give you more confidence or did you just feel good about CYA? </p><p>What many won't tell you is that the real secret to SOC2 is less about using the right platform and more about finding an agreeable auditor. Like I alluded to before, most SOC2 reports aren't read. If a company wants to use a vendor, and their vendor's report is awful, it won't stop them. But everyone's stuck doing the right thing, even when it's the wrong thing.</p><h2>Breaking the Screenshot Tax</h2><p>The irony is thick. Small companies used to sell the dream of being a cowboy: pushing to production, fixing problems directly, moving fast. Then we built tools to help small companies act like big companies so they could sell to big companies. Now those same small companies spend their precious early days filling out compliance spreadsheets instead of finding product-market fit. Where did the fun go?</p><p>It is now time to replace SOC2 with something better<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.readmargins.com/feed#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a>; something continuous, programmatic, and discrete. A compliance scheme that monitors security in real-time, just like we monitor our apps. One that updates automatically when you fix a vulnerability, not six months later when the auditors check back in. The good thing is Vanta now has both quite a bit of leverage and expertise on both sides of this market. They have the integrations, the customer base, and now $150 million in fresh capital. They should use <a href=\"https://x.com/christinacaci/status/1948439197897163077\">their powers</a> (and new coffers) for good. Enterprises won't like giving up their familiar PDFs, but someone has to drag them into the 21st century. </p><p>The same ingenuity that created this compliance-industrial complex can tear it down. We've already transformed how we build and deliver software&#8212;from waterfall to agile, from shrink-wrap to SaaS, from annual releases to continuous deployment. We monitor our systems in real-time instead of waiting for post-mortems. We scan for vulnerabilities continuously instead of scheduling yearly pen tests. Hell, we even moved from PDF manuals to living documentation.</p><p>So why are we still treating compliance like it's 1995? Imagine getting dinged for a security issue you fixed three months ago, just because the auditors haven't caught up. Or passing your SOC2 while harboring vulnerabilities that appeared yesterday. It's time to ship the future of trust, not just automate the past. All that's missing is our collective will to stop paying the tax so I can go back to pushing code to prod.</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Thanks for reading Margins by Ranjan Roy and Can Duruk!

                "<p><em>[see footnote 4 for conflicts of interest]</em></p><p>In 2021, <strong><a href=\"https://www.lifeview.com/\">Genomic Prediction</a></strong> announced <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/welcome-polygenically-screened-babies\">the first polygenically selected baby</a>.</p><p>When a couple uses IVF, they may get as many as ten embryos. If they only want one child, which one do they implant? In the early days, doctors would just eyeball them and choose whichever looked healthiest. Later, they started testing for some of the most severe and easiest-to-detect genetic disorders like Down Syndrome and cystic fibrosis<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a>. The final step was polygenic selection - genotyping each embryo and implanting the one with the best genes overall. </p><p>Best in what sense? Genomic Prediction claimed the ability to forecast health outcomes from diabetes to schizophrenia. For example, although the average person has a 30% chance of getting type II diabetes, if you genetically test five embryos and select the one with the lowest predicted risk, they&#8217;ll only have a 20% chance<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a>. Since you&#8217;re taking the healthiest of many embryos, you should expect a child conceived via this method to be significantly healthier than one born naturally. Polygenic selection straddles the line between disease prevention and human enhancement.</p><p>In 2023, <strong><a href=\"https://www.orchidhealth.com/\">Orchid Health</a></strong> entered the field. Unlike Genomic Prediction, which tested only the most important genetic variants, Orchid offers <em>whole genome sequencing</em>, which can detect the <em>de novo</em><a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a> mutations involved in autism, developmental disorders, and certain other genetic diseases.</p><p>Critics accused GP and Orchid of offering &#8220;designer babies&#8221;, but this was only true in the weakest sense - customers couldn&#8217;t &#8220;design&#8221; a baby for anything other than slightly lower risk of genetic disease. These companies refused to offer selection on &#8220;traits&#8221; - the industry term for the really controversial stuff like height, IQ, or eye color. Still, these were trivial extensions of their technology, and everybody knew it was just a matter of time before someone took the plunge.</p><p>Last month, a startup called <strong><a href=\"https://mynucleus.com/\">Nucleus</a></strong><a href=\"https://mynucleus.com/\"> </a>took the plunge. They had previously offered 23andMe style genetic tests for adults. Now they announced a partnership with Genomic Prediction focusing on embryos. Although GP would continue to only test for health outcomes, you could forward the raw data from GP to Nucleus, and Nucleus would predict extra traits, including height, BMI, eye color, hair color, ADHD, IQ, and even handedness.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AhRe!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fe46636-0881-4fc1-bdff-6857df00acbe_817x585.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"486.187270501836\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AhRe!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fe46636-0881-4fc1-bdff-6857df00acbe_817x585.png\" width=\"679\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Sample Nucleus results.</figcaption></figure></div><p>And this week, <strong><a href=\"https://www.herasight.com/\">Herasight</a></strong><a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a> entered the space with the most impressive disease risk scores yet, an IQ predictor worth 6-9<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a> extra points, and a series of challenges to competitors, whom they call out for insufficient scientific rigor. Their most scathing attack is on Nucleus itself, accusing its predictions of being misleading and unreliable.</p><p>Let&#8217;s start with the science, then move on to the companies and see if we can litigate their dispute.</p><h2>In Theory, All Of This Should Work</h2><p>Polygenic embryo screening is a natural extension of two well-validated technologies: genetic testing of embryos, and polygenic prediction of traits in adults.</p><p>Genetic testing of embryos has been done for decades, usually to detect chromosomal abnormalities like Down Syndrome or simple single-gene disorders like cystic fibrosis. It&#8217;s challenging - you need to take a very small number of cells (often only 5-10) from a tiny proto-placenta that may not have many cells to spare, and extract a readable amount of genetic material from this limited sample - but there are known solutions that mostly work.</p><p>But most traits are polygenic, requiring information about thousands or tens of thousands of genes to predict. These are too complicated to understand fully at current levels of technology, but some studies have chipped away at the problem and gotten a partial understanding. Often this looks like being able to predict a few percent of the variance in a trait, and determine whether someone&#8217;s genetic risk is slightly higher or lower than average.</p><p>Polygenic prediction of traits in adults is still young and full of hidden pitfalls. Last month, we discussed how some early studies unknowingly conflated direct genetic effects and various confounders<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" target=\"_self\">6</a> - for example, they tended to pick up on genes associated with well-off ethnic groups or families who had good health outcomes for social reasons. Pinpointing the direct component requires an additional step where researchers validate their algorithms within families (for example, on pairs of siblings where one has a higher polygenic score than the other) to see how much predictive power remains. This is especially important for embryo selection companies, whose entire value proposition depends on comparing two genomes from the same family. </p><p>How have they done? It depends on the number of embryos they have to work with; the more embryos, the better you can do by selecting the best.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VOdq!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ba32f3-72fa-4be1-846c-6b0b04a5a213_774x279.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"243.3139534883721\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VOdq!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1ba32f3-72fa-4be1-846c-6b0b04a5a213_774x279.png\" width=\"675\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Herasight&#8217;s numbers on how breast cancer risk goes down with number of embryos used in selection.

That implies that not getting Type 2 diabetes is worth $27,000. Ask anybody dealing with regular insulin injections (let alone limb amputations) whether it would be worth $27,000 to wave a magic wand and not have Type 2 diabetes! It&#8217;s not a hard question! And that&#8217;s just one of a dozen conditions you can lower the risk for! Other ones, like not getting breast cancer, might be so valuable that it&#8217;s hard to even attach numbers!</p><p>(but maybe the low time discount rate is a mistake? Suppose you invest the $3,250 in an index fund that makes 7% over inflation, then give it to your future child when they turn 45 (average age of type 2 diabetes diagnoses). Now it&#8217;s worth $75,000. Is this the &#8220;true&#8221; cost of the intervention? Does it matter that this counterfactual is fake and most people don&#8217;t do this?)</p><p>What about IQ? Six extra IQ points (Herasight&#8217;s estimate with five embryos) is about a quarter of the gap between the average person and the average Ivy League student. The benefits of intelligence are hard to quantify, but it&#8217;s been shown to have probably-causal positive effects on <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289607000219\">income</a>, <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2017/06/28/high-iq-children-longevity-study/\">mortality</a>, and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23531483/\">achievement</a>. Probably the income effects alone make up for the cost of intervention - again assuming total parent-child altruism and low discount rate<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-8\" id=\"footnote-anchor-8\" target=\"_self\">8</a>. </p><p>So if we accept all of these claims and assumptions, the choice seems obvious. It&#8217;s probably even obvious for <em>governments</em> to pay for <em>all citizens</em> to get these, given how much they&#8217;d save on health care costs.</p><h2>In Practice, It&#8217;s Complicated</h2><p>Critics have raised both scientific and ethical objections to polygenic embryo screening.</p><p>Polygenic embryo selection has been condemned by various bodies including the <a href=\"https://ispg.net/ethics-statement/\">Society For Psychiatric Genetics</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-021-01000-x\">European Society of Human Genetics</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.bga.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&amp;club_id=971921&amp;module_id=734874\">Behavioral Genetics Society</a>. Their statements are . . . not good. They tend towards vague language about how people are more than just their genes, or how no genetic test can be perfect, or how embryo screening is not exactly the same thing as some other form of screening which has a longer history and more proponents. &#8220;Although in general higher scores mean you are more likely to have a condition, many healthy people will have high scores; others might develop the condition even with a low score&#8221;, says the Society for Psychiatric Genetics, as if they have just blown the lid off some dastardly conspiracy. &#8220;Screening embryos for psychiatric conditions may increase stigma surrounding these diagnoses&#8221;, they continue - an objection which, taken seriously, could be used to ban every form of medical treatment. We will mostly ignore these people and try to imagine the objections that mildly competent critics might raise, some of which will coincidentally overlap with the content of the non-hypothetical statements.</p><p><strong>Scientific Objection: Efficacy</strong></p><p>Are we sure this works at all?</p><p>A typical polygenic score is created by collecting thousands or millions of adult genomes, then matching genetic information with surveys about who has the trait/condition of interest. Reputable studies then test these scores on holdout samples - adults who were not used to make the score - to see if they still accurately predict who has the trait/condition. Polygenic embryo selection depends on an assumption that the scores which work in these kinds of retrospective tests will also work prospectively on embryos. This assumption hasn&#8217;t been formally proven in studies (which would require years to decades to conduct), but seems common-sensical.</p><p>The strongest challenge to the application of polygenic scores for embryo selection comes from a recent body of research showing that most scores combine causal genetic effects with population stratification, and therefore can be expected to lose much of their predictive power when comparing two members of the same family (e.g. two embryos from the same couple). There is increasing agreement in the field that unless scores are validated within families, headline results like &#8220;decreases risk of X by Y%&#8221; will be large overestimates. </p><p>When I talked to company representatives, they all said that they took accuracy extremely seriously and had various white papers and journal articles where anyone could double-check their methodology. But I attended an industry conference a few months ago, and the gossip level was comparable to a high school cafeteria (minus the sex rumors - most of the attendees were having their own kids via IVF). Everyone had some story about someone being careless or fudging their numbers.</p><p>Some of the conflicts broke out into the open on Wednesday, when Herasight left stealth and published a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EpFi160I1t11RWYFe1_uJZ0ixP4WL-Na/view\">white paper</a> and associated <a href=\"https://herasight.substack.com/\">blog post</a>. They criticize Genomic Prediction for reporting between-family rather than within family results<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-9\" id=\"footnote-anchor-9\" target=\"_self\">9</a>, and Orchid for smuggling a term for age into their Alzheimer&#8217;s predictor (unsurprisingly, this makes it work better). We&#8217;ll get to their accusations against Nucleus below. Note that this was recent enough that competitors haven&#8217;t had time to respond or to air their own criticisms of Herasight; if this happens, I&#8217;ll try to keep you updated.</p><p>Maybe this is cope, but my optimistic perspective is that this bounds the damage. This obviously isn&#8217;t a field capable of maintaining a conspiracy of silence. But aside from the Nucleus allegations, the complaints aren&#8217;t existential. Maybe some numbers are too high, maybe some predictors are slightly rigged. But the more we learn about these admittedly concerning problems, the more we can hope that we&#8217;d have heard about it if nothing worked at all. </p><p>Overall my strongest opinion on the scientific criticisms is:</p><ol><li><p>Authorities on all sides have cited Alex Young<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-10\" id=\"footnote-anchor-10\" target=\"_self\">10</a> as an authority on how polygenic scores can be confounded or misleading.</p></li><li><p>Last week Alex Young <a href=\"https://x.com/AlexTISYoung/status/1950575617294180510\">revealed</a> that he had been working with Herasight while it was in stealth mode, and endorses their research.</p></li><li><p>LOL.</p></li><li><p>Probably that means Herasight&#8217;s products are okay.</p></li><li><p>That serves as proof-of-concept that this technology can work, and means other companies&#8217; claims are at least plausible.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Scientific Objections: Antagonistic Pleiotropy</strong></p><p>This is a fancy term for &#8220;sometimes genes that are good in one way are bad in other ways&#8221;. For example, there is a gene that decreases the risk of lung cancer, but increases the risk of leukemia. If you selected against lung cancer, you might give your child higher leukemia risk. Several of the professional societies raise this concern, and Sasha Gusev gives several examples <a href=\"https://theinfinitesimal.substack.com/p/science-fictions-are-outpacing-science\">here</a>, including a correlation between education/IQ and anorexia.</p><p>When I think about these concerns, I consider the following thought experiment: suppose that I had a natural, unselected child, and that child became high school valedictorian and got into Harvard. Would my first reaction be &#8220;Oh no! This slightly raises her risk of anorexia!&#8221;? If not, why should this be our reaction to artificially increasing IQ? Genetic selection isn&#8217;t doing some different, magical thing. It&#8217;s just picking from within the natural IQ/anorexia variation. If you would be happy to have higher IQ (or lower breast cancer risk, or lower schizophrenia risk) naturally, you should be happy to get it through selection too.</p><p>(Objection one: suppose that the genetic component of IQ is net negative, but the environmental component is net positive to an even greater degree. Then IQ itself might be net positive - so you could still celebrate your valedictorian child - but since the genetic component alone is bad you wouldn&#8217;t want to select for it. I have never heard anyone seriously claim this, most studies suggest that genetic components of good things are good in the expected ways, and most critics don&#8217;t get this far. I mention it for the sake of completeness only.)</p><p>(Objection two: is the example above just saying that I value IQ more than non-anorexia? If so, couldn&#8217;t I give an alternate example of learning that my child isn&#8217;t anorexic, celebrating this seemingly-obviously-good fact, but actually this means they have lower IQ and based on my stated values I should be sad? I don&#8217;t think so. There is no claim that the increased anorexia risk from raising IQ is exactly as bad as the IQ increase is good - for example, you could imagine a world where going from moron to supergenius only raises anorexia risk 0.0001%. More generally  - although not rigorously - selecting for X should usually increase X more than it increases tangentially-correlated construct Y. So selecting for IQ should be net positive, even though it might slightly increase anorexia risk, and selecting for anorexia should be net negative, even though it might slightly increase IQ. I think this is the intuition that drives parents to be happy both when they learn that their child is smart, <em>and</em> when they learn their child doesn&#8217;t have anorexia - not just an intuition that one trait matters more than the other)</p><p>But also, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01057-4\">here&#8217;s</a> the table of correlated genetic risks for psychiatric disorders:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!G_Lu!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7049550b-4253-4900-9fe1-9f2df009e829_446x432.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"432\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!G_Lu!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7049550b-4253-4900-9fe1-9f2df009e829_446x432.png\" width=\"446\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>&#8230;where blue means that lowering the risk of one disease also lowers the risk of the other, and red means the opposite (as in the IQ - anorexia example above).</p><p><a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.946608v1.full.pdf\">Here&#8217;s the same table for other conditions</a>, courtesy of Genomic Prediction (except I flipped the colors from the original, to match the one above):</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jscV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a3ad311-4745-4f16-b82a-7ccdb297c670_1239x1600.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"880.7102502017756\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jscV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a3ad311-4745-4f16-b82a-7ccdb297c670_1239x1600.png\" width=\"682\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Aside from two bright orange squares (gallstones vs. hypertension and hypothyroidism - I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s up with this and it doesn&#8217;t seem to be a widely-appreciated result) we see that most correlations are zero or positive - that is, selecting against one disease selects against another or at worst does nothing. In this ocean of blue, worrying about those few orange squares feels a bit motivated.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/book-review-from-oversight-to-overkill\">Hans Jonas-ism</a> says that no medical intervention may ever cause any harm, no matter how much benefit it produces. By this standard, perhaps slightly raising the risk of gallstones in the process of preventing various cancers and psychoses and other forms of human misery is unacceptable. To anyone with the more normal perspective where something with large benefits and tiny downsides is still pretty good, I don&#8217;t think the antagonistic pleiotropy argument carries much weight. </p><p><strong>Ethical Objection: Cost</strong></p><p>No way around this one: if these products work, they mean that rich people can have healthier/smarter/taller/prettier kids than poor people.</p><p>One might object that at least they&#8217;re in good company: other products which help rich kids get healthier/smarter/taller/prettier than poor kids include private tutors, gyms, hair salons, health insurance, clothing, books, and food. Is this really the time to declare ourselves against this kind of thing? But maybe we should fight against expanding this already-bloated category. Or maybe there&#8217;s something more final about a genetic advantage.</p><p>Maybe a stronger argument is that rich people get first crack at every new technology, but poor people usually follow close behind. The first cellphone, in 1982, cost $12,000 in today&#8217;s dollars. Now you can get something a thousand times better for $50, and Kenyan pastoralists use cell phones to call up the local shaman. The trajectory of genetics has been even more striking: sequencing a single genome cost about $100 million in 2000 and is <a href=\"https://frontlinegenomics.com/the-100-genome-wheres-the-limit/\">somewhere around $100 today.</a></p><p>Polygenic embryo selection has the potential to follow a similar path. There are two associated costs - sequencing the embryos, and running the analysis. Sequencing costs are decreasing and may eventually be comparable to the sorts of genetic screening (for e.g. Down Syndrome) that most families get anyway. Analysis costs are mostly the one-time expense of inventing the predictor; we might expect these to follow the same pattern as generic medications, where cutting-edge technology is jealously guarded and expensive, but last decade&#8217;s technology has made its way off patent and is cheap-to-free. A few groups have already created free open-source predictors; so far these are much worse than the private companies&#8217; versions, but one of last year&#8217;s ACX Grantees is working on a better one.</p><p>Also, it would be crazy for any forward-thinking government not to cover this; it could save hundreds of thousands of dollars in future health care expenses. In countries with public health care, this comes directly out of the government treasury; even in the US, it&#8217;s covered by Medicare after age 65. The government should be <em>begging</em> people to select embryos.</p><p>The most persistent cost barrier is likely to be <em>in vitro</em> fertilization itself, a necessary precursor. In the US, 2-3% of babies are born through IVF. For those kids, this is a no-brainer - even if the cost never comes down, the cheaper products are only a fraction of total IVF expense. What about the other 98%? If those parents feel like they have to get embryo selection (and therefore IVF) to keep up, this could be a significant burden. IVF isn&#8217;t fun - it requires pumping a woman full of mind-altering hormones for weeks, extracting eggs in a minor surgery, and then implanting embryos in another minor surgery, all with a decent chance that some step will fail and you&#8217;ll have to do it all again.

Lots of people (and the aforementioned professional organizations) manage anyway, but it&#8217;s hard.</p><p>If this were a single-use medical treatment, delivered by a doctor after someone got the relevant condition, it would be one of the biggest advances of the decade - imagine a drug that cures 10 - 40%<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-17\" id=\"footnote-anchor-17\" target=\"_self\">17</a> of breast cancers with no side effects! But in fact, it works for breast cancer, <em>and</em> schizophrenia, <em>and </em>heart attacks, <em>and </em>approximately everything else. The only things comparable are antibiotics and <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/why-does-ozempic-cure-all-diseases\">GLP-1RAs</a>. </p><p>And then there&#8217;s the IQ effects. Even after studying the literature, people have wildly different opinions about the importance of IQ. One of the most important debates is to what degree IQ differences are a cause of poverty, a consequence of poverty, or both. I lean towards both - a country with limited access to schools and medical care will have low average IQ, but as a consequence it probably won&#8217;t become the next big semiconductor hub. This technology could close half the IQ gap between poor and middle-income countries, or between middle-income and rich. Or it could give rich countries average IQs that have never been seen before, and let us see what kind of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-ring_theory_of_economic_development\">O-ring technologies</a> (and new forms of social cooperation) lie just beyond the frontier. </p><p>(this is the nice quantifiable argument in favor of IQ enhancement, but I find myself more convinced by fuzzier things - how much is it worth to be able to enjoy great art and literature? To fully comprehend what we know of nature, and be able to fully appreciate the mystery of the rest? To have a sense of why society works the way it does, instead of feeling like you&#8217;re being blown back and forth by institutions you don&#8217;t really understand? Amateur psychoanalysts like to say that the only people who care about IQ are those looking for an excuse to boast about how high their own is, but my experience is the opposite: I care about IQ because I bang up against the limits of my own a thousand times a day, and I hate it. I fantasize about ways to make my children smarter than I am for the same reason a dog confined in a tiny crate might fantasize about getting her puppies adopted out to a nice house with a big grassy yard.)</p><p>My biggest qualm is that it might not matter. This is such a tiny foothill, flanking such a vast and foreboding range of mountains, that it might be a mistake to care about it at all.</p><p>Selecting the best of five or ten embryos is not a very effective way to get the genes you want. There are <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DfrSZaf3JC8vJdbZL/how-to-make-superbabies\">things in the pipeline</a> that will make this look like Hippocrates draining black bile. By the time the first polygenically selected children are adults, they&#8217;ll be old news.</p><p>And then there&#8217;s AI. The average age at diagnosis for Type II diabetes is 45 years. Will there still be people growing gradually older and getting Type II diabetes and taking insulin injections in 2070? If not, what are we even doing here?</p><p>Many people in the transhumanist community are still bullish on this technology. They think - well, there&#8217;s still an outside chance that something comes up and AGI takes another few decades. If we can enhance humans to be smarter, healthier, and more determined by the time it arrives, maybe we&#8217;ll have a better chance. Or maybe, if there&#8217;s a positive optimistic vision of a human-based high-tech future, people will be more willing to delay AI in the first place.</p><p>I like this argument, but I also think it&#8217;s worth stepping back. What&#8217;s the point of anything? Why have kids at all in a world that&#8217;s changing this fast? Why save for the future? At some point your answer has to be romantic and aesthetic - it&#8217;s never been clear whether anything you do matters in any ultimate sense, but you&#8217;ve got to act as if it does and hope for the best.</p><p>From that perspective, this is the most romantic technology of all. You&#8217;re not just giving a better life to your kids. Genes travel from generation to generation; you&#8217;re giving a better life your grandkids, your great-grandkids and so on to the point 1.77*log&#8322;(population) generations from now when you are the ancestor of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identical_ancestors_point\">everybody </a>and <a href=\"https://carlzimmer.medium.com/seven-big-misconceptions-about-heredity-42c94ba80365\">nobody</a>. Somebody in Macaronesia in 3525 AD will avoid getting breast cancer because of you (if there is still cancer; if there are still breasts).</p><p>Some combination of reasonable cost-benefit analysis and romantic/aesthetic commitments makes me want to have children despite the uncertainty, and the same combination made me sign up to use this technology despite the same.

Genomic Prediction&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.lifeview.com/risk-reduction-calculator\">their risk calculator </a>calculator shows, seemingly paradoxically, that you get -38% relative risk by selecting against diabetes alone, but -41% relative risk by selecting against <a href=\"https://www.lifeview.com/ehs\">everything</a> at once.

The results are complicated to interpret - the within-family numbers often have such wide error bars that they overlap with both the across-family numbers and with zero - but looking qualitatively it seems like most scores on average lose about 25% of their risk reduction ability (though averages might not be the right way to do this, and some might be much more affected than others). Their website reports unadjusted, not within-family validated numbers; GP says they say this clearly on their site (which is true), Herasight counters that they still present their numbers as applicable to embryo selection (which is also true). To get the most applicable-to-embryo-selection numbers, you might want to adjust GP&#8217;s stated numbers down somewhat; it&#8217;s hard to say exactly how much, but maybe 20 - 25%?</p></li><li><p>Herasight has their within-family validation results in their white paper. They say there is no significant decrease in accuracy for 16 of their 17 disease risk predictors; the last, osteoporosis, has a minor decrease. They intend to publish more on their trait predictors soon.</p></li><li><p>Orchid say they validate within-family whenever possible, although certain conditions are too rare to do so properly. They present within-family results for seven of their scores <a href=\"https://guides.orchidhealth.com/post/using-genetic-risk-scores-to-compare-disease-risk-within-families\">here</a>; none show any significant decrease in accuracy.</p></li><li><p>Before I got to this question, Nucleus asked me not to send them further questions. But their website says:<br /><br />&#187; &#8220;<em>Research shows that polygenic scores for diseases are less likely to be impacted by factors that could confound predictions, like assortative mating, where people tend to marry those with similar characteristics (13). Furthermore, research shows that the heritability of these phenotypes don&#8217;t change across relatives and people who are unrelated, indicating true direct genetic effects (14). Recent research also shows, compared to behavioral genetics phenotypes like IQ, clinical phenotypes like migraines have negligible indirect effects (15).&#8221;<br /><br /></em>This is not how other experts I talked to described the state of the research, but it suggests Nucleus doesn&#8217;t see a need to within-family-validate their scores.</p><p></p></li></ul></div></div><div class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-anchor-10\" id=\"footnote-10\" target=\"_self\">10</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>See <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/missing-heritability-much-more-than\">Missing Heritability: Much More Than You Wanted To Know</a> for more on Young&#8217;s research.</p></div></div><div class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-anchor-11\" id=\"footnote-11\" target=\"_self\">11</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>One typical way to quantify whether health interventions are worth it is through DALYs (and the very similar QALYs).

First, so far the government isn&#8217;t paying - you are - and you may value money differently than the government does (for example, if you have less than $100,000, you will not spend $100,000 for any number of QALYs; if you&#8217;re a billionaire, you might happily spend tens of millions on a single QALY).
