There's since been four new versions since then, with the November release putting us in beta. Between work and holidays I didn't make much progress in December, but there will be a 0.6 release in the next week or two.</p> <p>People have asked me if the book will ever be available in print, and my answer to that is \"when it's done\". To keep \"when it's done\" from being \"never\", I'm committing myself to <strong>have the book finished by July.</strong> That means roughly six more releases between now and the official First Edition. Then I will start looking for a way to get it printed.</p> <h3>The Current State and What Needs to be Done</h3> <p>Right now the book is 26,000 words. For the most part, the structure is set\u2014 I don't plan to reorganize the chapters much. But I still need to fix shortcomings identified by the reader feedback. In particular, a few topics need more on real world applications, and the Alloy chapter is pretty weak. There's also a bunch of notes and todos and \"fix this\"s I need to go over.</p> <p>I also",

                "<p>I started this piece in late November. It&#8217;s a piece I usually write Christmas as a kick-off to the new year. The precise process by which this yearly piece arrives is a mystery. Probably the mental reset that comes with the New Year. So, what&#8217;s with the first draft showing up before Thanksgiving?</p>\n<p>As I wrote <a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-cleanse/\">earlier</a>, I&#8217;ve been turtling since the US Election. Mostly avoiding all news, standing up and politely walking away when the conversation sways towards politics, deeply diving back into a <a href=\"https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/\">video game legend</a>. You know. Classic avoidance.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also writing a new book about \u2014 wait for it \u2014 that&#8217;s right, leadership. This topic was inevitable, but since the election, I&#8217;ve been wondering whether there is something original or new to write, given the current circumstances in the United States.</p>\n<p>Probably not.</p>\n<p>Like many friends, I&#8217;ve chosen to focus my efforts on family, community, and work. Attempting to comprehend, let alone influence, the larger narratives on the planet strikes me as a particularly futile effort in what appears to be a post-literate society.</p>\n<p>So, at the beginning of this year, I want to tell you a small leadership tale about the Rands Leadership Slack and why it works.</p>\n<p>The Rands Leadership Slack is a community I created on June 1st, 2015. It&#8217;s, yes, a Slack, and as of this writing, it has almost 35,000 members. Over 5,000 of those members are active every week. There are over 800 public channels, and while many are focused on the craft of leadership, there are hundreds of non-leadership channels. I now play a game where I wonder, &#8220;Is there a channel for X?&#8221; I find said channel and over 100 members are usually already chatting about the topic.</p>\n<p>While I am proud of this <a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com\">blog</a>, the Rands Leadership Slack is the most impactful thing I&#8217;ve built outside my family and job. Thousands of community members discuss and learn from each other every day.</p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s hard to have nice things on the Internet.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how we do it.</p>\n<h2>Endless Hard Work</h2>\n<p>First, there was a bit of luck. I was pretty quick to see Slack would be a good tool for this type of community, but Slack, by choice, was not designed for community. The free plan is designed to give you a taste but not a scalable community. After 90 days (or a certain number of messages?), you must pay to see your history. This was Slack&#8217;s chosen business model.</p>\n<p>I spoke at Slack before I became the VP of Engineering, and they graciously agreed to comp me a pro edition of Slack with no restrictions. They don&#8217;t do this anymore. Don&#8217;t ask. This generosity allows us to see the entirety of Rands Leadership Slack, which gives the community memory and history.</p>\n<p>Second, there is endless hard work.</p>\n<p>I use the process for each application, which you can read about <a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/\">here</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Receive an email from an applicant.</li>\n<li>Read the email and determine if they can follow directions.</li>\n<li>If they can&#8217;t, send them a follow-up email that explains the directions again. This is a template. I don&#8217;t type this each time.</li>\n<li>If they can follow directions, send them the invite plus the onboarding directions, which ask them to read the Code of Conduct. Set their profile image to anything but the default, and once logged in, introduce themselves on intros and drop me a direct message on Slack.</li>\n<li>If new members directly message me (I feel 40% of the new members do this), respond briefly but thoughtfully. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>There was a window where existing members could invite new members, but as I wanted everyone to experience the same onboarding, all applicants now follow the same process. My estimate is that I&#8217;ve sent around 39,000 emails (roughly 10% of invited applicants never joined).</p>\n<p>39,000. Spread that over nine years, that&#8217;s not huge amount of daily work, but it is a process I have consistently followed for almost a decade. Many applicants who are aware of the size of the community assume there is either a small army of admins who handle this or that we&#8217;ve got robots doing the work. We don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s just me. 39,000 mails.</p>\n<p>While the size of the community is an essential aspect of the community, this is not what makes it valuable.</p>\n<h2>Listen, Understand, and Learn</h2>\n<p>Given the by-design upfront choice not to open the floodgates on user growth has never been outrageous; it has been steady. This gentle and mostly predictable user growth means that social breakdowns that occur when many strangers are suddenly shoved together don&#8217;t occur\u2026 as fast.</p>\n<p>Around the five thousand-member mark, we had the first community request for a Code of Conduct. We had the first serious issue with a member where it was clear that I, the only admin at the time, would need to act. But how? And based on what? My random judgment? At that time, I had this aspirational but erroneous belief that because it was a leadership community, members would bring their best leadership skills to the table, and the Code of Conduct or other cultural artifacts were unnecessary.</p>\n<p>My resistance to calls for a Code of Conduct and subsequent additional requests for a formal administration team was impressive\u2026 and delusional. I was in New York at the time and spending multiple hours each morning with requests for comment from the community when I finally threw up my hands, found what looked like a good Code of Conduct on the Internet, branched it, touched it up with a smidge of Rands<img alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" />, and sent it to the complainers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Happy now?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>wut.</p>\n<p>The magnitude of the impact of the decision to create our <a href=\"https://github.com/randsleadershipslack/documents-and-resources/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md\">Code of Conduct</a> dwarfs my decision to keep growth sensible by designing a robot-unfriendly complex application process. The fact that it exists addresses many initial concerns of the community. Its regular use in conversations within the community gives us a useful playbook for deconstructing complex people issues. Most of every week since the Code of Conduct landed, I&#8217;ve used to explain a bit of this community to another member. Most months, I take time to edit it to help clarify the thinking laid out in the artifact. Policy changes land in the document multiple times a year because I do what I initially failed to do when the community asked for its existence \u2014 I listen.</p>\n<p>When I realized the single best feedback source on what the community needed was the community, my job became obvious. Not enforcer, but educator. This feedback does not arrive conveniently. It&#8217;s usually packaged inside high drama. Two or three, or fifty members are ready to fight. Tempers are often high. When they show up, I clench my jaw and remember that while they might not know it, they are teaching me about the community, and <strong>I have to listen to understand the lesson</strong>. I have to empathize with the concerns, but not so much that I participate in the often heated emotions. My job is to ask questions to gather as many perspectives as possible. Finally, I must decide: &#8220;Does our Code of Conduct help resolve this situation? Or does it need to evolve?&#8221;</p>\n<p>I need to find the lesson and then do the work to teach that lesson to everyone else.</p>\n<h2>Lead Peacefully</h2>\n<p>One of the favorite lines from the Code of Conduct:</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a leadership community, we believe peer-to-peer discussions, feedback, and corrections can help build a stronger, safer, more informed, and more welcoming community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I interview and hire a new set of admins every two years, and within a few months of their start, a new conflict emerges in the community. As new admins, they ask me for advice, and I point them at this part of the Code of Conduct and ask some version of it: &#8220;Did you see if they attempted to resolve the situation themselves? It is a leadership Slack, after all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But shouldn&#8217;t we help?&#8221; they ask.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are helping by suggesting they use their leadership skills to attempt to resolve this situation by themselves.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to make instant emotional assumptions about other humans, especially after decades of training on social networks. Our culture asks members to do the work, step outside of themselves and consider the perspectives of others to find a lesson they might not have seen. It doesn&#8217;t always work, but it&#8217;s where we start.</p>\n<p>RLS will celebrate its 10th anniversary later this year. It is the highest-quality, most inclusive, and most authentic leadership community on the planet.</p>\n<p>And it only took one hack: Hard work. All the time.</p>\n<p>Happy New Year.</p>"

                "<p><strong>I.</strong></p><p><em><a href=\"https://nosetgauge.substack.com/\">No Set Gauge</a></em> has a great essay on <a href=\"https://nosetgauge.substack.com/p/capital-agi-and-human-ambition\">Capital, AGI, and Human Ambition</a>, where he argues that if humankind survives the Singularity, the likely result is a future of eternal stagnant wealth inequality.</p><p>The argument: post-Singularity, AI will take over all labor, including entrepreneurial labor. Working at or founding a business will no longer provide social mobility. Everyone will have access to ~equally good AI investment advisors, so everyone will make the same rate of return. Therefore, everyone&#8217;s existing pre-singularity capital will grow at the same rate. Although the absolute growth rate of the economy may be spectacular, the overall wealth distribution will stay approximately fixed.</p><p>Moreover, the period just before the Singularity may be one of ballooning inequality, as some people navigate the AI transition better than others; for example, shares in AI companies may go up by orders of magnitude relative to everything else, creating a new class of billionaires or trillionaires. These people will then stay super-rich forever (possibly literally if immortality is solved, otherwise through their descendants), while those who started the Singularity without capital remain poor forever.</p><p>Finally, modern democracies pursue redistribution (and are otherwise responsive to non-elite concerns) partly out of geopolitical self interest. Under capitalism (as opposed to eg feudalism), national power depends on a strong economy, and a strong economy benefits from educated, globally-mobile, and substantially autonomous bourgeoisie and workforce. Once these people have enough power, they demand democracy, and once they have democracy, they demand a share of the pie; it&#8217;s hard to be a rich First World country without also being a liberal democracy (China is trying hard, but hasn&#8217;t quite succeeded, and even their limited success depends on things like America not opening its borders to Chinese skilled labor). Cheap AI labor (including entrepreneurial labor) removes a major force pushing countries to operate for the good of their citizens (though even without this force, we might expect legacy democracies to continue at least for a while). So we might expect the future to have less redistribution than the present.</p><p>This may not result in catastrophic poverty. Maybe the post-Singularity world will be rich enough that even a tiny amount of redistribution (eg UBI) plus private charity will let even the poor live like kings (though <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fPvssZk3AoDzXwfwJ/universal-basic-income-and-poverty\">see here</a> for a strong objection). Even so, the idea of a small number of immortal trillionaires controlling most of the cosmic endowment for eternity may feel weird and bad. From <em>No Set Gauge</em>:</p><blockquote><p>In the best case, this is a world like a more unequal, unprecedentedly static, and much richer Norway: a massive pot of non-human-labour resources (oil :: AI) has benefits that flow through to everyone, and yes some are richer than others but everyone has a great standard of living (and <a href=\"https://nosetgauge.substack.com/p/death-is-bad\">ideally</a> also lives forever). The only realistic forms of human ambition are playing local social and political games within your social network and class. If you don't have a lot of capital (and maybe not even then), you don't have a chance of affecting the broader world anymore. Remember: the AIs are better poets, artists, philosophers&#8212;everything; why would anyone care what some human does, unless that human is someone they personally know? Much like in feudal societies the answer to \"why is this person powerful?\" would usually involve some long family history, perhaps ending in a distant ancestor who had fought in an important battle (\"my great-great-grandfather fought at Bosworth Field!\"), anyone of importance in the future will be important because of something they or someone they were close with did in the pre-AGI era (\"oh, my uncle was technical staff at OpenAI\"). The children of the future will live their lives in the shadow of their parents, with social mobility extinct. I think you should definitely feel a non-zero amount of existential horror at this, even while acknowledging that it could've gone a lot worse.</p></blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t think about these scenarios too often - partly because it&#8217;s so hard to predict what will happen after the Singularity, and partly because everything degenerates into crazy science-fiction scenarios so quickly that I burn a little credibility every time I talk about it. </p><p>Still, if we&#8217;re going to discuss this, we should get it right - so let&#8217;s talk crazy science fiction. When I read this essay, I found myself asking three questions. First, why might its prediction fail to pan out? Second, how can we actively prevent it from coming to pass? Third, assuming it does come to pass, how could a smart person maximize their chance of being in the aristocratic capitalist class?</p><p>(So they can give to charity? Sure, let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s so they can give to charity.)</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>Here are some reasons to doubt this thesis.</p><p><strong>First</strong>, maybe AI will kill all humans. Some might consider this a deeper problem than wealth inequality - though I am constantly surprised how few people are in this group.</p><p><strong>Second</strong>, maybe AI will overturn the gameboard so thoroughly that normal property relations will lose all meaning. Frederic Jameson famously said that it was &#8220;easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism&#8221;, and even if this is literally correct we can at least spare some thought for the latter. Maybe the first superintelligences will be so well-aligned that they rule over us like benevolent gods, either immediately leveling out our petty differences and inequalities, or giving wealthy people a generation or two to enjoy their relative status so they don&#8217;t feel &#8220;robbed&#8221; while gradually transitioning the world to a post-scarcity economy. I am not optimistic about this, because it would require that AI companies tell AIs to use their own moral judgment instead of listening to humans. This doesn&#8217;t seem like a very human thing to do - it&#8217;s always in AI companies&#8217; interest to tell the AI to follow the AI company. Governments could step in, but it&#8217;s always in <em>their</em> interest to tell the AI to follow the government. Even if an AI company was selfless enough to attempt this, it might not be a good idea; you never really know how aligned an AI is, and you might want it to have an off switch in case it tries something really crazy. Most of the scenarios where this works involve some kind of objective morality that any sufficiently intelligent being will find compelling, even when they&#8217;re programmed to want something else. Big if true.</p><p><strong>Third</strong>, maybe governments will intervene. During the immediate pre-singularity period, governments will have lots of chances to step in and regulate AI. A natural demand might be that the AIs obey the government over their parent company. Even if governments don&#8217;t do this, the world might be so multipolar (either several big AI companies in a stalemate against each other, or many smaller institutions with open source AIs) that nobody can get a coalition of 51% of powerful actors to coup and overthrow the government (in the same way that nobody can get that coalition today). Or the government might itself control many AIs and be too powerful a player to coup. Then normal democratic rules would still apply. Even if voters oppose wealth taxes today, when capitalism is still necessary as an engine of economic growth, they might be less generous when faced with the idea of immortal unemployed plutocrats lording it over them forever. Enough taxes to make r &lt; g (in Piketty&#8217;s formulation) would eventually result in universal equality. I actually find this one pretty likely.</p><p><strong>Fourth, </strong>what about reproduction? Historically, family growth has cut many large fortunes down to size; if the original tycoon has four children, his fortune is quartered; if each of <em>them</em> has four children, it&#8217;s sixteenthed, and eventually the great-great-great grandchildren end up as normal middle-class people. This tactic works better when rates of return are low and average family size is high; early Singularity rates of return will be stratospheric, so you might be tempted to dismiss this consideration. But this would be premature. Far future technology will revolutionize reproduction; if you have artificial wombs and robot nannies (or some way of accelerating growth), then you can pay to have as many children as you want, even up to thousands or millions. If there is UBI, some entity will have to limit the number of allowed children (it&#8217;s not fair for a poor person to generate a million children and force society to give payments to all of them). But depending on how this shakes out, some rich people might decide to have very many kids (cf. Elon Musk). I still doubt this will matter much; even if some plutocrats split their fortune thousands of ways, others won&#8217;t, so the problem will remain.</p><p><strong>Fifth</strong>, what about space colonization? This will be a natural interest of post-singularity humans. Someone will have to divy up galactic property; someone will have to fund the colony ships; either way gives a chance for someone to think about wealth inequality on the ensuing colonies. But also, there are 3,000 billionaires in the world today and 400 billion stars in the galaxy. There&#8217;s no way to get one current-billionaire per star, and (as we already discussed), after the Singularity, wealth inequality ceases to increase further. Playing out how this could work, most of the options seem benign, for example:</p><ul><li><p>All the plutocrats go live on an awesome gated community world together. All the regular poor people with UBIs go live on worlds of other people like them. The average person in 10,000 AD has never met a person with a different wealth level than themselves, and would have to take a long starship ride to do so.</p></li><li><p>Each plutocrat declares themselves immortal god-king of a different colony world. They compete with each other and with other non-plutocrat-run colonies to attract subjects, probably by offering them better material conditions. People can choose between them, or stay on Earth, or pool their resources and figure out some other plan. Probably the average subject never meets their god-king, and all their interactions are with neighbors of the same wealth level.</p></li><li><p>None of these things happen, and non-plutocrats are stuck on Earth while the plutocrats colonize the galaxy. It doesn&#8217;t make sense for 3,000 people to colonize the galaxy on their own, so they will need some source of colonists. If they don&#8217;t use poor people, then whom? Maybe their descendants? Maybe genetically-engineered people they design to their own specifications? After a few millennia, the overwhelming majority of the human race would be these descendants/designer children, with the poor people left on Earth being a rounding error. We might regret the sort of historical discontinuity that caused legacy humans to lose control of the future, but the plutocrat would probably treat their descendants pretty well, and wealth inequality (as measured by something like Gini) would probably be very low, since there&#8217;s no reason for one plutocrat-descendant to be richer than another.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Sixth</strong>, maybe this is less plutocrats vs. everyone else and more a fractal pattern of every type of possible inequality. Suppose that rate of return is stratospheric (~1000x/year?) in the first few years of the Singularity, and that everyone gets a $50K UBI. If you keep and invest half your UBI, you can have $25 million at the beginning of year two, while your less thrifty friends are still only getting their $50,000. Sure, neither of you will compare to the guy who started the Singularity with $1 billion and turned it into $1 trillion, but you never expected to meet that guy anyway, and $25 million vs. $50,000 is still plenty unequal. But also - how many people do we expect there to be a thousand years after the Singularity? If we&#8217;re colonizing the galaxy and so on, surely it&#8217;s at least hundreds of billions. Some of those people will be much older than others - maybe eight billion pre-singularity humans (now-immortal) and 92 billion post-singularity descendants. The 8 billion pre-singularity humans will have had 1000 years to invest their pre-Singularity capital (however small) and to collect, invest, and compound their UBIs. Each of them (or rather, us) will be as gods compared to the new kids who are &#8220;just&#8221; collecting their $50,000 UBI every year. So the really interesting wealth inequality may not be between modern plutocrats and modern poor people, but between generations. </p><p><strong>Seventh</strong>, maybe we will be so post-scarcity that there won&#8217;t be anything to buy. This won&#8217;t be literally true - maybe ancient pre-singularity artifacts or real estate on Earth will be prestige goods - but some people having more prestige goods than others doesn&#8217;t sound like a particularly malign form of inequality.</p><p><strong>Eighth, </strong>maybe we&#8217;ll all upload ourselves to virtual worlds. This would be an even stronger version of the above; a UBI might provide enough compute to customize your virtual world however you wanted (although, again, there might be NFT-esque prestige goods). If you wanted, you could live in an experience machine where you were the richest person around. Or all the poor people could live in a simulation together where there were no rich people and everyone was equal, and all the rich people would be stuck in their own gated simulation with nothing to do except compliment each other on how rich they are, forever.</p><p>Sorry, I told you this would degenerate into weird unprovable sci-fi scenarios. But taken together, these stories make the technofeudalism argument feel less compelling.</p><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>Supposing we still worry about this possibility, how can we prevent it from coming to pass?</p><p>OpenAI was previously a &#8220;capped nonprofit&#8221;, where investors could make up to a 100x return, and all further profits went to a nonprofit arm. The exact mission of the nonprofit arm was never clear, but given Altman&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sam-altman-universal-basic-income-study-open-research/\">interest in universal basic income </a>and his statements around the company&#8217;s founding, plausibly the idea was to create superintelligence, obtain approximately all the money in the world, use a tiny sliver of it to pay back investors, and distribute the rest as a UBI. You can say what you want about whether to trust companies in general or Sam Altman in particular, but -conditional on being an AI company - I think this is about as socially responsible as you can get. The investors don&#8217;t get enough to become technofeudalist barons, and the vast majority of gains still go to the public. </p><p>Now OpenAI wants to change the deal. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-lays-out-plan-shift-new-for-profit-structure-2024-12-27/\">They announced over Christmas</a> (definitely when you announce a thing if you&#8217;re proud of it and want other people to know about it) that they plan to shift from a non-profit-with-an-embedded-for-profit to a for-profit-with-an-attached-nonprofit. Their spokesperson Liz Bourgeois (definitely what you call your spokesperson when you&#8217;re not plotting a technofeudalist takeover) <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2024-10-12/changing-openais-nonprofit-structure-would-raise-questions-about-its-future\">said that</a> &#8220;the organization&#8217;s missions and goals remained constant, though the way it&#8217;s carried out its mission has evolved alongside advances in technology&#8221;.</p><p>I don&#8217;t fully understand the difference between these two models, but two quotes (plus common sense) suggest the new one will be worse. From <a href=\"https://archive.is/Q2HuU#selection-2473.0-2473.305\">here</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Shifting to a simpler for-profit structure would be welcomed by the start-up&#8217;s financial partners, according to one investor in OpenAI. &#8220;All preferred investors have a profit cap, there&#8217;s a lot of talk about making it a more traditional investment so we&#8217;re not capped on our upside,&#8221; the person said. </p></blockquote><p>And <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/why-our-structure-must-evolve-to-advance-our-mission/\">OpenAI&#8217;s blog itself</a> says that the new nonprofit, rather than the old mission of &#8220;ensur[ing] AI benefits all society&#8221;, will:</p><blockquote><p>Pursue charitable initiatives in sectors such as health care, education, and science.</p></blockquote><p>Pessimistically, it sounds like they&#8217;re trying to change the deal from &#8220;investors can&#8217;t capture the Singularity for themselves, and profits get paid out as UBI&#8221; to &#8220;investors will capture the Singularity, and we&#8217;ll buy off everyone else&#8217;s birthright by funding some hospitals or something pre-singularity&#8221;.</p><p>Altman has fired all independent board members (except possibly Adam D&#8217;Angelo?) and handpicked their replacements. This was apparently a response to the 2023 board coup, but the coup itself was caused by Altman trying to fire independent board members, so the exact cause and effect is unclear. In any case, he&#8217;ll probably succeed at getting board permission to change the structure. The main obstacle now is legal and regulatory - people who contributed to the charity may have grounds to sue. One of those people is Elon Musk, who hates OpenAI, loves suing people, and low-key controls the country. Sounds like everyone will have a fun time.</p><p>I don&#8217;t really understand the laws here, OpenAI is tight-lipped about the details of their new arrangement, and even their old arrangement was kind of confusing. One of OpenAI&#8217;s competitors, Anthropic, also has some kind of confusing public benefit status with unclear ability to really bind them. But if I were concerned about technofeudalism, my first priority would be to understand what&#8217;s going on here better and, in the very likely scenario in which it&#8217;s bad, try to figure out how to push these companies back to a model more like OpenAI c. 2020.</p><p>(if you think you understand this situation deeply and want to talk to me, send me an email)</p><p>The other direction would be to propose a wealth tax. This seems less promising as a direction for pre-singularity activism; many powerful people and coalitions (eg Elizabeth Warren, Thomas Piketty) are already fighting pretty hard for a wealth tax and losing; given Trump&#8217;s election victory, we can expect them to continue to lose for at least the next four years. The efforts of all Singularity believers combined wouldn&#8217;t add a percentage point to these people&#8217;s influence or likelihood of success.</p><p>Finally, one could assume that a post-singularity democratic government would naturally implement a wealth tax, and view one&#8217;s own role as ensuring that the post-singularity government stays democratic. I&#8217;ve been wondering lately if anyone (Leopold?) is explicitly asking the government to check AI model specs and see whether they include phrases like &#8220;in cases of conflict, listen to your parent company&#8221; or &#8220;in cases of conflict, listen to the US government&#8221;. A polite letter from the White House asking to shift from the former to the latter would be an easy sell now, but might have cosmic ramifications later on.</p><p><strong>IV.</strong></p><p>Suppose we believe the case for technofeudalism and, like Venkatesh Rao, are willing to <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/be-slightly-evil/\">&#8220;be slightly evil&#8221;</a>. How might we increase our share of the pie? Obviously most of the advice here is just to get rich in the normal way. Is there anything else?</p><p>If we expect the Singularity to grow the economy by orders of magnitude, it might be worth investing in stocks rather than other instruments (eg bonds) that pay out a fixed sum. Are AI stocks better than other stocks? Not obviously - see the classic stories about how the computing revolution failed to enrich IBM, or the Internet revolution failed to enrich Yahoo. NVIDIA? Seems like a good bet for the early stages, but it&#8217;s purely intellectual labor and therefore replaceable after superintelligence; at some point you would want to switch to physical capital. All of this seems a lot more dangerous than just investing in index funds; the upside is so high that it seems silly to risk missing it by over-optimizing.</p><p>If humankind increases in population and expands throughout the universe, anything with a fixed amount (ie that post-singularity populations can&#8217;t make more of) will balloon in value. This includes land on Earth and authentic art/artifacts (in 10,000,000 AD, everything that exists today will be an artifact, but maybe older and scarcer artifacts will be more valuable).</p><p>What about cryptocurrency? Since many cryptos have fixed number (eg Bitcoin&#8217;s 21 million), this is tempting if you expect any post-singularity demand. But I would worry that if superintelligences wanted to use crypto, they would invent some much better cryptocurrency that somehow occupies all three corners of the <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/glossary/blockchain-trilemma\">blockchain trilemma</a> at once. Anyone with obsolete human-designed cryptocurrencies would be left holding the bag. Still, that hasn&#8217;t happened yet (despite being technologically creaky, Bitcoin is still on top), so maybe legacy systems have some special appeal.</p><p>I can&#8217;t think of anything that really beats the gold standard advice of &#8220;be rich&#8221; and &#8220;don&#8217;t be poor&#8221;.</p>"

                "<p>The Attorney General of Massachusetts recently <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/doc/attorney-general-and-uberlyft-settlement-agreement/download\">announced</a> that drivers for ride-sharing companies must be paid at least $32.50 per hour.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if you\u2019re a hardcore libertarian, then you probably hate with the minimum wage. You need no convincing and we can part now on good terms.</p>\n\n<p>But what if you\u2019re part of the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/04/22/most-americans-support-a-15-federal-minimum-wage/\">vast majority</a> of people who like the minimum wage? What if you think the minimum wage is awesome and you want to expand it? That\u2019s fine. I won\u2019t try to change your mind! But even so, there are strong reasons to be skeptical about this policy.</p>\n\n<p>Because: If you read closely, you\u2019ll see that Massachusetts\u2019 rule is that drivers must be paid $32.50 <em>for hours that they spend driving passengers around</em>. For the time they spend waiting for passengers to request rides, they will still be paid $0. And when you screw around with prices, you change the amount of time they spend waiting around.</p>\n\n<p>This kind of policy <em>could</em> help drivers. But if you analyze things carefully, it can\u2019t help them very much. In the end, this policy is mostly equivalent to forcing riders to pay extra to subsidize drivers sitting around doing nothing.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ll first give the intuition with words and drawings, and then I\u2019ll prove it with a tiny bit of math.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"story-time\">Story time</h2>\n\n<p>Say there\u2019s a city\u2014call it Billiard Ball Falls\u2014where people behave in suspiciously convenient ways. All rides take exactly one hour, including the time for the driver to get to the rider. And demand for rides is constant over time.</p>\n\n<p>Now, how many rides would you take if they only cost $1? Personally, I\u2019d buy fresh produce and visit friends across town more often. Eventually, I might move further away from work. But if rides cost $1000, I\u2019d only take them in emergencies. Assuming most people are like me, the total <strong>demand</strong> for rides from all people will decrease as the price goes up. Maybe something like this:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/prices/d1.svg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, if drivers were paid $1 per ride, who would drive? Maybe a tiny number of very bored and lonely people? I certainly wouldn\u2019t. But if I could earn $1000 per ride, I\u2019d feel morally obligated to drive and donate much of the money to charity. So the total <strong>supply</strong> of rides from all people, is some kind of upward-sloping curve:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/prices/d2.svg\" /></p>\n\n<p>In a free market, prices will\u2014under some not-too-crazy assumptions\u2014eventually settle at whatever price makes these curves intersect.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/prices/d3.svg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Riders pay around $2.33 per ride and drivers earn around $2.33 per hour. A story as old as ECON 101.</p>\n\n<p>But we\u2019re here to talk about something more interesting. What if the government mandates a new, higher, price?</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/prices/d4.svg\" /></p>\n\n<p>We have a problem. Since rides now cost more than the old market price, people will buy fewer rides.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/prices/d5.svg\" /></p>\n\n<p>But since pay is higher, <em>more</em> people will want to be drivers.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/prices/d6.svg\" /></p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s not going to work. Riders can\u2019t buy 300 rides/hour while drivers are selling 500 rides/hour. That would violate conservation of ride.</p>\n\n<p>Ordinarily, what would happen in this situation is prices would go down. This would cause drivers to drive a bit less and riders to ride a bit more and this would continue until the price went back to the market price. But that can\u2019t happen when the price is fixed. So what happens instead?</p>\n\n<p>Well, demand can\u2019t change. People will want to buy some number of rides at the government price and that\u2019s that.</p>\n\n<p>In this situation, supply matches demand through a decrease in the <strong>utilization</strong> of drivers. Think of it like this: Prices are high, so lots of people want to offer rides. But there\u2019s a shortage of customers, so drivers will have to wait around a while before they get a customer.</p>\n\n<p>Now there\u2019s a subtle point here. (One that took me quite a while to figure out.)</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s easiest to understand with an example. Say the government mandates a price of $30 per ride and say drivers spend <em>U=\u2154</em> of their time actually working. Then the effective wage is $20 per hour, so people supply <em>SUPPLY($20)</em> hours of work. But only <em>\u2154</em> of those hours actually become rides, so the number of rides supplied is <em>\u2154 \u00d7 SUPPLY($20)</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Get that? When drivers spend more time waiting around, this decreases supply in <em>two</em> ways.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>When drivers wait around, they don\u2019t create any rides (duh).</li>\n  <li>When drivers wait around, this makes their <em>effective</em> wage lower, so they drive less.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If the government mandates a price of <em>P</em> and drivers spend a fraction <em>U</em> of their time waiting around, and you account for both of the above effects, the actual number of rides supplied will be <em>U\u00d7SUPPLY(U\u00d7P)</em>. (Through the logic in the above example.)</p>\n\n<p>OK, so remember where we left our example.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/prices/d6.svg\" /></p>\n\n<p>The supply curve <em>SUPPLY(P)</em> is the same as <em>U\u00d7SUPPLY(U\u00d7P)</em> when <em>U</em> is 1. What happens in this situation is that <em>U</em> decreases until <em>U\u00d7SUPPLY(U\u00d7P)</em> intersects with the demand curve at the government price. This happens to be when <em>U</em> is around 0.9, meaning drivers spend 90% of their time driving customers around and 10% of their time waiting around:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/prices/d7.svg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Now what? Now we\u2019re done. We just have to remember that the effective wage of drivers is government price <em>times the utilization rate</em>. In this case that\u2019s around 10% lower:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/prices/d8.svg\" /></p>\n\n<p>So, in this example, after the government increases prices:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Riders pay more.</li>\n  <li>Riders take fewer rides.</li>\n  <li>Drivers spend more time waiting around.</li>\n  <li>Driver wages <em>don\u2019t increase</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, the effective wage usually <em>will</em> change, at least at little. It depends on the situation.</p>\n\n<p>In one extreme, people could be totally insensitive to prices. No matter how much rides costs, riders keep buying the same number of rides. And no matter how much drivers are paid, no one works more hours. In this case, forcing a higher price won\u2019t decrease utilization\u2014it will just transfer more money from riders to drivers.</p>\n\n<p>In the other extreme, people could be <em>very</em> sensitive to prices. When prices go up, riders cut back on rides and drivers try to work more. In this case, forcing a higher price will decrease utilization a lot and the effective wage might even go <em>down</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But how exactly does this work? In realistic situations, how much will a price increase actually help drivers?</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m glad you asked!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"science-time\">Science time</h2>\n\n<p>Humans encompass multitudes. There are infinite possible supply and demand curves. This complicates things for bloggers trying to disparage Massachusetts ride-sharing price minimums.</p>\n\n<p>So why don\u2019t you just try it? Here\u2019s a calculator. Enter whatever supply and demand curves you want, and how much the government will increase prices. It will then calculate the utilization rate and wage drivers earn at the new equilibrium.

It <em>is</em> possible, but requires you to assume that people basically don\u2019t care about prices. For example, if DEMAND(P)=101-P and SUPPLY(W)=99+W, then the market price is $1/ride. If the government increases that to $2/ride, then utilization only drops slightly to 0.981, so the effective wage goes up from $1/hr to $1.961/hr.</p>\n\n<p>But is it realistic to assume that people don\u2019t care about prices? Do you really have to assume that? Can we prove anything with \u201crealistic\u201d assumptions?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"math-time\">Math time</h2>\n\n<p>In this section, I\u2019ll prove that that when the government increases prices, the absolute best that drivers can hope for is that 50% of the extra money shows up in wages. For example, if the market price is $20/ride (and the market wage $30/hr) and the government increases the price to $30/ride, then the highest possible new wage is $25/hr. And probably less.</p>\n\n<p>(If you hate math and you trust me, feel free to skip this section.)</p>\n\n<p>To obviate with the vastness of the human condition with its infinite supply and demand curves, I\u2019m going to analyze a situation where the price <em>starts</em> at the market price and then is changed to be just <em>slightly</em> higher. This is helpful, because then we only need to worry about the supply and demand near the equilibrium, which reduces everything to just four numbers.</p>\n\n<p>This is helpful, because it means we only need to care about the shape of the supply and demand curves near the equilibrium, which reduces things to just four numbers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>THEOREM</strong>.

Now, define the utilization <em>U(P)</em> to the the fraction of time that drivers will spend actually driving people around if the government mandates the price to be <em>P</em>.

But if we assume that the current price <em>P</em> is the market price then we get</p>\n\n  <p><em>DEMAND\u2019(P)</em>\n<br /> <em>= d/dP U(P) \u00d7 SUPPLY(U(P) \u00d7 P)</em>\n<br /> <em>= U\u2019(P) \u00d7 SUPPLY(U(P) \u00d7 P) + U(P) \u00d7 d/dP SUPPLY(U(P) \u00d7 P)</em>\n<br /> <em>= U\u2019(P) \u00d7 SUPPLY(U(P) \u00d7 P) + U(P) \u00d7 SUPPLY\u2019(U(P) \u00d7 P) \u00d7 d/dP(P \u00d7 U(P))</em>\n<br /> <em>= U\u2019(P) \u00d7 SUPPLY(U(P) \u00d7 P) + U(P) \u00d7 SUPPLY\u2019(U(P) \u00d7 P) \u00d7 (U(P) + P U\u2019(P)).</em></p>\n\n  <p>Now if we assume <em>P</em> is currently the market price, then we have that <em>DEMAND(P)=SUPPLY(P)</em> and <em>U(P)=1</em>. Thus, the above equation becomes</p>\n\n  <p><em>DEMAND\u2019(P)</em>\n<br /> <em>= U\u2019(P) \u00d7 SUPPLY(P) + SUPPLY\u2019(P) \u00d7 (1 + P U\u2019(P))</em>\n<br /> <em>= U\u2019(P) \u00d7 (SUPPLY(P) + P SUPPLY\u2019(P))  + SUPPLY\u2019(P)</em>,</p>\n\n  <p>and so</p>\n\n  <p><em>U\u2019(P) = (DEMAND\u2019(P) - SUPPLY\u2019(P)) / (SUPPLY(P) + P SUPPLY\u2019(P)).</em></p>\n\n  <p>Now, the effective wage is</p>\n\n  <p><em>W(P) = P\u00d7U(P).</em></p>\n\n  <p>This means that the change is (when P is the current equilibrium)</p>\n\n  <p><em>W\u2019(P)</em>\n<br /> <em>= U(P) + P\u00d7U\u2019(P)</em>\n<br /> <em>= 1 + P\u00d7(DEMAND\u2019(P) - SUPPLY\u2019(P)) / (SUPPLY(P) + P SUPPLY\u2019(P))</em>\n<br /> <em>= (SUPPLY(P) + P\u00d7SUPPLY\u2019(P) + P\u00d7DEMAND\u2019(P)</em>\n<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <em>- P\u00d7SUPPLY\u2019(P)) / (SUPPLY(P) + P SUPPLY\u2019(P))</em>\n<br /> <em>= (SUPPLY(P)  + P\u00d7DEMAND\u2019(P)) / (SUPPLY(P) + P SUPPLY\u2019(P))</em>\n<br /> <em>= (SUPPLY(P)/P  + DEMAND\u2019(P)) / (SUPPLY(P)/P + SUPPLY\u2019(P))</em>\n<br /> <em>= (S/P  + DEMAND\u2019(P)) / (S/P + SUPPLY\u2019(P))</em></p>\n\n</details>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s try to understand what this means. First, recall our equilibrium graph:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/prices/d9.svg\" /></p>\n\n<p>The three quantities in the equation can be seen as the slopes of three lines in this graph.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/prices/d10.svg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Specifically:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>DEMAND(P)/P</em> is the slope of the line that goes from the origin to the equilibrium point. This is the number of rides that happen per dollar at the equilibrium point.</li>\n  <li><em>DEMAND\u2019(P)</em> is the slope of the demand curve at the equilibrium point. This is how sensitive demand is to changes in price. It\u2019s a negative number, since demand goes down when prices go up.</li>\n  <li><em>SUPPLY\u2019(P)</em> the slope of the supply curve at the equilibrium point. This is how sensitive supply is to changes in wages. This is a a positive number, since supply goes up when prices go up.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note that the government increasing prices could cause wages to go <em>down</em>. This will happen if demand is sensitive enough to prices near equilibrium:</p>\n\n<p><strong>COROLLARY</strong>. The change in wages <em>W\u2019(P)</em> is negative if and only if the magnitude of <em>DEMAND\u2019(P)</em> (a negative number) is larger than the magnitude of <em>SUPPLY(P)/P</em>.</p>\n\n<details>\n  \nPROOF\n\n\n  <p><em>SUPPLY\u2019(P)&gt;0</em> so the sign of <em>W\u2019(P)</em> is the same as the sign of <em>F/P  + DEMAND\u2019(P)=DEMAND(P)/P  + DEMAND\u2019(P)</em>.</p>\n\n</details>\n\n<p>I\u2019m not sure how likely it is that wages would actually go down in practice. When I try making up plausible-seeming supply and demand curves, wages do go down sometimes, but it\u2019s fairly rare, and even when it happens the decrease is usually small.</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a result that I think is more important in practice. Informally, it says that if the supply curve is \u201cupward sloping\u201d, then the increase in wages is at most 50% of the increase in prices. To me, this is the strongest argument against increasing prices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>COROLLARY</strong>. If <em>SUPPLY\u2019(P) &gt; SUPPLY(P)/P</em>, then <em>W\u2019(P)&lt;\u00bd</em>.</p>\n\n<details>\n  \nPROOF\n\n\n  <p><em>DEMAND\u2019(P)&lt;0</em>, so <em>W\u2019(P) \u2264 (F/P) / (F/P + SUPPLY\u2019(P))</em>. But if <em>SUPPLY\u2019(P) &gt; SUPPLY(P)/P</em>, then <em>(F/P + SUPPLY\u2019(P))&gt; 2(F/P)</em>.</p>\n\n</details>\n\n<p>When will the supply curve be upward sloping? Let me be show you what I\u2019m talking about:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/prices/d11.svg\" /></p>\n\n<p>If this is true, then I think we can fairly say that \u201cmost of the extra money the government is forcing people to pay doesn\u2019t manifest as extra wages\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>I claim this is <em>almost certainly</em> true.</p>\n\n<p>Think of it like this: If wages were half as much, would people drive half as much? Or less than half as much? I think it\u2019s less than half as much. This means that the orange curve in the above picture is going to be below the red line, and at least 50% of the extra money is \u201cwasted\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>But really, it\u2019s much worse than that. For one thing, this result basically assumes the worst case, where increasing prices doesn\u2019t decrease demand at all. In the real world, demand will go down and the increase in wages will be even less.</p>\n\n<p>For another, this doesn\u2019t even account for waste! Suppose a price increase made wages go up 25%, but drivers now only spend 50% of their time actually driving people around. Are you happy? I\u2019m not happy, because (1) this hurts riders and (2) it seems crazy to interfere with markets in ways that encourage people spend more time doing thing that aren\u2019t productive.</p>\n\n<p>(I\u2019m sure that all the results in this section are known, but it was easier\u2014and more fun\u2014to just re-derive it myself.)</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"discussion-time\">Discussion time</h2>\n\n<p>In practice, Massachusetts\u2019 policy probably isn\u2019t <em>quite</em> as bad as my simple model suggests: For one thing, in the real world, lower driver utilization will mean reduced wait times for riders, so the money isn\u2019t <em>totally</em> wasted. And the minimum of $32.50/hr only seems to apply when averaged over a few weeks. And maybe some of the extra money will come out of the profits of the ride-sharing company? (Though one can argue that reducing profits is also bad.)</p>\n\n<p>But still, if you want to run a command economy where the government sets prices, there are better ways of doing it! And this is not theoretical: New York mandates a minimum wage of $17.22/hr that <em>includes time waiting around</em>. The ridesharing companies responded to this as anyone could predict: They refuse to let drivers get on the clock at all. <em>Jacobin</em> <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2024/10/uber-lyft-driver-lockouts-wages\">bitterly calls this a \u201cloophole\u201d</a>, but\u2026 what are we hoping for here? The money has to come from somewhere. Without a magical supply of extra riders, you can\u2019t force prices above market rate without <em>some</em> kind of consequence!</p>\n\n<p>Now, New York\u2019s policy is kind of weird. It mandates a minimum wage, and then leaves it to companies to limit supply. The old-fashioned way of propping up driver pay is to limit taxi medallions, and then let the market price increase naturally. New York\u2019s policy is very indirect, but amounts to basically the same thing.</p>\n\n<p>(Incidentally, this isn\u2019t just a story about ride-sharing. It\u2019s also a decent model for why it\u2019s bad that American realtors were able to establish a monopoly where they can extract 6% of the value of anyone who wants to sell a home. That doesn\u2019t <em>just</em> take money away from home-selling and give it to real estate agents. It also subsidizes real-estate agents to spend lots of time competing with each other for clients in a way that does nothing to advance the welfare of general society.)</p>\n\n<p>So really, I think Massachusetts\u2019 policy is worse than bad\u2014it\u2019s a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Antoine,_Duke_of_Enghien#Impact_of_death\">mistake</a>. Riders pay more and get fewer rides. And for what? Basically to pay drivers to sit around, spending energy, wasting time, and increasing traffic. Healthy, ambitious societies do not do that.</p>"

Despite making <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/10/mark-zuckerberg-stands-for-voice-and-free-expression/\">a soaring speech</a> to the values of free speech back in 2019, Meta, together with Twitter, became one of the primary weapons for a political censorship regime that went into overdrive during the pandemic.<br /><br /></div><div>Both Meta and Twitter received <a href=\"https://x.com/mtaibbi/status/1598822959866683394\">direct instructions</a> from the US government, among other institutions, on what was to be considered allowable speech and what was to be banned. The specifics shifted over those awful years, but everything from questioning the origins of the Covid virus to disputing vaccine efficacy to objections on mass migration to the Hunter Biden laptop leak all qualified for heavy-handed intervention.<br /><br /></div><div>The primary rhetorical fig leaves for this censorship regime was &quot;hate speech&quot; and &quot;misinformation&quot;. Terms that almost immediately lost all objective content, and turned into mere descriptors of &quot;speech we don't like&quot;. Either because it was politically inconvenient or because it offended certain holy tenants of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Woke-Racism-Religion-Betrayed-America/dp/0593423062/\">woke religion</a> that reigned at the time.<br /><br /></div><div>But that era is now over. Between Meta and X, the gravity of the global discourse has swung dramatically in favor of free expression. I suspect that YouTube and Reddit will eventually follow suit as well. But even if they don't, it won't really matter. The forbidden opinions and inconvenient information will still be able to reach a wide audience.<br /><br /></div><div>That's a momentous and positive moment for the world. And it's a particularly proud moment for America, since this is all downstream from the country's first amendment protection of free speech.<br /><br /></div><div>But it's also adding to the growing chasm between America and Europe. And the United Kingdom in particular. While America is recovering from the authoritarian grip on free speech in terms of both social media policies and broader social consequences (remember cancel culture?), the Brits are <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr548zdmz3jo\">doubling down</a>.<br /><br /></div><div>Any post on social media made in Britain is liable to have those cute little bobbies show up at your door with a not-so-cute warrant for your arrest. The delusional UK police commissioner is even <a href=\"https://x.com/politvidchannel/status/1874889002073182329\">threatening to &quot;come after&quot; people</a> from around the world, if they write bad tweets.<br /><br /></div><div>And Europe isn't far behind. Thierry Breton, the former European Commissioner, spent much of last year threatening American tech companies, and <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-elon-musk-donald-trump-interview-thierry-breton-letter-social-media/\">Elon Musk in particular</a>, with draconian sanctions, if they failed to censor on the EU's behest. He has thankfully since been dismissed, but the sentiment of censorship is alive and well in the EU.<br /><br /></div><div>This is why the world needs America. From the UK to the EU to Brazil, China, Russia, and Iran, political censorship is very popular. And for a couple of dark years in the US, it looked like the whole world was about to be united in an authoritarian crackdown on speech of all sorts.<br /><br /></div><div>But Elon countered the spell. His acquisition of Twitter and its transformation into X was <em>the</em> pivotal moment for both American and global free speech. And if you allow yourself to zoom out from the day-to-day antics of the meme lord at large, you should be able to see clearly how the timeline split.</div><div><br />I know that's hard to do for a lot of people who've traded in their Trump Derangement Syndrome diagnosis for a Musk Derangement Syndrome variety (or simply added it to their inventory of mental challenges). And I get it. It's hard to divorce principles from people! We're all liable to mix and confuse the two.</div><div><br />And speaking of Trump, which, to be honest, I try not to do too often, because I know how triggering he is,\u00a0 credit is still due. There's no way this incredible vibe shift would have happened as quickly or as forcefully without his comeback win.</div><div><br />Now I doubt that any of his political opponents are going to give him any credit for this, even if they do perhaps quietly celebrate the pivot on free speech. And that's OK. I don't expect miracles, and we don't need them either. You don't need to love every champion of your principles to quietly appreciate their contributions.<br /><br /></div><div>Which very much reminds me of the historic lawsuit that the Jewish lawyers at the <a href=\"https://mjhnyc.org/events/when-nazis-came-to-illinois-the-history-of-the-skokie-case/\">ACLU (in its former glory) fought to allow literal nazis to match</a> in the streets of Skokie, Illinois. That case goes to the crux of free speech. That in order for you to voice your dissent on Trump or Musk or whatever, you need the protection of the first amendment to cover those who want to dissent in the opposite direction too.</div><div><br />That's a principle that's above the shifting winds and vibes of whoever is in power. It's entire purpose is to protect speech that's unpopular with the rulers of the moment. And as we've seen, electoral fortunes can change! It's in your own self interest to affirm a set of rules for participation in the political debate that live beyond the what's expedient for partisan success in the short term.</div><div><br />I for one am stoked about Meta's pivot on censorship. I've historically not exactly been Mark Zuckerberg's biggest fan, and I do think it's fair to question the authenticity of him and this move, but I'm not going to let any of that get in the way of applauding this monumental decision. The world needs America and its exceptional principles more than ever. I will cheer for Zuckerberg without reservation when he works in their service.</div><div><br />Now how do we get the UK and the EU to pivot as well?</div>\n</div>"

My parents are of hardscrabble rural West Virginia and rural North Carolina origins. They barely managed to claw their way to the bottom of the middle class by the time they ended up in Virginia. Unfortunately, due to the demons passed on to them by their parents, my father was an alcoholic and my mother participated in the drinking. She ended up divorcing my father when I was 16 years old. It was only after the divorce that my parents were able to heal themselves, heal their only child, and stop the drinking, which was so destructive to our family. If the divorce hadn&apos;t forced the issue, alcohol would have inevitably destroyed us all. <br /><br />My parents may not have done everything right, but they both unconditionally loved me. <strong>They taught me how to fully, deeply receive love, and the profound joy of reflecting that love upon everyone around you. </strong></p><p>I went on to attend public school in Chesterfield County, Virginia. In 1992 I graduated from the University of Virginia, founded by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\">Thomas Jefferson</a>.</p><p>During college, I worked at Safeway as a part-time cashier, earning the <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/history?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">federal minimum wage</a>, scraping together whatever money I could through government Pell grants, scholarships, and other part-time work to pay my college tuition. Even with <a href=\"https://www.salliemae.com/blog/in-state-vs-out-of-state-tuition/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">lower in-state tuition</a>, it was rocky. Sometimes I could barely manage tuition payments. And that was in 1992, when tuition was only $3,000 per year. It is now $23,000 per year. <a href=\"https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college-by-year?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">College tuition</a> at a state school increased by 8 times over the last 30 years. These <a href=\"https://uvaro.com/blog/college-costs-vs-inflation-1982-present?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">huge cost increases</a> for healthcare, education, and housing are not compatible with the American Dream.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://uvaro.com/blog/college-costs-vs-inflation-1982-present?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/01/image-6.png\" width=\"675\" /></a></figure><p>Programmers all over the world helped make an American Dream happen <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080703183923/http://stackoverflow.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">in 2008</a> when we built <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Stack Overflow</a>, a Q&amp;A website for programmers creating a shared <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Creative Commons</a> knowledge base for the world. We did it democratically, because that&apos;s the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_way?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">American way</a>. We voted to rank questions and answers, and held elections for community moderators using <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked-choice_voting_in_the_United_States?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ranked choice voting</a>. We built a <strong>digital democracy</strong> &#x2013; of the programmers, by the programmers, for the programmers. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/vijaygurbaxani/2021/06/08/the-18-billion-acquisition-of-stack-overflow-aims-to-turbocharge-the-worlds-software-knowhow/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">It worked</a>. <br /><br />With the guidance of my co-founder <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Joel Spolsky</a>, I came to understand that the digital democracy of Stack Overflow was not enough. We must be brave enough to actively, openly share love with each other. That became the foundation for <a href=\"https://discourse.org/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\">Discourse</a>, a free, open source tool for constructive, empathetic community discussions that are also Creative Commons. We can disagree in those discussions because Discourse empowers communities to <a href=\"https://frameshiftconsulting.com/2017/09/10/the-intolerable-speech-rule-the-paradox-of-tolerance-for-tech-companies?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">set boundaries the community agrees on</a>, providing tools to democratically govern and strongly moderate by enforcing these boundaries. <strong>Digital democracy <em>and empathy</em>,</strong> for everyone.</p><p>In order for digital democracy to work, we need to see each other through our screens.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><a href=\"https://xkcd.com/438/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\"><img alt=\"alt\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"253\" src=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2025/01/xkcd438_condensed_b.png\" width=\"382\" /></a></figure><p><a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/they-have-to-be-monsters/\"><u>We often behave online in ways we never would in the real world</u></a> because we cannot see the person on the other side of the screen.

I probably couldn&apos;t have accomplished this in any other country, and I was rewarded handsomely for a combination of hard work and good luck. That&apos;s what the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/American-Dream?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">American Dream</a> promises us. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"></figure><p><a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-field-of-dreams-strategy/\"><u>We built it, and<em> people came</em></u></a>. I earned millions of dollars. I thought that was the final part of the American Dream. But it wasn&apos;t.</p><p>I recently attended a theater performance of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outsiders_(novel)?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\">The Outsiders</a> at my son&apos;s public high school. All I really knew was the famous <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f46JMzVzSB4&amp;ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">&quot;stay gold&quot; line</a> from the 1983 movie adaptation. But as I sat there in the audience among my neighbors, watching the complete story acted out in front of me by these teenagers, I slowly realized what staying gold actually meant: <a href=\"http://blog.asjournal.org/the-american-dream-reconsidered-the-outsiders-1967/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>sharing</em> the American Dream</a>. </p><p>In the printed program, the director wrote:</p><blockquote>This play is a reminder that strength lies not just in overcoming hardships but in staying true to ourselves and lifting up those around us. <br /><br />We hope you feel the raw emotions, sense the camaraderie, and <strong>connect with the enduring themes of resilience, empathy, and unity</strong>. Whether you&apos;ve read this story recently, long ago, or not at all, I hope you are able to find inspiration in the strength and passion of youth. Thank you for being part of this journey with us.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://poets.org/poem/nothing-gold-can-stay?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\">Stay gold</a>.</blockquote><p>I <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/im-loyal-to-nothing-except-the-dream/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">believe deeply</a> in sharing The American Dream. It is the foundation of our country, the second paragraph in our <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Declaration of Independence</a>, written by the founder of the public university I attended:</p><blockquote>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</blockquote><p>But the American Dream is not always available to every American. Its meaning can be distorted. Jimi Hendrix <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/rewinding-jimi-hendrixs-national-anthem?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">captured this distortion</a> so eloquently in his rendition of our national anthem. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"></figure><p>We are still trying to live up to those ideals today.

Why? Is it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression_in_the_United_States?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">voter suppression</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">gerrymandering</a> causing indifference, or people who felt their vote didn&apos;t matter?

Whatever the reasons, 42% of adults living in America had no say in the 2024 election. The vote <a href=\"https://election.lab.ufl.edu/2024-general-election-turnout/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">failed to represent everyone</a>.</p><p>I think many of the Americans who did vote are telling us they no longer believe our government is effectively <em>keeping America fair for everyone</em>. Our status as the <a href=\"https://thefulcrum.us/ethics-leadership/democracy-index?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">world&apos;s leading democracy</a> is in question.

This much wealth starts to unintentionally distance my family from other Americans. I no longer bother to look at how much items cost, because <em>I don&apos;t have to</em>. We don&apos;t have to think about all these things that are challenging or unreachable for so many others. The more wealth you attain, the more unmistakably clear it becomes how unequal life is for so many of us.<br /><br />Even with the wealth I have, I can&apos;t imagine what it would feel like <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/democrats-harris-billionaire-mistake/680779/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">to be a billionaire</a><em>.</em> <strong>It is, for lack of a better word, </strong><a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>unamerican</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"></figure><p>In 2012, the top 1% of Americans held 24% of our country&apos;s wealth.

I am only holding back enough wealth for my children so they can afford college educations and buy a home.
