Most people have never heard of libertarian homesteaders or rationalist dating sites, perhaps you have also never heard of the things most other people belong to.</p><p>For my part, I have been part of a foam combat ('boffer') organization since college. You may want to say 'that's not a community, that's just a hobby', but the people in this sport form a strong community with tight bonds outside the game itself. Not only do I go to practices twice a week, I have 2 D&amp;D games and 1 board game night every week with mostly members of the community, members of the community are my friends that I go out to movies and dinners with, play video games with voice chat on Discord with, talk to online in Discord servers and web forums and group chats, go to parties with and gossip about with other community members. Aside from attending over a dozen weddings of community members (mostly to other community members), I've served as best man for 2 members and wedding officiant for 2 other members. The sport itself has houses, guilds, and fighting units, all with their own ethos, credos, goals, activities, and hierarchies; it has knighthoods and squireships, it has awards for arts and crafts and community service. The sport has regular camping events that end up looking like temporary compounds of hundreds to thousand+ members, lasting from a weekend to a week. We may not have a singular God or Invisible Hand we all worship, but we have strong community norms towards things like inclusion, creating positive experiences, some modernized gender-neutral version of chivalry, creating safe spaces, etc.</p><p>If you didn't know me very very well, you might know that 'oh yeah, he does some kind of sword fighting thing on the weekends I think?', and not know there's a large and strong community there.</p><p>I wonder how many other things are like this - I think 'oh yeah, they play softball on the weekends, oh yeah, they belong to a knitting circle, oh yeah, they go to a lot of concerts, oh yeah, they volunteer at some kind of community center', and have no idea that there's a strong close-knit community surrounding those things that remains largely invisible to outsiders.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Logan (<a href=\"https://lbryck.substack.com\">blog</a>) <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/should-strong-gods-bet-on-gdp/comment/142478012\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>As another commenter (darwin) said, I think Scott is underestimating how many people are in ~5/10 \"weird\" intentional communities, comparable to rationalism. Rationalism is just more salient to him, because he's in it. A lot of 5/10 weird intentional communities are pretty invisible to people outside of them.</p><p>FIRE (as in Financial Independence/Retire Early) in particular comes to mind as another weird community that absolutely corresponds with his thesis of affluence enabling more niche community-building. FIRE people have online forums and meetups, and groups of them do things like buy up most of a block of houses to take over a neighborhood in a small town in Colorado. It's way easier for everybody to go to a community meetup in the desert for a week or two if they're affluent. That applies to a FIRE meetup I went to in the desert in Utah, and also calls Burning Man to mind. Tons of people just draw the line of weirdness at a place where they can blend into \"normal\" liberal society.</p><p>So a 9/10 weird cult is a really different place to draw the line, but it's really quite normal to be in a 5/10 weird community, almost certainly not only 10% like Scott estimates. And since \"weirdness\" is defined by what gets ostracized, it's notable that the communities we define as the most weird are the most illiberal - conservative/orthodox religious sects. Illiberalism is \"weird\" in a liberal society because illiberalism is definitionally the one thing that liberalism openly ostracizes.</p></blockquote><p>I appreciate the FIRE example - if they&#8217;re taking over parts of neighborhoods, they at least get a 5/10 on my scale.</p><p>Still, I will defend the claim that less than 10% of the population belongs to groups like this; I think commenters overestimate how many people don&#8217;t have any cool hobbies or unique groups that they&#8217;re part of. If 50K people are that seriously into FIRE, and there are a thousand communities of that size, and there&#8217;s 50% overlap (e.g. someone who&#8217;s both into FIRE and a Mormon), then that&#8217;s still consistent with less than 10%!</p><p><strong>Mutton Dressed As Mutton <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/should-strong-gods-bet-on-gdp/comment/142389812\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I think the problem with the material abundance version of tight-knit community is that most people don't really want tight-knit community. They want the benefits but not the downsides.</p><p>The downsides are both real and unfortunately deeply and inextricably linked to the benefits. You can maybe buy your way out of some of the downsides, but at some point you have to accept the package. You can imagine a kibbutz that is less insane, but a kibbutz that is just a chill place where people do their own thing is not a kibbutz. Most people don't want the full kibbutz.</p><p>Cartoons Hate Her makes this point better and at length: <a href=\"https://www.cartoonshateher.com/p/the-village-nobody-wants\">The Village Nobody Wants</a>.</p><p>Groups like the Amish (and Hasidic Jews, etc.) achieve community by raising the costs of leaving so high that most members aren't willing to bear them. Some do, and the stories are often quite sad (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-Who-Go-Not-Return/dp/1555977057/\">https://www.amazon.com/All-Who-Go-Not-Return/dp/1555977057/</a>). Even less insular communities, like the Mormons, do something like this (although mainstream Mormons could be regarded as striking a fairly successful balance).</p><p>I suspect rationalist enclaves are long-term unstable like most intentional communities. They aren't actually drafting on wealth, they are just huffing ideology and will eventually implode or explode. I've had some limited exposure to deeply rationalist subcultures, and what I mainly observed was that they were extremely weird. I say that, sincerely, without judgment -- it's fine to be weird, even good in many ways -- but weirdness doesn't seem like enough to hang a community on. The moment will pass, people will move on.</p></blockquote><p>I think it&#8217;s worth distinguishing among four strategies for community:</p><ol><li><p><strong>The medieval peasant strategy:</strong> you are stuck in a tiny village for your whole life, guess you&#8217;ve got community whether you like it or not.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Orthodox Jewish strategy:</strong> try to replicate the medieval peasant strategy within a large modern society by starting with an ethnicity/religion and having very high barriers to exit. </p></li><li><p><strong>The Cartoons Hate Her strategy:</strong> try to get random people close to you to form a community - but they might not find it very engaging and it might never start to begin with.</p></li><li><p><strong>The liberal (eg rationalist / libertarian / foam boffer / LGBTQ / FIRE) strategy</strong>: try to gather a particular type of person together into a &#8220;natural&#8221; community that feels intuitive and low-effort because members are doing things they believe in (or enjoy) with people who are deeply similar to them. Here the &#8220;barrier to exit&#8221; is that the community is already optimized for your preferences and you would be less happy outside of it.</p></li></ol><p>I claim that the first two work better in conditions of poverty (because they&#8217;re based on barriers to exit), the third works only sporadically and doesn&#8217;t scale, and the fourth works better in conditions of affluence (because it requires people to sort themselves, which might mean choosing where to live based for community rather than financial reasons).</p><p><strong>Ariel (<a href=\"https://www.zappable.com/\">blog</a>) <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/should-strong-gods-bet-on-gdp/comment/142384027\">writes</a>: </strong></p><blockquote><p>Just because something is valuable, that doesn't mean people will put in the effort to achieve it. Even putting aside monetary issues, it's a huge effort to build a community, and people won't necessarily go ahead and do it. An advantage of religion (and maybe the techo-rationalist space) is that they provide natural conditions for building a community.</p></blockquote><p>But shouldn&#8217;t this problem be a good match for entrepreneurial capitalism? If it&#8217;s possible to create a community better than regular society, can&#8217;t someone do it, charge a membership fee, and get rich?</p><p><strong>DangerouslyUnstable <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/should-strong-gods-bet-on-gdp/comment/142415850\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I think the problem with this idea is that: when there isn't a single default strong community, most people do the lazy thing and choose not to participate. I think that no matter how rich people got, most people would never be part of a strong community because being part of a strong community takes effort. I think this is why, despite living in the richest nation in the history of the planet, we have some of the weakest/least amount of strong communities, which is why I find your comment that more money = more community strange. Yes, for people who care, having money makes it easier. But all of western civilization is proof that more money does not, in general, equal more community.</p><p>If you make community opt-in, as liberalism does (and to be very clear, I'm pro liberalism), most people will not go to the effort of opting in. Almost everyone in the US is rich enough that, if they wanted, they could be part of a strong community. They are just uninterested in the effort that would take.</p></blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t think &#8220;effort&#8221; is the exact right way of looking at this.</p><p>Compare this to some sort of impressive athletic accomplishment - let&#8217;s say being able to lift 300 lbs. If I wanted to be able to lift 300 lbs, this would be <em>effortful</em>, but not <em>complicated</em>. I would Google &#8220;good gym routine&#8221;, find a gym near me, go a couple times a week, gradually ramp up, and eventually achieve my goal.</p><p>If I wanted to be in a very strong community, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any way to <em>just</em> &#8220;expend effort&#8221; and make it happen. Maybe I could learn Hebrew and convert to Orthodox Judaism, but there are lots of reasons not to do that besides just laziness (plus one extra reason for people who aren&#8217;t already circumcised!) If I wanted a community of the &#8220;ten normal-ish families on a suburban block raising children together&#8221; variety, this seems about as tough as founding a new company, in the sense that you need to be creative, agentic, and willing to risk everything falling apart.</p><p>This is what I mean by &#8220;this space needs entrepreneurs&#8221;. If I want a Ferrari, it&#8217;s going to be <em>expensive</em>, but not <em>complicated</em>. Once there are expensive and effortful, but not complicated, ways to get a good community, I&#8217;ll be more willing to believe that effort is the barrier.</p><p><strong>Justin <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/should-strong-gods-bet-on-gdp/comment/142891625\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>The example of the Mormons is a good one, but in more ways than &#8220;get lots of people of the same religion together in one place&#8221;. That model was certainly true of the early church, but the real innovation of modern Mormonism is exporting the same community-building model to all four corners of the earth. A common experience for Latter-day Saints traveling abroad is to be struck by how nearly identical the Sunday experience is whether in Africa, America, or Asia. The upshot of the Church&#8217;s system of social organization is that it is effortless for a Latter-day Saint person to slot into a new community wherever they go, and it is likewise easy for the community to sustain itself as individuals naturally come and go while they pursue their secular lives and careers. That kind of physical location independence goes a long way towards solving the practical problems highlighted in the post.</p></blockquote><p>Maybe the Mormons are the entrepreneurs we&#8217;re looking for?</p><p></p><h2>Comments About Specific Communities</h2><p><strong>Ebrima Lelisa writes:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I doubt the conclusion of this post.</p><p>I've visited an Indian friend in rural Pennsylvania. Their housing community is 98% Indian. There's only 1 non-Indian family out of the 50 houses.</p><p>Close to where I live there's an apartment block which is 80% Indian, especially students.</p><p>If money is an issue or anti-discrimination laws then how do these communities form?</p></blockquote><p>Great point! And I agree Indians are the best example - too new to piggyback off older communities like Chinatowns, and usually rich enough that their proximity can&#8217;t be dismissed as ghettoization. I don&#8217;t really have a great explanation for this; maybe it just proves that if you&#8217;re committed enough you can still make it work.</p><p><strong>Hilarius Bookbinder (<a href=\"https://hilariusbookbinder.substack.com/\">blog</a>) <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/should-strong-gods-bet-on-gdp/comment/142381739\">writes</a>:</strong> </p><blockquote><p><em>&#187; &#8220;Why don&#8217;t conservatives live in trad whites-only farming villages on the Great Plains?&#8221; </em></p><p>There seems to be a movement in exactly that direction: <a href=\"https://www.returntotheland.org/about\">https://www.returntotheland.org/about</a></p></blockquote><p>Their site says &#8220;Return to the Land is a private membership association (PMA) for individuals and families with traditional views and common continental ancestry. We hold events and conferences, and we help groups of our members form European heritage communities&#8230;We will return to the land to separate ourselves from a failing modern society, and we will make positive cultural changes in ourselves and in our ancestral communities&#8221; - so yeah, that sure is a movement towards trad whites-only farming villages.</p><p>Their first test community has bought land in Arkansas, and there are a few articles on it, including <a href=\"https://ca.news.yahoo.com/internet-completely-stunned-whites-only-153211608.html\">this one</a> which describes it as &#8220;about 40 inhabitants who live on 150 acres of land [with] cabins, roads, wells, a community center, and a schoolhouse&#8221;, and <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/inside-the-whites-only-settlement-in-arkansas-the-group-building-a-fortress-for-the-white-race-13399875\">this </a>interview with movement leader Eric Orwoll, who says that &#8220;a second Hitler won&#8217;t arrive unless people do the work&#8221;, but that &#8220;when I say, you're gonna have to wait for that new Hitler to arise, I'm not saying you're going to have to wait for a new person to start a new Holocaust.

How Orwollian. </p><p>Richard Hanania has <a href=\"https://www.richardhanania.com/p/no-to-borders-yes-to-allowing-whites\">an article supporting the movement here</a>, as part of a galaxy-brained defense of open borders. His argument is that you have no right to keep foreigners out of &#8220;your&#8221; country, but that if you want a foreigner-free community you can always form some enclave on private property like these people are doing. I appreciate the proceduralism - but suppose that enough current Americans wanted a non-open-borders community that they figured out ways to purchase most of the United States, turn it into a community like this, and institute some sort of democratic governance for it. Wouldn&#8217;t that just be recreating the current situation of an America where most people don&#8217;t want open borders and so we don&#8217;t have them, but with extra steps? If so, why mandate the extra steps?</p><p><strong>Yosef <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/should-strong-gods-bet-on-gdp/comment/142383616\">writes</a>: </strong></p><blockquote><p>You forgot ultra-orthodox Jews.

For instance, some sects don't believe in smoke detectors, so none of their buildings are compliant with fire codes. Each community has one smoke detector stashed away somewhere, and when they construct a new building, they stick it in an appropriate place until the inspection is done, then take it down and put it away. (Or, that's the rumor.)</p><p>It's the same with sewage rules, egress requirements, etc. Many of which are ridiculous for structures that don't have electricity or running water. But it's still illegal to violate ridiculous laws.</p><p>In many places they've succeeded in negotiating carve-outs for their settlements in local building codes. But in others, officials just turn a blind eye, or else it's a source of constant conflict.</p><p>Roughly all of the examples of intentional community Scott points to are (technically) illegal in one way or another. Education, child welfare, zoning, public accommodation laws, animal welfare, discrimination, public health, child labor laws, etc.</p><p>Mostly, in the US, as long as everyone involved consents, you can get away with breaking these kinds of laws. But if you become A Problem, or if somebody complains about you, your situation can become quite tenuous. The Amish have had to go all the way to the Supreme Court as recently as 2021 (to avoid installing septic tanks for their graywater).</p></blockquote><p>Granted that this is true for the Amish. I&#8217;m less sure it matters for the average community, for whom the level of smoke detectors in buildings isn&#8217;t a big issue.</p><p>Still, many people tried to argue that government repression was a major block on community creation. One reader mentioned <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPIC_City,_Texas\">EPIC City, Texas</a>, a proposed Muslim community which was being fought by anti-Muslim conservatives who accused it of wanting &#8220;sharia law&#8221; (organizers countered that it was just going to be a neighborhood around a mosque, without any special legal carveout). Other people brought up the way housing discrimination law bars most forms of choosing who you live with, making it hard to have an Xs-only neighborhood.</p><p>I am mostly skeptical of how much this matters because of how many groups manage to have communities anyway, but some readers tried to argue there were specific stories for how each of them escaped the problem (either getting grandfathered in, like the Amish, or being sufficiently-liked-by-leftists to escape anti-discrimination law, like various immigrant groups)</p><p></p><h2>Other Comments</h2><p><strong>Notmy Realname <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/should-strong-gods-bet-on-gdp/comment/142387640\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I wouldn't consider bay area rationalists a bona fide Community, just a social club, until you demonstrate enough sticking power to grow your community in perpetuity. Every other Community you mentioned (besides the libertarians who I also don't count) have a relatively low churn rate and enough growth to keep up with it. Are you confident that you'll be able to continue pulling in new members a decade from now? Do you think your kids will turn apostate?</p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;m sort of confident? We haven&#8217;t gone through a full generational turnover yet, but the first cadre of people who got involved in the late-2000s (eg me) are in their forties now, and we still have new twenty-year-old college students joining each year. Around 2022, when the rest of the world realized that AI would be important, I worried we would lose our distinctiveness. But the rest of the world has dropped the ball as usual - the stochastic parrot folks most obviously, but even the average person who talks about &#8220;superintelligence&#8221; these days just seems to imagine ChatGPT getting extra-good and making OpenAI extra-rich. So I&#8217;ve updated towards thinking we have some edge which is hard to replicate.</p><p>But I also don&#8217;t think this matters too much for my broader point. A liberal society of constantly shifting strong communities, each of which only lasts one to two generations, would be perfectly fine, as long as there are new ones springing up to replace the old. There would be something sad about your kids probably being in a different community from you, but in many cases that&#8217;s already a given (the average LGBT person knows there&#8217;s a strong chance any children they have will grow up to be straight) and maybe it&#8217;s ultimately for the better (if there was a 99% chance that rationalists&#8217; children would stay in the rationalist community, I would worry we were doing some sort of brainwashing - if instead they get really into FIRE and find a community there, maybe that&#8217;s a best-case scenario).</p><p><strong>Walruss (<a href=\"https://walruss10.substack.com/?utm_content=comment_metadata&amp;utm_source=substack-feed-item\">blog</a>) <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/should-strong-gods-bet-on-gdp/comment/142386184\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>This is missing something unique about this moment in history, and I'm super skeptical of arguments that start with \"this is missing something unique about this moment in history.\"</p><p>The past 3 generations have been defined by absurd abundance.

The book The Upswing by Putnam is incredibly important as a historical social science grounding for debates around weakening communities. Most of these debates assume a monotonic decrease in community (which also seems to be happening here), but The Upswing takes great pains to note all the ways that in the first half of the 20th century, all the indicators of strong communities in America were going UP.</p><p>We ended the Gilded Age fractured and alone, and built up civic associational life, communitarian ideals, etc. from around 1900 to around 1960, after which all those indicators start plunging in all the charts you see everywhere today. But because we have been so focused on the last 60-odd years of data, we have missed the incredibly important context of the (titular) upswing that occurred in the first half of the 20th century in America and didn't require populism (in fact, the Populist movement in America was strongest right BEFORE the upswing began, ~1870-1900), and it was the Progressives that kicked off associational, communitarian ideals. This increase in community and togetherness was a strong trend through the Great Depression, the New Deal, and the Postwar years. It wasn't costless! There were reasons people rebelled against the reigning order in the 1960s and 1970s. But every solution creates its own problems, and I think making this about Modernity and not about the last 65 years of culture obscures the contours of the issue.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Shaun Willden writes:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I think the core challenge to rich, liberal would-be communities is that true community is built upon serving one another, on deep interdependence.</p><p>Real interdependence is naturally achieved by groups of poor villagers who all must work together to survive.

                "<p>A key problem with having and interpreting reactions to GPT-5 is that it is often unclear whether the reaction is to GPT-5, GPT-5-Router or GPT-5-Thinking.</p>\n<p>Another is that many of the things people are reacting to changed rapidly after release, such as rate limits, the effectiveness of the model selection router and alternative options, and the availability of GPT-4o.</p>\n<p>This complicates the tradition I have in new AI model reviews, which is to organize and present various representative and noteworthy reactions to the new model, to give a sense of what people are thinking and the diversity of opinion.</p>\n<p>I also had make more cuts than usual, since there were so many eyes on this one. I tried to keep proportions similar to the original sample as best I could.</p>\n<div>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-24645\"></span>\n\n\n</div>\n<p>Reactions are organized roughly in order from positive to negative, with the drama around GPT-4o at the end.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow I will put it all together, cover the official hype and presentation and go over GPT-5\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and how I\u2019ve found it is best to use it after having the better part of a week to try things out, as well as what this means for expectations and timelines.</p>\n<p>My overall impression of GPT-5 continues to be that it is a good (but not great) set of models, with GPT-5-Thinking and GPT-5-Pro being substantial upgrades over o3 and o3-Pro, but the launch was botched, and reactions are confused, because among other things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The name GPT-5 and all the hype led to great expectations and underdelivery.</li>\n<li>All the different models were launched at once when they\u2019re actually different.</li>\n<li>GPT-4o and other models were taken away without warning,</li>\n<li>GPT-5 baseline personality is off putting to a lot of people right now and it isn\u2019t noticeably more intelligent than GPT-4o was on typical normal person usage.</li>\n<li>Severe temporary limits were imposed that people thought would be permanent.</li>\n<li>The router was broken, and even when not broken doesn\u2019t work great.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I expect that when the dust settles people will be happy and GPT-5 will do well, even if it is not what we might have hoped for from an AI called GPT-5.</p>\n<p>Previously on GPT-5: <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/gpt-5s-are-alive-basic-facts-benchmarks\"><strong>GPT-5s Are Alive: Basic Facts, Benchmarks and Model Card</strong></a></p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tyler Cowen</h4>\n\n\n<p>Tyler Cowen finds it great at answering the important questions.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/08/gpt-5-short-and-enthusiastic-review.html\">Tyler Cowen</a>: <strong>GPT-5, a short and enthusiastic review</strong></p>\n<p>I am a big fan, as on my topics of interest it does much better than o3, and that is saying something. It is also lightning fast, even for complex queries of economics, history, and ideas.</p>\n<p>One of the most impressive features is its uncanny sense of what you might want to ask next. And it has a good sense of when to give you an (sometimes interactive!) chart or diagram.</p>\n<p>I have had early access, and love to just keep on asking it, asking it, asking it questions. Today I was asking about Irish coinage disputes from 1724 (Swift) and now about different kinds of Buddhism and their historical roots. It was very accurate on cuisine in northern Ghana.</p>\n<p>It is the best learning tool I have. Furthermore, it <em>feels</em> fun.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Tyler Cowen has been a big booster of o1, o3 and now GPT-5. What OpenAI has been cooking clearly matches what he has been seeking.</p>\n<p>I appreciate that he isn\u2019t trying to give a universal recommendation or make a grand claim. He\u2019s saying that for his topics and needs and experiences, this is a big upgrade.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ethan Mollick Thinks Ease Of Use Is A Big Deal</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/emollick/status/1953502029126549597\">Ethan Mollick</a>: I had access to GPT-5. <a href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/gpt-5-it-just-does-stuff?triedRedirect=true\">I think it is a very big deal as it is very smart &amp; just does stuff for you</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Okay, why is it a big deal?</p>\n<blockquote><p>As someone who has spent a lot of time talking to people about AI, there are two major problems I see, that, if addressed, would make most people\u2019s AI use much more productive and much less frustrating.</p>\n<p>The first is selecting the right model to use.</p>\n<p>A surprising number of people have never seen what AI can actually do because they&#8217;re stuck on GPT-4o, and don\u2019t know which of the confusingly-named models are better. GPT-5 does away with this by selecting models for you, automatically.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I agree this is frustrating, and that those who don\u2019t know how to select models and modes are at a disadvantage. Does GPT-5 solve this?</p>\n<p>Somewhat. It solves two important subproblems, largely for those who think \u2018AI\u2019 and \u2018ChatGPT\u2019 are the same picture.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Users who previously only used GPT-4o and didn\u2019t know there was a dropdown menu will now get the GPT-5-Thinking when their queries justify it.</li>\n<li>Users no longer have to deal with a set of OpenAI models that includes GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.5, o3, o3-Pro, o4-mini and so on. We can all agree this is a mess.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What it doesn\u2019t do is solve the problem overall, for three reasons.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Router</h4>\n\n\n<p>The first is that the router seems okay but not great, and there is randomness involved.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ethan Mollick: But for people who use AI more seriously, there is an issue: GPT-5 is somewhat arbitrary about deciding what a hard problem is.</p>\n<p>\u2026around 2/3 of the time, GPT-5 decides this is an easy problem.</p>\n<p>But premium subscribers can directly select the more powerful models, such as the one called (at least for me) GPT-5 Thinking.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ansonwhitmer/status/1954641153078476828\">Anson Whitmer</a>: Feels like it picks between 4.2o and o3.1.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was quite relieved to know I could do manual selection. But that very much means that I still have to think, before each query, whether to use Thinking, the exact same way I used to think about whether to use o3, and also whether to use pro. No change.</p>\n<p>They also claim that saying \u2018think harder\u2019 automatically triggers thinking mode.</p>\n<p>The mixture of experts that I can\u2019t steer and that calls the wrong one for me often enough that I manually select the expert? It is not helping matters.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/shakoistsLog/status/1953858644896100451\">Shako</a>: I realize the OpenAI product shouldn&#8217;t be made for weird super-users like me. But I really liked choosing between o3 and 4.5 depending on if i wanted autistic problem solving or sensitive young man discussions.</p>\n<p>One for coding, one for analyzing lana del rey songs. I don&#8217;t want the same model for both.</p>\n<p>I also feel like I can&#8217;t really evaluate gpt5? What is gpt5? what is the underlying router? I&#8217;m so confused.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/robeardius/status/1954002692021661829\">Robeardius</a>: so tired of listening to basic broke mcdonalds meal tier subscribers complain sub to pro or shut up. you don&#8217;t pay for the cost of what you use anyway.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-uHL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d9b5fa4-4292-468b-ae4f-74d4443fb7f5_429x524.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/internetope/status/1954561787224801317\">internetperson</a>: GPT-5 non-thinking is bad, maybe at-or-slightly-below 4o.</p>\n<p>GPT-5-thinking is an upgrade from o3. Feels about equally-as-intelligent while not being an evil liar.</p>\n<p>The model router was a total mistake, and just means I have to pick thinking for everything.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/TateLTower/status/1954557279732191443\">Take Tower</a>: It wants to be a good model but the router problems get in the way.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I do not think, contra Sichu Lu, that it is <a href=\"https://x.com/lu_sichu/status/1954213100468437503\">as simple as \u2018profile the customer and learn which ones want intelligence versus who wants a friend</a>, although some amount of that is a good idea on the margin. It should jump to thinking mode a lot quicker for me than for most users.</p>\n<p>The second issue is that the router does not actually route to all my options even within ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>There are two very important others: Agent Mode and Deep Research.</p>\n<p>Again, before I ask ChatGPT to do anything for me, I need to think about whether to use Agent Mode or Deep Research.</p>\n<p>And again, many ChatGPT users won\u2019t know these options exist. They miss out again.</p>\n<p>Third, OpenAI wishes it were otherwise but there are other AIs and ways to use AI out there.</p>\n<p>If you want to know how to get best use of AI, your toolkit starts with at minimum all of the big three: Yes ChatGPT, but also <a href=\"https://claude.ai/new\">Anthropic\u2019s Claude</a> and Google\u2019s Gemini. Then there are things like Claude Code, CLI or Jules, or NotebookLM and Google AI Studio and so on, many with their own modes. The problem doesn\u2019t go away.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Remember To Use Thinking Mode</h4>\n\n\n<p>Many report that all the alpha is in GPT-5-Thinking and Pro, and that using \u2018regular\u2019 GPT-5 is largely a trap for all but very basic tasks.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1954068588014580072\">OpenAI</a> (August 9): A few GPT-5 updates heading into the weekend:</p>\n<p>&#8211; GPT-5 thinking and GPT-5 pro now in main model picker</p>\n<p>By popular request, you can now check which model ran your prompt by hovering over the \u201cRegen\u201d menu.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Taelin is happy with what he sees from GPT-5-Thinking.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/VictorTaelin/status/1953603500304376289\">Taelin</a>: Nah you&#8217;re all wrong, GPT-5 is a leap. I&#8217;m 100% doubling down here.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t want to post too fast and regret it again, but it just solved a bunch of very, very hard debugging prompts that were previously unsolved (by AI), and then designed a gorgeous pixelated Gameboy game with a level of detail and quality that is clearly beyond anything else I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>\n<p>There is no way this model is bad.</p>\n<p>I think you&#8217;re all traumatized of benchmaxxers, and over-compensating against a model that is actually good. I also think you&#8217;re underestimating gpt-oss&#8217;s strengths (but yeah my last post was rushed)</p>\n<p>I still don&#8217;t know if it is usable for serious programming though (o3 wasn&#8217;t), but it seems so? A coding model as reliable as Opus, yet smarter than o3, would completely change my workflow. Opus doesn&#8217;t need thinking to be great though, so, that might weight in its favor.</p>\n<p>For what it is worth, I only really used 3 models:</p>\n<p>&#8211; Opus 4.1 for coding</p>\n<p>&#8211; Gemini 2.5 very rarely for coding when Opus fails</p>\n<p>&#8211; o3 for everything but coding</p>\n<p>That said, ASCII not solved yet.</p>\n<p>GPT-5 basically one-shot this [a remarkably featured pokemon-style game].</p>\n<p>Also GPT-5 is the second model to successfully implement a generic fold for \u03bb-Calculus N-Tuples (after Gemini Pro 2.5 Deep Think), and its solution is smaller! Oh, I just noticed GPT-5&#8217;s solution is identical to mine. This is incredible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/VictorTaelin/status/1953788955012304915\">BTW, GPT-5 is basically as bad as GPT-4o always was</a>. GPT-5-Thinking is probably o4, as I predicted, and that one is good.</p>\n<p>GPT-5-Thinking is probably o4, as I predicted, and that one is good.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/DanielleFong/status/1954395330021405082\">Danielle Fong</a>: can confirm that gpt-5-thinking is quite good.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/intellectronica/status/1954557894789149150\">Eleanor Berger</a>: Thinking model is excellent. Almost certainly the best AI currently available. Amazing for coding, for writing, for complex problems, for search and tool use. Whatever it is you get in the app when you choose the non-thinking model is weirdly bad &#8211; likely routing to a mini model.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The problem is that GPT-5-Thinking does not know when to go quick because that\u2019s what the switch is for.</p>\n<p>So because OpenAI tried to do the switching for you, you end up having to think about every choice, whereas before you could just use o3 and it was fine.</p>\n<p>This all reminds me of the tale of Master of Orion 3, which was supposed to be an epic game where you only got 7 move points a turn and they made everything impossible to micromanage, so you\u2019d have to use their automated systems, then players complained so they took away the 7 point restriction and then everyone had to micromanage everything that was designed to make that terrible. Whoops.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/gallabytes/status/1954379977274912835\">Gallabytes</a>: gpt5 thinking is good but way too slow even for easy things. gpt5 not thinking is not very good. need gpt5-thinking-low.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/build__fast/status/1954601844770328995\">Richard Knoche:</a> claude is better+than gpt5 and gpt5 thinking is way too slow compared to claude</p></blockquote>\n<p>A lot of the negative reactions could plausibly be \u2018they used the wrong version, sir.\u2019</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/emollick/status/1954210778321465634\">Ethan Mollick</a>: The issue with GPT-5 in a nutshell is that unless you pay for model switching &amp; know to use GPT-5 Thinking or Pro, when you ask \u201cGPT-5\u201d you sometimes get the best available AI &amp; sometimes get one of the worst AIs available and it might even switch within a single conversation.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WBlo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd24bd1b2-b7c1-4da2-8c18-8da009718348_1199x521.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even if they \u2018fix\u2019 this somewhat the choice is clear: Use the explicit model switcher.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/sdmat123/status/1953635701029056550\">Similarly, if you\u2019re using Codex CLI</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/lisperati/status/1954561944486342780\">Conrad Barski</a>: codex cli with gpt5 isn&#8217;t impressing- Not a good sign that I feel compelled to write &#8220;think hard&#8221; at the end of every request</p>\n<p>gpt5 pro seems good so far and feels like sota on coding, though I need to do more testing</p>\n<p>Sdmat: For anyone trying GPT-5 in Codex CLI and wanting to set reasoning effort this is how to do it:</p>\n<p>codex -c model_reasoning_effort=&#8221;high&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The One Who Does Not Know How To Ask</h4>\n\n\n<p>Getting back to Ethan Mollick\u2019s other noted feature, that I don\u2019t see others noticing:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ethan Mollick: The second most common problem with AI use, which is that many people don\u2019t know what AIs can do, or even what tasks they want accomplished.</p>\n<p>That is especially true of the new agentic AIs, which can take a wide range of actions to accomplish the goals you give it, from searching the web to creating documents. But what should you ask for? A lot of people seem stumped. Again, GPT-5 solves this problem. It is very proactive, always suggesting things to do.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Is that\u2026 good?</p>\n<blockquote><p>I asked GPT-5 Thinking (I trust the less powerful GPT-5 models much less) \u201cgenerate 10 startup ideas for a former business school entrepreneurship professor to launch, pick the best according to some rubric, figure out what I need to do to win, do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>I got the business idea I asked for.</p>\n<p>I also got a whole bunch of things I did not: drafts of landing pages and LinkedIn copy and simple financials and a lot more.</p>\n<p>I am a professor who has taught entrepreneurship (and been an entrepreneur) and I can say confidently that, while not perfect, this was a high-quality start that would have taken a team of MBAs a couple hours to work through. From one prompt.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!j7w1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdad50315-f6b5-45e1-a275-1427f3a4fabd_1812x1631.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, that was work that would have taken humans a bunch of time, and I trust Ethan\u2019s assessment that it was a good version of that work. But why should we think that was work that Ethan wanted or would find useful?</p>\n<blockquote><p>It just does things, and it suggested others things to do. And it did those, too: PDFs and Word documents and Excel and research plans and websites.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I guess if stuff is sufficiently fast and cheap to do there\u2019s no reason to not go ahead and do it? And yes, everyone appreciates the (human) assistant who is proactive and goes that extra mile, but not the one that spends tons of time on that without a strong intuition of what you actually want.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Let me show you what &#8216;just doing stuff&#8217; looks like for a non-coder using GPT-5 for coding. For fun, I prompted GPT-5 \u201cmake a procedural brutalist building creator where i can drag and edit buildings in cool ways, they should look like actual buildings, think hard.\u201d That&#8217;s it. Vague, grammatically questionable, no specifications.</p>\n<p>A couple minutes later, I had a working 3D city builder.</p>\n<p>Not a sketch. Not a plan. A functioning app where I could drag buildings around and edit them as needed. I kept typing variations of \u201cmake it better\u201d without any additional guidance. And GPT-5 kept adding features I never asked for: neon lights, cars driving through streets, facade editing, pre-set building types, dramatic camera angles, a whole save system.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I mean, okay, although I don\u2019t think this functionality is new? The main thing Ethan says is different is that GPT-5 didn\u2019t fail in a growing cascade of errors, and that when it did find errors pasting in the error text fixed it. That\u2019s great but also a very different type of improvement.</p>\n<p>Is it cool that GPT-5 will suggest and do things with fewer human request steps? I mean, I guess for some people, especially <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/09/07/the-four-children-of-the-seder-as-the-simulacra-levels/\">the fourth child who does not know how to ask</a>, and operate so purely on vibes that you can\u2019t come up with the idea of typing in \u2018what are options for next steps\u2019 or \u2018what would I do next?\u2019 or \u2018go ahead and also do or suggest next steps afterwards\u2019 then that\u2019s a substantial improvement. But what if you are the simple, wicked or wise child?</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nabeel Qureshi</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/nabeelqu/status/1953842553159131546\">Nabeel Qureshi</a>: Ok, collecting my overall GPT-5 impressions:</p>\n<p>&#8211; Biggest upgrade seems to be 4o -&gt; 5. I rarely use these models but for the median user this is a huge upgrade.</p>\n<p>&#8211; 5-T is sometimes better than o3, sometimes worse. Finding that I often do side by side queries here, which is annoying. o3 seems to search deeper and more thoroughly at times. o3 is also _weirder_ / more of an autist which I like personally.</p>\n<p>&#8211; 5-pro is really really smart, clearly &#8220;the smartest model on the market&#8221; for complex questions. I need to spend more time testing here, but so far it&#8217;s produced better results than o3 pro.</p>\n<p>&#8211; I spent a few hours in Cursor/GPT5 last night and was super impressed. The model really flies, the instruction following + tool calling is noticeably better, and it&#8217;s more reliable overall. You still need to use all the usual AI coding guardrails to get a good result, but it feels roughly as good as Claude Code / Sonnet now in capability terms, and it is actually better at doing more complex UIs / front-end from what I can tell so far.</p>\n<p>&#8211; CC still feels like a better overall product than Codex to me at the moment, but I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll catch up.</p>\n<p>&#8211; They seem to have souped up GPT5-T&#8217;s fiction writing abilities. I got some interesting/novel stuff out of it for the first time, which is new. (Will post an example in the reply tweets).</p>\n<p>&#8211; I find the UX to get to GPT5-T / Pro annoying (a sub-menu? really?) and wish it were just a toggle. Hopefully this is an easy fix.</p>\n<p>Overall:</p>\n<p>&#8211; Very happy as a Pro user, but I can see why Plus users might complain about the model router. ChatGPT continues to be to be my main go-to for most AI uses.</p>\n<p>&#8211; I don&#8217;t see the &#8220;plateau&#8221; point at all and I think people are overreacting too quickly. Plenty of time to expand along the tool-calling/agent frontier, for one thing. (It&#8217;s easiest to see this when you&#8217;re coding, perhaps, since that&#8217;s where the biggest improvement seems to have come.)</p>\n<p>&#8211; I expect OpenAI will do very well out of this release and their numbers will continue to go up. As they should.</p>\n<p>On creative writing, I asked it to do a para about getting a cold brew in Joyce&#8217;s Finnegans Wake style and was impressed with the below pastiche. For a post-trained model there&#8217;s a lot more novelty/creativity going on than usual (e.g. &#8220;taxicoal black&#8221; for coffee was funny)</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other Positive Reactions</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/SamuelAlbanie/status/1954612968232210705\">Samuel Albanie</a> (Google DeepMind): It&#8217;s fast.
