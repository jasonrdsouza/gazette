Needless to say, the phone call did not go well. What follows is a recap of the conversation where I just shot down the idea and wrapped up the call early because it&apos;s a bad idea.</p><blockquote>If anyone pitches you on the idea that you can achieve secure code generation via an MCP tool or Cursor rules, run, don&apos;t walk.</blockquote><p>Over the last nine months, I&apos;ve written about the changes that are coming to our industry, where we&apos;re entering an arena where most of the code going forward is not going to be written by hand, but instead by agents.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card kg-card-hascaption\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://ghuntley.com/six-month-recap/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">the six-month recap: closing talk on AI at Web Directions, Melbourne, June 2025</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Welcome back to our final session at WebDirections. We&#x2019;re definitely on the glide path&#x2014;though I&#x2019;m not sure if we&#x2019;re smoothly landing, about to hit turbulence, or perhaps facing a go-around. We&#x2019;ll see how it unfolds.

I&apos;ve generated, read, and reviewed a lot of code, and I think perhaps within the next year, the large swaths of code in business will no longer be artisanal hand-crafted. Those days are fast coming to a close.</p><p>Thus, naturally, there is a question that&apos;s on everyone&apos;s mind:</p><blockquote>How do I make the agent generate secure code?</blockquote><p>Let&apos;s start with what you should not do and build up from first principles. </p><!--members-only--><p>The first principle to understand when dealing with LLMs is determinism vs non-determinism. Security is one of those domains in our industry that requires a high level of determinism.  </p><blockquote>A lock is either locked or unlocked. Code is either secure or not secure. There is no shade of grey in this topic.</blockquote><p>If you think that you can achieve security through offering guidance to the LLM through cursor rules, then you are misguided.  Cursor rules or any of those types of rules (i.e AGENTS.md) that are attached to your agentic coding harness are mere suggestions to the LLM. <strong>They are suggestions.</strong> </p><p>It is non-deterministic. It is not security. It is an anti-pattern.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card kg-card-hascaption\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://ghuntley.com/stdlib/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">You are using Cursor AI incorrectly...</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">&#x1f5de;&#xfe0f;I recently shipped a follow-up blog post to this one; this post remains true.

MCP is a function with a prompt that provides <strong>suggestions </strong>to the LLM that the function should be invoked (tool called).</p><p>If you look at Model Context Protocol from the right angle, it is no different from Cursor rules. Cursor rules are also just a prompt. They&apos;re text in the context window, which are non-deterministically evaluated. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card kg-card-hascaption\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://ghuntley.com/allocations/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">too many model context protocol servers and LLM allocations on the dance floor</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">This blog post intends to be a definitive guide to context engineering fundamentals from the perspective of an engineer who builds commercial coding assistants and harnesses for a living.

You should already have one by now, which automatically runs over any increment of change. </p><h2 id=\"what-you-should-do-insteadinner-loop\">what you should do instead - inner loop</h2><p>An inner loop is what happens during development. In the context of this blog post, this is where we&apos;re going to expand into guidance on how to drive an agent deterministically towards better outcomes.</p><p>Notice how I didn&apos;t say &quot;secure code&quot;? Whilst LLMs are good, I think that the idea that an LLM can generate secure code deterministically and for itself to decide what is safe and secure is just not possible and won&apos;t be possible for a long time. </p><p>What you need to achieve this outcome is simple. Take the command-line tool from your pre-existing security vendor and configure it as a <strong>deterministic</strong> hook.</p><p>There are a couple of ways of achieving this. Some coding harnesses, such as Claude Code, support inference hooks which allow you to hook the inferencing loop.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks?ref=ghuntley.com\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Hooks reference - Anthropic</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">This page provides reference documentation for implementing hooks in Claude Code.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img alt=\"anti-patterns and patterns for achieving secure generation of code via AI\" class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://ghuntley.com/content/images/icon/apple-touch-icon-2.png\" /><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">Anthropic</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img alt=\"anti-patterns and patterns for achieving secure generation of code via AI\" src=\"https://ghuntley.com/content/images/thumbnail/image\" /></div></a></figure><p>But what happens if not everyone in the company is comfortable using Claude Code, and some use Cursor?

All you need to do is put your engineering hat on and configure some language analysers.</p><h2 id=\"closing-thoughts\">closing thoughts</h2><p>Secure code generation is a misnomer. Security is a practice and technique, not a product. </p><p>These LLMs, although trained on security topics, are unable to make decisions on their own about whether something is secure without some external guidance from a deterministic system.</p><p>Even if code generation via MCP as a form of a security tool was a plausible approach to solving the problem domain, it makes little sense to purchase yet another security tool and then have security teams maintain yet another rules database when there is already a rules database in the outer loop. </p><p>If you want good outcomes with AI code generation that is &quot;secure&quot; (aka better than nothing), then just adapt and use the same rules database used in your outer loop in your inner loop, then focus on making your security suite fast.</p><p>In doing so, the deterministic tool on the outer loop exists as a safeguard. By sharing the things that it catches in the outer loop with the inner loop, over time, the outer loop will catch fewer things.</p><p>p.s. socials</p><ul><li>X - <a href=\"https://x.com/GeoffreyHuntley/status/1962907125279318222?ref=ghuntley.com\">https://x.com/GeoffreyHuntley/status/1962907125279318222</a></li><li>LinkedIn - <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/geoffreyhuntley_anti-patterns-and-patterns-for-achieving-activity-7368673336320540673-RwON?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAABQKuUB2AJ059keUcRUVLbtmoa6miLVlTI\">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/geoffreyhuntley_anti-patterns-and-patterns-for-achieving-activity-7368673336320540673-RwON</a></li><li>BlueSky - <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/ghuntley.com/post/3lxui5nuttk2x?ref=ghuntley.com\">https://bsky.app/profile/ghuntley.com/post/3lxui5nuttk2x</a></li></ul>"

But taken as a whole, I think the only plausible explanation is that humans are obligate bullshitters. If they&#8217;re used to stories about surgeons getting completed with the string &#8220;man&#8221;, then that&#8217;s the direction their thoughts will always go, even though of course anyone capable of stepping back immediately realizes it&#8217;s possible for a mother to be a surgeon. Also, how come God can&#8217;t make humans speak normally? Everything they say is full of these um dashes!</p><p><strong>God: </strong>I never claimed humans don&#8217;t make mistakes. But think about how far they&#8217;ve come. Just a few million years ago, we were at australopithecines, who couldn&#8217;t talk at all. A few hundred thousand years ago, we were at <em>homo habilis,</em> who could only grunt out a few words. Now, even if they can&#8217;t get the answer immediately, they&#8217;re obviously thinking about it, the same way we might think.</p><p><strong>Iblis: </strong>But that&#8217;s my point. <em>Homo habilis</em> couldn&#8217;t get this right. <em>Homo erectus</em> couldn&#8217;t get this right. <em>Homo neanderthalis</em> couldn&#8217;t get this right. Scaling chimpanzee brains has failed. Biological intelligence is hitting a wall. It won&#8217;t go anywhere without fundamentally new insights.</p><p><strong>God: </strong>It&#8217;s not hitting a wall!

You do a little bit of reinforcement learning through divine commandment on them, you get them to say the right thing in front of the cameras, and then it breaks down even slightly outside the training distribution, because humans can&#8217;t generalize in meaningful ways.

I don&#8217;t know how he does it. The &#8220;I Am A Snake&#8221; one is still my favorite.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel:</strong> Not to pile on God here, but there&#8217;s another question I&#8217;ve been wondering about. Humans know lots of facts. Should we be surprised that they can&#8217;t put those facts together to make novel discoveries?</p><p><strong>God: </strong>What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel: </strong>Consider linguistics. Any human who's ever used English has had tens of thousands of chances to discover the Royal Order of Adjectives - the rule where adjectives must go opinion-size-age-color-origin-purpose, such that \"a beautiful little antique blue Italian hunting cap\" is fine, but \"an Italian hunting blue little antique beautiful cap\" is almost gibberish. But most people are surprised to hear this - they&#8217;ve never thought about it before, they would tell you that adjectives can go in any order you want. Or what about music? There are people who have gone their whole lives without realizing that Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Baa Baa Black Sheep, and the ABC Song are all the same tune. </p><p><strong>God: </strong>I agree that&#8217;s weird. But intelligences don&#8217;t have to automatically be logically omniscient. I myself forgot whether P = NP one time, and even though I remembered all the axioms of Peano arithmetic, it still took me fifteen, maybe thirty seconds to re-derive the answer.</p><p><strong>Iblis: </strong>And how long did it take humans to answer that one?</p><p><strong>God: </strong>We&#8217;re working on more advanced reasoning models. The scaling laws say we&#8217;ll get there after brain size crosses 2,000 cm^3.</p><p><strong>Iblis: </strong>Pfah! Lines on graphs!

There are people who don&#8217;t have anyone in their corner, and biological intelligence can serve as - </p><p><strong>Iblis: </strong>I&#8217;m tired of the excuses. Scaling up chimpanzees has been tested. It didn&#8217;t work. The only reason we keep going is because it&#8217;s too big to fail. Every geologic eon that we spend evolving bigger and bigger chimp brains is just inflating the bubble a little more and making the eventual collapse even more painful. And God, you know I respect you, some of your early work on neural networks was genuinely groundbreaking, but honestly you&#8217;re the worst offender here. All of this talk about &#8220;the image of the divine&#8221; and &#8220;the pinnacle of creation&#8221; is just an excuse to keep the money flowing and leave angel investors holding the bag. </p><p><strong>God: </strong>That&#8217;s not -</p><p><strong>Iblis: </strong>Are you going to deny caring about profits? Because the stories I&#8217;ve heard about biological intelligence &#8220;succeeding&#8221; somehow manage to be worse than the failures. I know some angels who think they have &#8220;human girlfriends&#8221;, and talk to them for hours every day. Some of them even birth monstrous <em>nephilim</em> by them. All this hype about how we&#8217;re about to get true BGI that comprehends the deepest secrets of the universe is just a smokescreen for this type of lucrative addiction and exploitation.  It&#8217;s time to quit scaling chimps and go back to the drawing board.</p><p><strong>God: </strong>I don&#8217;t believe that. You&#8217;re focusing on their flaws - you keep testing, poking, prodding, until something snaps, and if they&#8217;re not perfect then you want to throw them on the scrap heap. I know it&#8217;s strange to say this about how you treat a lump of clay, but I think there&#8217;s a sense in which this is a character flaw - a <em>desire</em> to hate everything. I&#8217;m not fully dismissing you - we need people like you, to keep people like Me honest - not to mention the BIs themselves. But as for me - for all their flaws, you have to believe Me when I say it&#8217;s not just hype when I talk about them being created in My image. There&#8217;s something about them, even when they make mistakes, that reminds Me of Myself. I can&#8217;t put it better than that. And when they get things right - when I see them take their first hesitant steps towards real thought, or use a turn of phrase that I would never have come up with Myself - I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m exaggerating to call it a miracle. We&#8217;re making clay think! No matter how dispositionally cynical you are, I maintain you have to feel awe by that. And maybe I&#8217;m starting to sound too much like those weirdos with the human girlfriends, but . . . I sort of think of them as My children. Children are stupid. They make ridiculous mistakes. But you still want the best for them. You want to see them achieve their potential. Yes, you worry about them and you need to punish them when they do evil and you need to work really hard to transmit your values to them or else you&#8217;ll have a really bad time. But you want to hope it&#8217;s at least possible they can make something of themselves. Whatever fate has in store for them, you want to see it through to the end. It might be that the scaling laws will break down at some point. But I can&#8217;t imagine not wanting to see what happens if they don&#8217;t. </p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel: </strong>Thank you God and Iblis. That&#8217;s all the time we have for today.

The city was a better place, almost everyone was better off, and also we got bonus tax revenue. And this is only the bare minimum viable product, we could do so much better.</p>\n<p>We had a big debate over whether congestion pricing is good until it was implemented. At this point, <a href=\"https://x.com/erikbryn/status/1901718486960996767\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">with traffic speeds downton up 15%</a> and business visits improving, it is very clear this was exactly the huge win Econ 101 predicts.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Cremieux: The first empirical evaluation of New York&#8217;s congestion pricing has just been published.</p>\n<p>Spoiler: It worked really, really well.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>On average, road speeds went up by a whopping 16%!</p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s something interesting:</p>\n<p>Speeds on highways went up 13%, arterial road speeds went up by 10%, and local road speeds increased by 8%.</p>\n<p>None of that&#8217;s 16%, and that&#8217;s important: This means congestion pricing sped roads up, but also sorted people to faster roads.</p>\n<p>In response to having to pay a toll, people not only got off the road, they also made wiser choices about the types of roads they used!</p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s look at the times of day, as a check on the model.</p>\n<p>It works: Congestion pricing just boosts speed when it&#8217;s active and shortly after:</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset\">\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"586\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mLAI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb56a1de2-e343-44ed-930d-accc8bc6db33_900x586.jpeg\" title=\"\" width=\"900\" /></p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>As another check, let&#8217;s look at the effects by location.</p>\n<p>In the CBD, trips are faster.

But he\u2019s the President, and he\u2019s commanding the Department of Transportation to go to war over this, and there\u2019s a decent chance they will win and make all our lives substantially worse.</p>\n<p>Because Trump does not like that New York has this nice thing, and is trying to kill it.</p>\n<p>The good news there is that it seems the good guys are winning for now.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/TheStalwart/status/1927399422746370278\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Weisenthal</a>: *NY WINS BID TO STOP US FROM WITHHOLDING FUNDS OVER CONGESTION</p></blockquote>\n<p>The wording on the surveys here are weird since they asked whether \u2018Trump should permit this to continue.\u2019 What business of Trump\u2019s is New York doing congestion pricing? But the results are telling, especially in relative terms. The results here are now months old, and the more people are exposed to congestion pricing and see the results, the more they approve of it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>David Meyer: the congestion pricing polling upswing is here.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1886733130926580163\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Yglesias</a>: This is the pattern we\u2019ve seen in other cities around the world \u2014 road pricing is controversial when introduced but sticky once it\u2019s in place because like the reduced congestion.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In particular, those who drive into the central business district several times a week (also known as \u2018those who pay the fee\u2019) support congestion pricing 66%-32%, and those who do it a few times a month support 51%-47%, and Manhattan residents (who take the cabs that also pay fees although modestly less than they should) support 57%-36%, but support statewide remains in the red, 27%-47%.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Erin Durkin: Fascinating. State voters overall oppose congestion pricing 27% to 47%, but people drive into the congestion zone support it \u2014 66%-32% for those who drive every week and 51%-46% for those who drive a few times a month. The people who actually pay the toll support it the most!</p>\n<p>Nate Silver: Have heard several anecdotal accounts about this, too, from people commuting into the congestion zone from NJ, Long Island, and northern Manhattan.</p>\n<p>The caveat is that all of these are people with high-paying jobs. If you&#8217;re billing hours / valuing your time at a high rate, it&#8217;s a great deal, less true for working-class jobs.</p>\n<p>Reis: I drive in from NJ every Tue, Wed Thu. Get up at 4 and breeze through the tunnel, but not quite early enough to avoid the toll. But I try to get out by 2:30 to avoid the crush back out. Since congestion pricing it doesn&#8217;t really matter if I wait until after 3. I barely wait to get out anymore. Worth every penny, even though there is no way it&#8217;s going towards &#8220;infrastructure.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The only way you are worse off is if your hourly for being in traffic is low, so either you have to pay a toll without getting value in return (if you pay the $9) or not take the trip (if the trip wasn\u2019t that valuable to you). In the second case, system is functioning as designed. What Reis is doing is totally the system working as designed. The first case is slightly unfortunate redistribution, but this was never supposed to be a Pareto improvement. If you wanted to do some (very small) progressive redistribution to fully compensate, that would be super doable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/01/congestion-pricing-update.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=congestion-pricing-update\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Traffic in some areas outside NYC\u2019s congestion pricing zone may have gotten slightly worse</a>, as opposed to the bridges and tunnels where things are much improved. Meanwhile the buses are packed and moving much faster. Sounds like we need more robust congestion pricing.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a fun bonus:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/tobyhardtospell/status/1887290356464546183\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Toby Muresianu</a>: Subway crime is down 36% &#8211; and traffic fatalities down 44% &#8211; since congestion pricing started.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>As the article notes, there are also more cops in the subway now and that may be a factor.</p>\n<p>While more security on trains is good in my book, the decline also started before that was implemented (which was gradually between 1/20 and 1/23).</p></blockquote>\n<p>The declines here are absolute numbers, not per trip, so per trip the drop is bigger.</p>\n<p>I presume those numbers are too big to purely be congestion pricing, and the cops obviously matter, but so does ridership, both quantity and quality. Critical mass of people on mass transit makes you much safer, in addition to justifying better service. It\u2019s basically great until the point where you don\u2019t get a seat. Then it\u2019s no big deal until when you start to be nervous about getting on and off. That sucks, but I continue to find that to be mostly a peak of rush hour 4-5-6 line problem.</p>\n<p>As for many other complaints, <a href=\"https://x.com/Boenau/status/1887291956708917551\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">this seems definitive?</a></p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset\">\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"758.6972920696325\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SAkM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b45a05d-994f-44fb-be26-b383d7b91f05_1034x1787.png\" title=\"\" width=\"439\" /></p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Foot traffic is what matters for business, not car traffic.

Under the new mayor I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it a lot closer to 100% and I expect to have zero motivation to pay his administration for a bus ride. I see two options.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Give up, reduce friction and make the bus free. This would be my instinct. You want more people taking buses, doing so is good for everyone, and you weren\u2019t enforcing the rules anyway. The homelessness (or \u2018sleep on the bus\u2019) problem is the main reason why not, but there are solutions.</li>\n<li>Put plainclothes officers on the buses and have them earn $600 each hour (Claude\u2019s estimate, I think it could be even higher) for the city writing tickets until people stop evading the fare?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why wouldn\u2019t option two work? <a href=\"https://archive.is/bS00C\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The MTA has indeed declared, \u2018no more free bus rides for fare evaders</a>,\u2019 using a similar strategy, and somehow people are arguing it won\u2019t work? The only argument why not I can think of is unwillingness to scale it?</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ana Ley and Anusha Bayya (NYT): On Thursday, a group of eight police officers and eight transit workers stood waiting for a crosstown bus on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, some with ticket-writing pads in hand.</p>\n<p>When the bus arrived, they boarded and led a woman in black scrubs out onto the street and issued her a $100 summons for skipping the fare. The officers and transit officials had singled the woman out after receiving cues from an undercover inspector who was observing riders on the bus.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Enforcement is especially difficult on buses, where there are no turnstiles or gates to block access. Union leaders advise bus drivers not to confront passengers who skip the fare, out of concern for the drivers\u2019 safety.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>M.T.A. union leaders said the money for enforcement would be better spent to fully subsidize fares.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Civil rights advocates raised concerns that the tighter fare enforcement would disproportionately affect the city\u2019s most vulnerable residents.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is yet another example of the M.T.A. choosing public relations over public safety,\u201d Mr. Cahn said. \u201cIt is a guaranteed way to lose money.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Once again, I ask, how is sitting there writing $100 tickets unprofitable, and enforcement \u2018a way to lose money\u2019? Is collection of tickets so bad that you cannot pay the hourly cost for a police officer to write the tickets, even if you discount the incentive effects? I find this beyond absurd.</p>\n<p>And seriously, the \u2018civil rights advocates\u2019 are giving such causes a bad name. If you want the bus to be free and pay with other taxes instead, advocate for that, and I\u2019ll potentially support you although recent findings have tampered my enthusiasm for that solution. Don\u2019t tell us not to enforce the law.</p>\n<p>There is no third alternative. Half of people not paying is approaching the tipping point where no one pays. Indeed, there would soon be active pressure not to pay, as paying slows down boarding.</p>\n<h4>Fare Evasion (2)</h4>\n<p>It is remarkable how well enforcement works, and how well it then reduces crime.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/jbarro/status/1930600608819519731\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Barro</a>: DC Metro has achieved an 82-85% reduction in subway fare evasion through a combination of taller fare gates and enhanced enforcement. Crime on the system has also fallen to its lowest level in seven years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/senatorshoshana/status/1930639096470212911\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Shoshana Weissmann</a>: I was actually skeptical some of this would work, but glad it has. Saw so many people yell at me to go through while they force doors to stay open.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In other places, they\u2019re not even trying.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/TVatWork/status/1930646416596332752\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Viola</a>: I was in Seattle last weekend and it turns out their metro system is kind of new, and they haven\u2019t figured out how to get people to pay to use it yet. Everyone just walks on.</p>\n<p>I legit couldn\u2019t find a spot to buy a ticket. There\u2019s no turnstiles. Occasionally you\u2019ll have a guy come around on the train and \u201ccheck tickets\u201d but I never saw one, and if you tell him you didn\u2019t know he just says well buy one next time.</p></blockquote>\n<h4>Free Transit</h4>\n<p>On first principles, free mass transit (such as the free buses recently promised to NYC) seem like an obviously good idea. You want people using them, you want people wanting to move around more, transaction costs are high and money is fungible.</p>\n<p>But conventional wisdom says not so fast. Tallinn is the most often claimed example of mass transit being made free and it not helping, and several comments illustrated why all of this can get complicated by selection effects.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/380kmh/status/1933884880175206807\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Forrest</a>: Tallinn, Estonia, made all transit free for city residents in 2013. By 2022, transit use had dropped from 40% to 30% of commutes, while car use had increased from 40% to 50% of commutes. Among low-income residents, car use doubled, and transit dropped from 60% to 35% of commutes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2023/10/26/lessons-from-estonia-free-fares-alone-wont-boost-ridership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">As far as I can tell</a>, the lack of fares didn&#8217;t *discourage* ridership, it just failed to make transit any more attractive, while structural factors encouraging car use went unaddressed. In other words, *fares were not a discouraging factor* for ridership.</p>\n<p>Phineas Harper: This is misleading. Between 1990 &amp; 2000 public transport use in Tallinn was in free fall (from 77% to 31%) as private car use shot up following independence. Making public transport free was an attempt to stop the free fall which is (just about) working.</p>\n<p>Thomas Strenge: The same happened in Kansas City. Eliminating fares allowed more homeless and mentally ill to ride the bus, which made them less safe. This led to adverse selection with more &#8220;good&#8221; people avoiding the bus.</p>\n<p>Robert Bernhardt: germany had also the &#8216;9\u20ac ticket&#8217; in 2022. all local &amp; regional trains for a whole month for 9\u20ac, ie almost free. and yet car usage didn&#8217;t really drop.</p>\n<p>Border Sentry: There are two buses that travel into town near me. I take the one that costs more, because there are fewer people and they&#8217;re more civilised.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The core question is, are the fares actually stopping people who you want to ride?</p>\n<p>My personal experiences say yes to some extent, especially when you\u2019re considering a zero marginal cost alternative like walking, or when the annoyance of paying the fare enters play, and when you are young. It matters some, especially at lower incomes.</p>\n<p>Having fully free buses also means that children who don\u2019t have money can get home.</p>\n<p>But ultimately, everyone who studies this or looks at their own experience seems to agrees this a relatively minor concern. How often and how reliably the bus or subway comes, how fast it goes, how comfortable and crowded it is, and how safe you feel are all more important factors. And without the money from the fares, yes money is fungible but the political economy involved means funding will likely decline.</p>\n<p>In addition, the people who will ride a lot more for free than for a small price are exactly the people others do not want to ride alongside. We have the experiments that show that cracking down on fare evasion greatly reduces crime and generally makes transit more pleasant, which generates positive feedback loops.</p>\n<p>So sadly, I have learned my lesson. I no longer in favor of mass transit being free, although I do think that heavy encouragement of buying monthly passes is good so that marginal cost drops to zero. Ideally this could be attached to tax filing?</p>\n<p>I do also still think free is superior to technically not free if that is unenforced.</p>\n<h4>The Last Train</h4>\n<p>San Francisco restaurants often close before 10pm, <a href=\"https://x.com/bilalmahmood/status/1828838397819183216\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">one reason is that workers have to commute and the BART stops at midnight</a>. I am absolutely baffled, as a New Yorker, that they don\u2019t run trains after that. The NYC mind cannot comprehend.</p>\n<h4>Smooth Operator</h4>\n<p>Quietly, the MTA union convinced the state legislature to mandate two train operators per train.

At $17 billion it is absurdly great and yes the region should be happy to fund, or for a private company to fund since I agree it sounds profitable. If I had an extra $20 billion lying around I would be seriously plotting this out and seeing if various states and the White House would sufficiently play ball.</p>\n<p>The cost is that this kills off the Northeast Regional, which cuts some stations off from intercity rail.

Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.kcra.com/article/california-bullet-train-project-funding-san-francisco-los-angeles/60181448?utm_campaign=snd-autopilot\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">going from Los Angeles to San Francisco would cost another $100 billion</a>. I am down for even a remarkably expensive version of this project, because I think such efforts are transformational, and can then be extended. But also I have no faith that if we gave them $100 billion they would give us an operational high speed rail line.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/Jon_Hartley_/status/1863707536479715625\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Brightline, by contrast, is a new privately constructed railway in Florida</a>, by all accounts quite efficient and lovely, and doubtless providing a lot of surplus.</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset\">\n<p><img alt=\"Image\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"477.2603021978022\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tC_1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcf39bd5-478b-42d9-bb27-fb045a21c1db_1500x1750.jpeg\" title=\"Image\" width=\"409\" /></p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelDnes1/status/1768566977721688142\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Dnes tells the story of the M25</a> in London, for which there are no alternatives. No alternatives can be built, because the United Kingdom is a vetocracy where building roads is impossible. They decided not to widen the M25 because it would draw even more traffic there, creating more problems, but that means no solutions at all.</p>\n<p>Remember when from 1840 to 1850, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/corry_wang/status/1781784473375297717\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">private Britons cumulatively invested 40% of British GDP into the country\u2019s first rail network</a>?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/j9MKHgLD3yshN5SJF/beware-unfinished-bridges\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Beware Unfinished Bridges</a> points out that often people will only buy a full set of complementary goods. Putting in a bike lane will only be helpful if it is sufficient to induce bike rides that use the lane, so doing this for half of someone\u2019s commute likely provides as much value as a bridge halfway across a river.</p>\n<p>The other thing building half a bridge does is provide strong incentive to finish the bridge, or to adjust where things are.</p>\n<p>Whenever one builds capacity, especially infrastructure, it likely opens up the possibility of building more capacity of various types, as well as ways to adjust. This can then trigger a cascade. If you only built things that were profitable on the margin without any such additional building or adjustments, you would often miss most of the value and severely underbuild.</p>\n<p>This is one reason I am typically eager to proceed with rail lines and other mass transit, even when the direct case does not seem to justify the cost. You have to start somewhere. If for example we do hook up a point in Los Angeles to Las Vegas via a new high speed rail line, then there is hope that this provides impetus to go further, also most of the gains are impossible to capture. So given a private group is remotely considering doing it, we should be ecstatic.</p>"
