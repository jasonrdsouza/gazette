In this article we&rsquo;ll discuss the results of the 2025 Go Developer\nSurvey, conducted during September 2025.</p>\n<p>Thank you to the 5,379 Go developers who responded to our survey invitation\nthis year. Your feedback helps both the Go team at Google and the wider Go\ncommunity understand the current state of the Go ecosystem and prioritize\nprojects for the year ahead.</p>\n<p>Our three biggest findings are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Broadly speaking, Go developers asked for help with identifying and applying\nbest practices, making the most of the standard library, and expanding the\nlanguage and built-in tooling with more modern capabilities.</li>\n<li>Most Go developers are now using AI-powered development tools when seeking\ninformation (e.g., learning how to use a module) or toiling (e.g., writing\nrepetitive blocks of similar code), but their satisfaction with these tools\nis middling due, in part, to quality concerns.</li>\n<li>A surprisingly high proportion of respondents said they frequently need to\nreview documentation for core <code>go</code> subcommands, including <code>go build</code>, <code>go run</code>, and <code>go mod</code>, suggesting meaningful room for improvement with the <code>go</code>\ncommand&rsquo;s help system.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read on for the details about these findings, and much more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sections\">Sections</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/feed.atom#demographics\">Who did we hear from?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/feed.atom#sentiment\">How do people feel about Go?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/feed.atom#uses\">What are people building with Go?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/feed.atom#challenges\">What are the biggest challenges facing Go\ndevelopers?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/feed.atom#devenv\">What do their development environments look like?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/feed.atom#methodology\">Survey methodology</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"demographics\">Who did we hear from?</h2>\n<p>Most survey respondents self-identified as professional developers (87%) who\nuse Go for their primary job (82%). A large majority also uses Go for personal\nor open-source projects (72%). Most respondents were between 25 \u2013 45\nyears old (68%) with at least six years of professional development experience\n(75%). Going deeper, 81% of respondents told us they had more professional\ndevelopment experience than Go-specific experience, strong evidence that Go is\nusually not the first language developers work with. In fact, one of the\nthemes that repeatedly surfaced during this year&rsquo;s survey analysis seems to\nstem from this fact: when the way to do a task in Go is substantially\ndifferent from a more familiar language, it creates friction for developers to\nfirst learn the new (to them) idiomatic Go pattern, and then to consistently\nrecall these differences as they continue to work with multiple languages.\nWe&rsquo;ll return to this theme later.</p>\n<p>The single most common industry respondents work in was &ldquo;Technology&rdquo; (46%),\nbut a majority of respondents work outside of the tech industry (54%). We saw\nrepresentation of all sizes of organizations, with a bare majority working\nsomewhere with 2 \u2013 500 employees (51%), 9% working alone, and 30%\nworking at enterprises of over 1,000 employees. As in prior years, a majority\nof responses come from North America and Europe.</p>\n<p>This year we observed a decrease in the proportion of respondents who said\nthey were fairly new to Go, having worked with it for less than one year\n(13%, vs. 21% in 2024). We suspect this is related to <a href=\"https://digitaleconomy.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Canaries_BrynjolfssonChandarChen.pdf\">industry-wide\ndeclines in entry-level software engineering roles</a>; we commonly hear from\npeople that they learned Go for a specific job, so a downturn in hiring would\nbe expected to reduce the number of developers learning Go in that year. This\nhypothesis is further supported by our finding that over 80% of respondents\nlearned Go <em>after</em> beginning their professional career.</p>\n<p>Other than the above, we found no significant changes in other demographics\nsince our 2024 survey.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"During the past year, in which types of\nsituations have you used Go?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/where.svg\" /> <img alt=\"How long have you been using Go?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/go_exp.svg\" /> <img alt=\"Which of the following\nbest describe how or why you work with Go?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/role.svg\" /> <img alt=\"How old are you?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/age.svg\" /> <img alt=\"How many years of professional coding\nexperience do you have?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/pro_dev_exp.svg\" /> <img alt=\"How many people work at your organization?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/org_size.svg\" /> <img alt=\"Which of the following best describes the\nindustry in which your organization operates?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/industry.svg\" /> <img alt=\"Where do you live?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/location.svg\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"sentiment\">How do people feel about Go?</h2>\n<p>The vast majority of respondents (91%) said they felt satisfied while working\nwith Go. Almost \u2154 were &ldquo;very satisfied&rdquo;, the highest rating. Both of these\nmetrics are incredibly positive, and have been stable since we began asking\nthis question in 2019. The stability over time is really what we monitor from\nthis metric \u2014 we view it as a lagging indicator, meaning by the time\nthis satisfaction metric shows a meaningful change, we would expect to already\nhave seen earlier signals from issue reports, mailing lists, or other\ncommunity feedback.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Overall, how satisfied or dissatisfied\nhave you been using Go during the past year?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/csat.svg\" /></p>\n<p>Why were respondents so positive about Go? Looking at open-text responses to\nseveral different survey questions suggests that it&rsquo;s the gestalt, rather than\nany one thing. These folks are telling us that they find tremendous value in\nGo as a holistic platform. That doesn&rsquo;t mean it supports all programming\ndomains equally well (it surely does not), but that developers&rsquo; value the\ndomains it <em>does</em> nicely support via stdlib and built-in tooling.</p>\n<p>Below are some representative quotations from respondents. To provide context\nfor each quote, we also identify the satisfaction level, years of experience\nwith Go, and industry of the respondent.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Go is by far my favorite language; other languages feel far too complex and\nunhelpful. The fact that Go is comparatively small, simple, with fewer bells\nand whistles plays a massive role in making it such a good long-lasting\nfoundation for building programs with it. I love that it scales well to\nbeing used by a single programmer and in large teams.&rdquo; <span class=\"quote_source\">\u2014 Very satisfied / 10+ years / Technology\ncompany</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The entire reason I use Go is the great tooling and standard library.  I&rsquo;m\nvery thankful to the team for focusing on great HTTP, crypto, math, sync,\nand other tools that make developing service-oriented applications easy and\nreliable.&rdquo; <span class=\"quote_source\">\u2014 Very satisfied / 10+ years /\nEnergy company</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;[The] Go ecosystem is the reason why I really like the programming\nlanguage. There are a lot of npm issues lately but not with Go.&rdquo; <span class=\"quote_source\">\u2014 Very satisfied / 3 \u2013 10 years / Financial\nservices</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This year we also asked about the other languages that people use. Survey\nrespondents said that besides Go, they enjoy working with Python, Rust, and\nTypeScript, among a long tail of other languages. Some shared characteristics\nof these languages align with common points of friction reported by Go\ndevelopers, including  areas like error handling, enums, and object-oriented\ndesign patterns. For example, when we sum the proportion of respondents who\nsaid their next-favorite language included one of the following factors, we\nfound that majorities of respondents enjoy using languages with inheritance,\ntype-safe enums, and exceptions, with only a bare majority of these languages\nincluding a static type system by default.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Concept or feature</th>\n<th>Proportion of respondents</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Inheritance</td>\n<td>71%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type-safe enums</td>\n<td>65%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Exceptions</td>\n<td>60%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Static typing</td>\n<td>51%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We think this is important because it reveals the larger environment in which\ndevelopers operate \u2014 it suggests that people need to use different\ndesign patterns for fairly mundane tasks, depending on the language of the\ncodebase they&rsquo;re currently working on. This leads to additional cognitive load\nand confusion, not only among developers new to Go (who must learn idiomatic\nGo design patterns), but also among the many developers who work in multiple\ncodebases or projects. One way to alleviate this additional load is\ncontext-specific guidance, such as a tutorial on &ldquo;Error handling in Go for\nJava developers&rdquo;. There may even be opportunities to build some of this\nguidance into code analyzers, making it easier to surface directly in an IDE.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Not including Go, what's your favorite\nprogramming language?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/fav_lang.svg\" /></p>\n<p>This year we asked the Go community to share their sentiment towards the Go\nproject itself. These results were quite different from the 91% satisfaction\nrate we discussed above, and point to areas the Go Team plans to invest our\nenergy during 2026. In particular, we want to encourage more contributors to\nget involved, and ensure the Go Team accurately understands the challenges Go\ndevelopers currently face. We hope this focus, in turn, will help to increase\ndeveloper trust in both the Go project and the Go Team leadership. As one\nrespondent explained the problem:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Now that the founding first generation of Go Team members [are] not\ninvolved much anymore in the decision making, I am a bit worried about the\nfuture of Go in terms of quality of maintenance, and its balanced decisions\nso far wrt to changes in the language and std lib. More presence in form of\ntalks [by] the new core team members about the current state and future\nplans might be helpful to strengthen trust.&rdquo; <span class=\"quote_source\">\u2014 Very satisfied / 10+ years / Technology\ncompany</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img alt=\"To what extent do you agree or disagree\nwith the following statements?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/trust.svg\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"uses\">What are people building with Go?</h2>\n<p>We revised this list of &ldquo;what types of things do you build with Go?&rdquo; from 2024\nwith the intent of more usefully teasing apart what people are building with\nGo, and avoid confusion around evolving terms like &ldquo;agents&rdquo;. Respondent&rsquo;s top\nuse cases remain CLIs and API services, with no meaningful change in either\nsince 2024. In fact, a majority of respondents (55%) said they build <em>both</em>\nCLIs and API services with Go. Over \u2153 of respondents specifically build cloud\ninfrastructure tooling (a new category), and 11% work with ML models, tools,\nor agents (an expanded category). Unfortunately embedded use cases were left\noff of the revised list, but we&rsquo;ll fix this for next year&rsquo;s survey.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"What types of things do you build with\nGo?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/build.svg\" /></p>\n<p>Most respondents said they are not currently building AI-powered features into\nthe Go software they work on (78%), with \u2154 reporting that their software does\nnot use AI functionality at all (66%). This appears to be a decrease in\nproduction-related AI usage year-over-year; in 2024, 59% of respondents were\nnot involved in AI feature work, while 39% indicated some level of\ninvolvement. That marks a shift of 14 points away from building AI-powered\nsystems among survey respondents, and may reflect some natural pullback from\nthe early hype around AI-powered applications: it&rsquo;s plausible that lots of\nfolks tried to see what they could do with this technology during its initial\nrollout, with some proportion deciding against further exploration (at least\nat this time).</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Think about the Go software that you've\nworked on the most during the past month. Does it use AI for any of its\nfunctionality?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/genai.svg\" /></p>\n<p>Among respondents who are building AI- or LLM-powered functionality, the most\ncommon use case was to create summaries of existing content (45%). Overall,\nhowever, there was little difference between most uses, with between 28%\n\u2013 33% of respondents adding AI functionality to support classification,\ngeneration, solution identification, chatbots, and software development.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"The Go software that I build uses AI\nor LLMs to:\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/genai_use.svg\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"challenges\">What are the biggest challenges facing Go developers?</h2>\n<p>One of the most helpful types of feedback we receive from developers are\ndetails about the challenges people run into while working with Go. The Go\nTeam considers this information holistically and over long time horizons,\nbecause there is often tension between improving Go&rsquo;s rougher edges and\nkeeping the language and tooling consistent for developers. Beyond technical\nfactors, every change also incurs some cost in terms of developer attention\nand cognitive disruption. Minimizing disruption may sound a bit dull or\nboring, but we view this as an important strength of Go. As Russ Cox wrote in\n2023, <a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/compat\">&ldquo;Boring is good&hellip; Boring means being able to focus on your work, not\non what&rsquo;s different about Go.&rdquo;</a>.</p>\n<p>In that spirit, this year&rsquo;s top challenges are not radically different from\nlast year&rsquo;s. The top three frustrations respondents reported were &ldquo;Ensuring\nour Go code follows best practices / Go idioms&rdquo; (33% of respondents), &ldquo;A\nfeature I value from another language isn&rsquo;t part of Go&rdquo; (28%), and &ldquo;Finding\ntrustworthy Go modules and packages&rdquo; (26%). We examined open-text responses to\nbetter understand what people meant. Let&rsquo;s take a minute to dig into each.</p>\n<p>Respondents who were most frustrated by writing idiomatic Go were often\nlooking for more official guidance, as well as tooling support to help enforce\nthis guidance in their codebase. As in prior surveys, questions about how to\nstructure Go projects were also a common theme. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The simplicity of go helps to read and understand code from other\ndevelopers, but there are still some aspects that can differ quite a lot\nbetween programmers. Especially if developers come from other languages,\ne.g. Java.&rdquo; <span class=\"quote_source\">\u2014 Very satisfied / 3 \u2013 10\nyears / Healthcare and life sciences</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;More opinionated way to write go code. Like how to structure a Go project\nfor services/cli tool.&rdquo; <span class=\"quote_source\">\u2014 Very satisfied /\n&lt; 3 years / Technology</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to figure out what are good idioms. Especially since the core\nteam doesn&rsquo;t keep Effective Go up-to-date.&rdquo; <span class=\"quote_source\">\u2014 Very satisfied / 3 \u2013 10 years /\nTechnology</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second major category of frustrations were language features that\ndevelopers enjoyed working with in other ecosystems. These open-text comments\nlargely focused on error handling and reporting patterns, enums and sum types,\nnil pointer safety, and general expressivity / verbosity:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Still not sure what is the best way to do error handling.&rdquo; <span class=\"quote_source\">\u2014 Very satisfied / 3 \u2013 10 years / Retail\nand consumer goods</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Rust&rsquo;s enums are great, and lead to writing great type safe code.&rdquo; <span class=\"quote_source\">\u2014 Somewhat satisfied / 3 \u2013 10 years /\nHealthcare and life sciences</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;There is nothing (in the compiler) that stops me from using a maybe nil\npointer, or using a value without checking the err first. That should be\n[baked into] the type system.&rdquo; <span class=\"quote_source\">\u2014 Somewhat\nsatisfied / &lt; 3 years / Technology</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;I like [Go] but I didn&rsquo;t expect it to have nil pointer exceptions :)&rdquo; <span class=\"quote_source\">\u2014 Somewhat satisfied / 3 \u2013 10 years /\nFinancial services</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;I often find it hard to build abstractions and to provide clear intention\nto the future readers of my code.&rdquo; <span class=\"quote_source\">\u2014\nSomewhat dissatisfied / &lt; 3 years / Technology</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The third major frustration was finding trustworthy Go modules. Respondents\noften described two aspects to this problem. One is that they considered many\n3rd-party modules to be of marginal quality, making it hard for really good\nmodules to stand out. The second is identifying which modules are commonly\nused and under which types of conditions (including recent trends over time).\nThese are both problems that could be addressed by showing what we&rsquo;ll vaguely\ncall &ldquo;quality signals&rdquo; on pkg.go.dev. Respondents provided helpful\nexplanations of the signals they use to identify trustworthy modules,\nincluding project activity, code quality, recent adoption trends, or the\nspecific organizations that support or rely upon the module.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Being able to filter by criteria like stable version, number of users and\nlast update age at pkg.go.dev could make things a bit easier.&rdquo; <span class=\"quote_source\">\u2014 Very satisfied / &lt; 3 years / Technology</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Many pacakges are just clones/forks or one-off pojects with no\nhistory/maintenance. [sic]&rdquo; <span class=\"quote_source\">\u2014 Very\nsatisfied / 10+ years / Financial services</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Maybe flagging trustworthy packages based on experience, maturity and\ncommunity feedback?&rdquo; <span class=\"quote_source\">\u2014 Very satisfied / 3\n\u2013 10 years / Healthcare and life sciences</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We agree that these are all areas where the developer experience with Go could\nbe improved. The challenge, as discussed earlier, is doing so in such a way\nthat doesn&rsquo;t lead to breaking changes, increased confusion among Go\ndevelopers, or otherwise gets in the way of people trying to get their work\ndone with Go. Feedback from this survey is a major source of information we\nuse when discussing proposals, but if you&rsquo;d like to get involved more directly\nor follow along with other contributors, visit the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3AProposal\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Go proposals on\nGitHub</a>;\nplease be sure to <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/proposal\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">follow this process</a> if\nyou&rsquo;d like to add a new proposal.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"What are your three most\nfrustrating things about working with Go?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/frustrations.svg\" /></p>\n<p>In addition to these (potentially) ecosystem-wide challenges, this year we\nalso asked specifically about working with the <code>go</code> command. We&rsquo;ve informally\nheard from developers that this tool&rsquo;s help system can be confusing to\nnavigate, but we haven&rsquo;t had a great sense of how frequently people find\nthemselves reviewing this documentation.</p>\n<p>Respondents told us that except for <code>go test</code>, between 15% \u2013 25% of them\nfelt they &ldquo;often needed to review documentation&rdquo; with working with these\ntools. This was surprising, especially for commonly-used subcommands like\n<code>build</code> and <code>run</code>. Common reasons included remembering specific flags,\nunderstanding what different options do, and navigating the help system\nitself. Participants also confirmed that infrequent use was one reason for\nfrustration, but navigating and parsing command help appears to be the\nunderlying cause. In other words, we all expect to need to review\ndocumentation sometimes, but we don&rsquo;t expect to need help navigating the\ndocumentation system itself. As on respondent described their journey:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Accessing the help is painful. go test &ndash;help # didn&rsquo;t work, but tell[s] me\nto type <code>go help test</code> instead&hellip; go help test # oh, actually, the info I&rsquo;m\nlooking for is in <code>testflag</code> go help testflag # visually parsing through\ntext that looks all the same without much formatting&hellip; I just lack time to\ndig into this rabbit hole.&rdquo; <span class=\"quote_source\">\u2014 Very\nsatisfied / 10+ years / Technology</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img alt=\"Do you find yourself frequently\nreviewing documentation for any of the following Go subcommands?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/go_help.svg\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"devenv\">What does their development environment look like?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"operating-systems-and-architectures\">Operating systems and architectures</h3>\n<p>Generally, respondents told us their development platforms are UNIX-like. Most\nrespondents develop on macOS (60%) or Linux (58%) and deploy to Linux-based\nsystems, including containers (96%). The largest year-over-year change was\namong &ldquo;embedded devices / IoT&rdquo; deployments, which increased from 2% -&gt; 8% of\nrespondents; this was the only meaningful change in deployment platforms since\n2024.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of respondents develop on x86-64 or ARM64 architectures,\nwith a sizable group (25%) still potentially working on 32-bit x86 systems.\nHowever, we believe the wording of this question was confusing to respondents;\nnext year we&rsquo;ll clarify the 32-bit vs. 64-bit distinction for each\narchitecture.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Which platforms do you use when writing\nGo code?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/os_dev.svg\" /> <img alt=\"Which systems\ndo you deploy your Go software to?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/deploy.svg\" /> <img alt=\"Which architectures do you deploy your Go\nsoftware to?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/arch.svg\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"code-editors\">Code editors</h3>\n<p>Several new code editors have become available in the past two years, and we\nexpanded our survey question to include the most popular ones. While we saw\nsome evidence of early adoption, most respondents continued to favor <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">VS\nCode</a> (37%) or\n<a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/go/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GoLand</a> (28%). Of the newer editors, Zed and\nCursor were the highest ranked, each becoming the preferred editor of 4% of\nrespondents. To put those numbers in context, we looked back at when VS Code\nand GoLand were first introduced. VS Code (released in 2015) was favored by\n16% of respondents one year after its release. IntelliJ has had a\ncommunity-led Go plugin longer than we&rsquo;ve been surveying Go developers (\ud83d\udc99),\nbut if we look at when JetBrains began officially supporting Go in IntelliJ\n(2016), within one year IntelliJ was preferred by 20% of respondents.</p>\n<p>Note: This analysis of code editors does not include respondents who were\nreferred to the survey directly from VS Code or GoLand.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"What is your favorite code editor for\nGo?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/editor.svg\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"cloud-environments\">Cloud environments</h3>\n<p>The most common deployment environments for Go continue to be Amazon Web\nServices (AWS) at 46% of respondents, company-owned servers (44%), and Google\nCloud Platform (GCP) at 26%. These numbers show minor shifts since 2024, but\nnothing statistically significant. We found that the &ldquo;Other&rdquo; category\nincreased to 11% this year, and this was primarily driven by Hetzner (20% of\nOther responses); we plan to include Hetzner as a response choice in next\nyear&rsquo;s survey.</p>\n<p>We also asked respondents about their development experience of working with\ndifferent cloud providers. The most common responses, however, showed that\nrespondents weren&rsquo;t really sure (46%) or don&rsquo;t directly interact with public\ncloud providers (21%). The biggest driver behind these responses was a theme\nwe&rsquo;ve heard often before: with containers, it&rsquo;s possible to abstract many\ndetails of the cloud environment away from the developer, so that they don&rsquo;t\nmeaningfully interact with most provider-specific technologies. This result\nsuggests that even developers whose work is <em>deployed</em> to clouds may have\nlimited experience with the larger suite of tools and technology associated\nwith each cloud provider. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Kinda abstract to the platform, Go is very easy to put in a container and\nso pretty easy to deploy anywhere: one of its big strength[s].&rdquo; <span class=\"quote_source\">\u2014 [no satisfaction response] / 3 \u2013 10 years\n/ Technology</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The cloud provider really doesn&rsquo;t make much difference to me. I write code\nand deploy it to containers, so whether that&rsquo;s AWS or GCP I don&rsquo;t really\ncare.&rdquo; <span class=\"quote_source\">\u2014 Somewhat satisfied / 3 \u2013 10\nyears / Financial services</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We suspect this level of abstraction is dependant on the use case and\nrequirements of the service that&rsquo;s being deployed \u2014 it may not always\nmake sense or be possible to keep it highly abstracted. In the future, we plan\nto further investigate how Go developers tend to interact with the platforms\nwhere their software is ultimately deployed.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"My team at work deploys Go programs\nto:\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/work_deploy.svg\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"In your experience, which\npublic cloud provider offers the best experience for Go developers?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/favorite_go_cloud.svg\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"developing-with-ai\">Developing with AI</h3>\n<p>Finally, we can&rsquo;t discuss development environments in 2025 without also\nmentioning AI-powered software development tools. Our survey suggests\nbifurcated adoption \u2014 while a majority of respondents (53%) said they\nuse such tools daily, there is also a large group (29%) who do not use these\nat all, or only used them a few times during the past month. We expected this\nto negatively correlate with age or development experience, but were unable to\nfind strong evidence supporting this theory except for <em>very</em> new developers:\nrespondents with less than one year of professional development experience\n(not specific to Go) did report more AI use than every other cohort, but this\ngroup only represented 2% of survey respondents.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"During the past month, how often did\nyou use AI-powered tools when writing Go?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/ai_freq.svg\" /></p>\n<p>At this time, agentic use of AI-powered tools appears nascent among Go\ndevelopers, with only 17% of respondents saying this is their primary way of\nusing such tools, though a larger group (40%) are occasionally trying agentic\nmodes of operation.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"When working with AI-powered\ndevelopment tools, do you tend to use them as unsupervised agents?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/ai_agent.svg\" /></p>\n<p>The most commonly used AI assistants remain ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and\nClaude. Most of these agents show lower usage numbers <a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2024-h2-results#ai-assistance\">compared with our 2024\nsurvey</a> (Claude and Cursor are\nnotable exceptions), but due to a methodology change, this is not an\napples-to-apples comparison. It is, however, plausible that developers are\n&ldquo;shopping around&rdquo; less than they were when these tools were first released,\nresulting in more people using a single assistant for most of their work.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"When writing Go code, which AI\nassistants or agents have you used in the last month?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/ai_asst.svg\" /></p>\n<p>We also asked about overall satisfaction with AI-powered development tools. A\nmajority (55%) reported being satisfied, but this was heavily weighted towards\nthe &ldquo;Somewhat satisfied&rdquo; category (42%) vs. the &ldquo;Very satisfied&rdquo; group (13%).\nRecall that Go itself consistently shows a 90%+ satisfaction rate each year;\nthis year, 62% of respondents said they are &ldquo;Very satisfied&rdquo; with Go. We add\nthis context to show that while AI-powered tooling is starting to see adoption\nand finding some successful use cases, developer sentiment  towards them\nremains much softer than towards more established tooling (among Go\ndevelopers, at least).</p>\n<p>What is driving this lower rate of satisfaction? In a word: quality. We asked\nrespondents to tell us something good they&rsquo;ve accomplished with these tools,\nas well as something that didn&rsquo;t work out well. A majority said that creating\nnon-functional code was their primary problem with AI developer tools (53%),\nwith 30% lamenting that even working code was of poor quality. The most\nfrequently cited benefits, conversely, were generating unit tests, writing\nboilerplate code, enhanced autocompletion, refactoring, and documentation\ngeneration. These appear to be cases where code quality is perceived as less\ncritical, tipping the balance in favor of letting AI take the first pass at a\ntask. That said, respondents also told us the AI-generated code in these\nsuccessful cases still required careful review (and often, corrections), as it\ncan be buggy, insecure, or lack context.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m never satisfied with code quality or consistency, it never follows the\npractices I want to.&rdquo; <span class=\"quote_source\">\u2014 [no satisfaction\nresponse] / 3 \u2013 10 years / Financial services</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;All AI tools tend to hallucinate quickly when working with medium-to-large\ncodebases (10k+ lines of code). They can explain code effectively but\nstruggle to generate new, complex features&rdquo; <span class=\"quote_source\">\u2014 Somewhat satisfied / 3 \u2013 10 years /\nRetail and consumer goods</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Despite numerous efforts to make it write code in an established codebase,\nit would take too much effort to steer it to follow the practices in the\nproject, and it would add subtle behaviour paths - i.e. if it would miss\nsome method it would try to find its way around it or rely on some side\neffect. Sometimes those things are hard to recognize during code review. I\nalso found it mentally taxing to review ai generated code and that overhead\nkills the productivity potential in writing code.&rdquo; <span class=\"quote_source\">\u2014 Very satisfied / 10+ years / Technology</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img alt=\"Overall, how satisfied or dissatisfied\nhave you felt while working with your AI-powered development tools during the\npast month?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/ai_csat.svg\" /></p>\n<p>When we asked developers what they used these tools for, a pattern emerged\nthat is consistent with these quality concerns. The tasks with most adoption\n(green in the chart below) and least resistance (red) deal with bridging\nknowledge gaps, improving local code, and avoiding toil. The frustrations that\ndevelopers talk about with code-generating tools were much less evident when\nthey&rsquo;re seeking information, like how to use a specific API or configure test\ncoverage, and perhaps as a result, we see higher usage of AI in these areas.\nAnother spot that stood out was <em>local</em> code review and related suggestions\n\u2014 people were less interested in using AI to review other people&rsquo;s code\nthan in reviewing their own. Surprisingly, &ldquo;testing code&rdquo; showed lower AI\nadoption than other toilsome tasks, though we don&rsquo;t yet have strong\nunderstanding of why.</p>\n<p>Of all the tasks we asked about, &ldquo;Writing code&rdquo; was the most bifurcated, with\n66% of respondents already or hoping to soon use AI for this, while \u00bc of\nrespondents didn&rsquo;t want AI involved at all. Open-ended responses suggest\ndevelopers primarily use this for toilsome, repetitive code, and continue to\nhave concerns about the quality of AI-generated code.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"How are you using AI-powered\ntools with Go today?\" class=\"chart\" src=\"https://go.dev/blog/survey2025/ai_tools_what.svg\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"closing\">Closing</h2>\n<p>Once again, a tremendous thank-you to everyone who responded to this year&rsquo;s Go\nDeveloper Survey!</p>\n<p>We plan to share the raw survey dataset in Q1 2026, so the larger community\ncan also explore the data underlying these findings. This will only include\nresponses from people who opted in to share this data (82% of all\nrespondents), so there may be some differences from the numbers we reference\nin this post.</p>\n<h2 id=\"methodology\">Survey methodology</h2>\n<p>This survey was conducted between Sept 9 - Sept 30, 2025. Participants were\npublicly invited to respond via the Go Blog, invitations on social media\nchannels (including Bluesky, Mastodon, Reddit, and X), as well as randomized\nin-product invitations to people using VS Code and GoLand to write Go\nsoftware. We received a total of 7,070 responses. After data cleaning to\nremove bots and other very low quality responses, 5,379 were used for the\nremainder of our analysis. The median survey response time was between 12\n\u2013 13 minutes.</p>\n<p>Throughout this report we use charts of survey responses to provide supporting\nevidence for our findings. All of these charts use a similar format. The title\nis the exact question that survey respondents saw. Unless otherwise noted,\nquestions were multiple choice and participants could only select a single\nresponse choice; each chart&rsquo;s subtitle will tell the reader if the question\nallowed multiple response choices or was an open-ended text box instead of a\nmultiple choice question. For charts of open-ended text responses, a Go team\nmember read and manually categorized all of the responses. Many open-ended\nquestions elicited a wide variety of responses; to keep the chart sizes\nreasonable, we condensed them to a maximum of the top 10-12 themes, with\nadditional themes all grouped under &ldquo;Other&rdquo;. The percentage labels shown in\ncharts are rounded to the nearest integer (e.g., 1.4% and 0.8% will both be\ndisplayed as 1%), but the length of each bar and row ordering are based on the\nunrounded values.</p>\n<p>To help readers understand the weight of evidence underlying each finding, we\nincluded error bars showing the 95% <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">confidence\ninterval</a> for responses;\nnarrower bars indicate increased confidence. Sometimes two or more responses\nhave overlapping error bars, which means the relative order of those responses\nis not statistically meaningful (i.e., the responses are effectively tied).\nThe lower right of each chart shows the number of people whose responses are\nincluded in the chart, in the form &ldquo;n = [number of respondents]&rdquo;.</p>\n</div>\n\n    </div>\n\n    \n    <div

And a vapid post that just said &#8220;Adams sure did write some funny cartoons!&#8221; without really digging into who he was would have been less good as a memorial, both in the sense of truly engaging with him, and in the grubby prosaic sense of having anyone read it. And I am not a good enough writer to write something equally powerful that was limited entirely to his good qualities. The compromise I worked out with myself was to let myself publish, as long as it ended on an overall positive note and emphasized his good qualities.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qe-H!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6965817b-d35a-4202-96a4-b8cbcacb6ef2_859x398.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"Dilbert Death Goal 6.26.16 | A Good Goodbye\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"317.8440046565774\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qe-H!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6965817b-d35a-4202-96a4-b8cbcacb6ef2_859x398.jpeg\" title=\"Dilbert Death Goal 6.26.16 | A Good Goodbye\" width=\"686\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This is my second time having this argument - the first was my <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/08/27/elegy-for-john-mccain/\">Elegy For John McCain</a>, which failed much worse - basically everyone thought it was unfairly negative to him and inappropriate just after his death.

One of Adams&#8217; favorite persuasion topics was what he called &#8220;Two Movies On One Screen&#8221;, where people would come away from the same event with totally different narratives - for example, a Democrat might watch a Trump speech and conclude that Trump had openly and clearly announced his racism, while a Republican watching the same speech might think that Trump had just said something patriotic and hadn&#8217;t mentioned race at all.

You can find his discussion of how Adams &#8220;publicly predicted Ben Carson&#8217;s demise&#8221; after Trump acted out a mocking version of Carson&#8217;s description of getting stabbed in the belt buckle (according to Adams, a masterful example of &#8220;visual persuasion&#8221;).</p><p><strong>Leo continues:</strong></p><blockquote><p>A good example would be spinning a whole tale about him as an &#8216;ivermectin true believer&#8217;, when he was open about his skepticism. if you knew his history with medically-assisted suicide, you&#8217;d know he didn&#8217;t plan on fighting the cancer and only did IVM because his fans begged him.</p></blockquote><p>I half-apologize for this one. </p><p>I didn&#8217;t try to &#8220;spin a whole tale&#8221; about Adams as &#8220;an ivermectin true believer&#8221;. What I said was:</p><p>&#187; &#8220;<em>In 2024, diagnosed with terminal cancer, Adams decided to treat it via ivermectin, according to a protocol recommended by fellow right-wing contrarian Dr. William Makis. This doesn&#8217;t seem to me like a story about a cynic milking right-wingers for the grift. It sounds like a true believer.&#8221;</em></p><p>I stand by that paragraph. I don&#8217;t think someone who was milking right-wingers as a cynical grift would have gone so far as to trust their recommendations on what to take for his cancer. I think Adams became a sincere right-winger, and so was willing to listen to right-wing medical advice.</p><p>But I agree that it was written sloppily and sort of suggests he was an ivermectin true believer. He wasn&#8217;t, and I apologize for that.</p><p>I later realized I didn&#8217;t need to read tea leaves about this - he says, very explicitly, in one of his books, that yes, after getting attacked by too many left-wing trolls, he decided to commit to fully joining the right wing:</p><p><em>&#187; &#8220;If you want to see the world more clearly, avoid joining a tribe. But if you are going to war, leave your clear thinking behind and join a tribe. Trumped joined the Republican tribe to win the presidency. Now I was joining the Trump tribe. For a war against Hillbullies [ie pro-Hillary Clinton bullies]. I was all in.&#8221;</em></p><p><strong>After I made some of these arguments to Leo, he said:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I do think that people who listened to thousands of hours of him speaking off-the-cuff might have a better understanding than someone attempting to gain the same by reading a few of his old blog posts.</p></blockquote><p>This is a fair criticism. I tried listening to a couple of his shows, and they had a different, friendlier tone than his books / interviews / tweets. Arguably Adams thought of formal written communication as a place to do manipulation, and verbal communication as a cozier spot where he could relate to people normally and explain all the manipulation he was doing.</p><p><strong>@Ashwin V <a href=\"https://x.com/omnishwin/status/2012402593180606693\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>If you knew anything about Scott, you would know that he never considered anyone a \"lesser human\" as you've so confidently asserted. He was streaming and trying to pass on his wisdom on his death bed.</p></blockquote><p>This was a response to my claim that Adams &#8220;longed to be a manipulator of lesser humans&#8221;. Several people including Ashwin objected that Adams didn&#8217;t see anyone as lesser, nor think of manipulation as demeaning. For example, <a href=\"https://x.com/nutter_just/status/2012585456026657127\">nutter_just</a>: &#8220;Your error is in thinking you must be a lesser human to be manipulable. My impression was Scott believed everyone was like this even himself which is why he believed self affirmations worked. It&#8217;s you manipulating your dumb self.&#8221;</p><p>Again, I&#8217;ll half-apologize. I regret my exact framing (&#8220;lesser humans&#8221;), which I think was unnecessarily inflammatory since it implies he was sort of thinking in those terms. But I think he was doing a bad thing which requires that on some philosophical level he has to be treating other people as his lessers in an unacceptable way, even if he wasn&#8217;t consciously thinking that they were.</p><p>I think trying to manipulate people is inherently demeaning to the dignity of humankind. Nor is it exonerating to say &#8220;I also manipulate myself&#8221; (even if this is true). For analogy, suppose that Adams was a literal telepathic mind controller. If he used his powers on himself (mind controlling himself to work harder), that sounds like a good lifehack. But if he used his powers to turn everyone else into his zombie slaves, he would be offending the dignity of humankind, and &#8220;I also use my powers on myself!&#8221; would be no excuse.</p><p>There are a thousand edge cases, complications, things that are sort of manipulation but not quite, and ways that some of those things might be permissible for the greater good. But none of them change the fact that in the simplest and most typical of cases, like the telepathic mind controller with his zombie slaves, manipulation is wrong.</p><p>One might object that there are simple, typical cases on the other side too. When a job candidate shaves, dresses nicely, and gives a firm handshake, this is in some sense &#8220;manipulating&#8221; the interviewer, since it&#8217;s an attempt to influence his decision through some channel other than facts. I can&#8217;t draw a perfect bright line here between the good and the bad cases, but I would apply tests like &#8220;is this an attempt to more effectively convey true information?&#8221; (eg when I shave, it conveys that I&#8217;m capable of remembering to shave and care a lot about the interview), &#8220;is this something where failing to do the thing would also convey even more information?&#8221; (eg if I didn&#8217;t shave, it would falsely suggest I really didn&#8217;t want the job), and &#8220;is this something where the target has basically given implied consent to this level of manipulation&#8221; (eg the interviewer wants and even hopes that people will dress nicely for the interview).</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r4fL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d643c5f-b24c-4f01-baad-963686d680da_560x174.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"Dilbert: How Not to Answer in a Graduate Job Interview\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"174\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r4fL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d643c5f-b24c-4f01-baad-963686d680da_560x174.jpeg\" title=\"Dilbert: How Not to Answer in a Graduate Job Interview\" width=\"560\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I think some of Adams&#8217; manipulations seem closer to the bad cases than the good ones. He wrote about the moment he decided to use his persuasion powers to convince America to elect Trump. One day when he was doing his dispassionate observer act, he heard about Hillary&#8217;s estate tax plan and realized it would cost his estate lots of money. He had no particular principled stance against it (&#8220;You can argue whether an estate tax is fair or unfair, but fairness is an argument for idiots and children&#8221;) but concluded that:</p><blockquote><p>This was personal. This was also the day I decided to move from observer to persuader. Until then I was happy to simply observe and predict. But once Clinton announced her plans to use government force to rob me on my deathbed, it was war. Persuasion war.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Accepting for the sake of argument that Adams&#8217; persuasive powers are as impressive as he thinks, he manipulated thousands of people who might have stood to benefit from an estate tax, or who sincerely believed in fairness-based arguments for an estate tax, to vote against their own interests/beliefs, in order to enrich him personally<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a>. I think this requires some sort of standpoint where you consider their agency and interests less important than your own, and that&#8217;s why I described him as wanting to manipulate &#8220;lesser humans&#8221;.</p><p>This coexists with him often being very nice, with many people saying his podcast helped them become better people, etc.</p><p><strong>@janiesaysyay <a href=\"https://x.com/janiesaysyay/status/2012899947235119515\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>This essay is a great demonstration of the kind of leftist, myopic thinking Scott [Adams] was fighting.<br /><br />This is how [Alexander] describes [Coffee With Scott Adams], one of the most influential online shows:<br /><br />&#187; <em>\"I had been vaguely aware that he had some community  around him, but on the event of his death, I tried watching an episode or two of his show.

But Adams was telling his readers there was &#8220;a good chance&#8221; that &#8220;they&#8221; would be dead within a year, which I think implies this fate happening to a significant proportion of ordinary Republicans, not just one prominent person. Also, Kirk was five years after the comment was posted.</p><p>Can we dismiss this as a joke? I think Adams has used the manipulation technique of saying things that might or might not be jokes and then strategically sticking to them or saying &#8220;What? Me? I was only joking! Haha! You can&#8217;t take a joke!&#8221; depending on which was more convenient to him at that exact second, enough times that I&#8217;m not comfortable letting him have that escape.</p><p>Also, when I was replying to Joel Pollak about this, I happened to glance at his Twitter account, and one of the top tweets was a repost of someone saying that &#8220;The Democrat playbook is to arrest every single person who disagrees with them&#8221;. I think if I forced Pollak into some kind of extremely literal frame of mind - maybe asked him to bet money on whether I could tweet the words &#8220;the Democrats are wrong about immigration&#8221; in my Democrat-controlled state without getting arrested - he would admit that, okay, they don&#8217;t want to arrest literally every single person who disagrees with them. He was exaggerating for effect, probably in much the way he&#8217;s going to say that Scott Adams was exaggerating for effect. You say stuff like &#8220;The Democrats are going to HUNT YOU DOWN and LITERALLY MURDER YOU. They will TORTURE YOUR FAMILY and RAPE YOUR DAUGHTER and EAT YOUR PETS and TURN YOUR HOUSE INTO A CHURCH OF SATAN&#8221;, and what you mean is &#8220;I disagree with the Democrats and sometimes they go overboard cancelling people&#8221;.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KA_U!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2cb6162-0262-4c4c-8048-e8355f38967a_900x280.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"Comic for 2020-09-23\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"212.17777777777778\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KA_U!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2cb6162-0262-4c4c-8048-e8355f38967a_900x280.gif\" title=\"Comic for 2020-09-23\" width=\"682\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I have a post called <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/if-its-worth-your-time-to-lie-its\">If It&#8217;s Worth Your Time To Lie, It&#8217;s Worth My Time To Correct It</a>. My thesis is that tolerating claims of &#8220;directional correctness&#8221; - the thing where someone asks to get a pass because even if they said wasn&#8217;t <em>literally</em> true, it &#8220;points to&#8221; an &#8220;emotionally correct&#8221; thing - is eventually totally corrosive. It means everyone ratchets up their claims to the highest level they think they can get away with (ie walk back later if challenged, as a motte and bailey). And then you end up with this miasma where maybe 5% of people totally believe you, and 50% of people sort of absorb the connotation and think something like that is true, and then people get terrified of the Democrats and think of them as monsters and treat politics as an existential struggle where they will genuinely get arrested or murdered unless they do it to the Democrats first, and then you get a civil war or something. I think Adams and Pollak&#8217;s milieu has in fact reached this point, and their love for these kinds of exaggerations is a big part of the cause.</p><p>Adams was one of the funniest people in the world. If he was actually telling a joke, you could tell by the fact that you were laughing hysterically. &#8220;Democrats will hunt and kill you&#8221; isn&#8217;t funny. I&#8217;ll refrain from judgment about whether it was Adams&#8217; sincerely held belief, some kind of annoying manipulation attempt, or whether Adams even recognized a difference between the two. But I think judging him on the fact that it didn&#8217;t happen is completely within bounds.</p><p>&#8230;</p><h2>3: Comments On The Substance Of The Piece</h2><p>&#8230;</p><p><strong>Zanzibar BuckBuck McFate <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-dilbert-afterlife/comment/201016268\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>This business where boomers are tolerant of contradictions and find them amusing whereas millennials are horrified is a dynamic I've noticed as well, it seems to be true in politics also, I myself feel this hunger to be authentic all the time. I think it has something to do with the difficulty children have in putting negativity in context. They can't distinguish between a parent having a bad day and venting, or having an existential crisis. So the 50s guy was half right - you don't have to love your boss in your heart of hearts but careful what you say to your kids.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Feral Finster <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-dilbert-afterlife/comment/200694520\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p><em>&#187; &#8220;This is the basic engine of Dilbert: everyone is rewarded in exact inverse proportion to their virtue.

The P.H.B. is neither smart nor industrious, so he is forever on top, reaping the rewards of everyone else&#8217;s toil.

Rao formulated his Gervais Principle as a specific response to Adams&#8217; Dilbert Principle, which I guess means Rao thought Adams got it wrong. Did he?</p><p>The Pointy Haired Boss seems to go back and forth between Clueless and Sociopath, which is probably why Rao thought Adams&#8217; work fell short. Dogbert is clearly Sociopath, but has no permanent role in the corporation, and doesn&#8217;t really represent a real thing you can be - his character was a ridiculous scammer who succeeded at near-impossible endeavours (like convincing people he was a Nostradamus-style mystical prophet) because the logic of the strip demanded it. Later, Adams foregrounded the CEO character more, maybe to create a purer Sociopath, letting the Boss go closer to Clueless. </p><p>This is making me somewhat regret accusing Adams of wanting to be the Pointy-Haired Boss. It would have been fairer (and less of an accusation/surprise) to accuse him of wanting to be Dogbert. But again, Dogbert doesn&#8217;t represent a real thing you could be, which might have been why the PHB made a better metaphor.</p><p>(contra my claim, the cover of <em>Win Bigly</em> shows a mashup of Dogbert and Trump.

I didn&#8217;t expect that, let me tell you.</p></blockquote><p>Several people interpreted me as attacking nerds. I disagree - I think I was attacking <em>self-hating</em> nerds, because nerdiness is fine and you shouldn&#8217;t have to hate yourself for it. To spell it out more explicitly:</p><p>All nerds must eventually realize they&#8217;re not going to immediately dominate everything by intellect alone. This isn&#8217;t because intellect isn&#8217;t great, it&#8217;s because 1) it&#8217;s only one of many skills, and 2) you probably aren&#8217;t even the person with the most intellect. Again, every mildly-talented person has to face this realization, whether it&#8217;s a nerd realizing he won&#8217;t be the next Einstein or a jock realizing he won&#8217;t be the next LeBron.</p><p>If someone deals with this using denial (one of Freud&#8217;s maladaptive defenses), you get the nerd who says no, I really <em>am</em> the next Einstein, ie a crackpot, aka the sort of person who gets featured on Sneerclub. If they deal with it using reaction formation (another of Freud&#8217;s maladaptive defenses), you get the self-hating nerd, aka the sort of person who <em>joins</em> Sneerclub<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a>.</p><p>If they just deal with it maturely instead of spinning up maladaptive defenses against it, they&#8217;re a nerd who is hopefully good-natured and accepting of their nerdiness, and hopefully does some good work in some specific small area, and changes the world in some specific small way (or some very large way, if they can work together with other people and get lucky).</p><p><strong>Bugmaster <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-dilbert-afterlife/comment/200783867\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I think Adams is basically correct. Yes, facts and evidence do exist and are real; but they have virtually no impact on anything socially important -- i.e., on anything important whatsoever. Memes and charisma and persuasion are what matters if you want to achieve life goals that extend beyound yourself and your immediate family.</p></blockquote><p>I worry that Adams (and you) are doing something where unless the average person can solve every problem by facts and intelligence alone, then facts+intelligence lose and memes and persuasion win. But the average person also can&#8217;t solve every problem by memes+persuasion alone!</p><p>If Dilbert is an 80th percentile nerd, the 80th percentile persuader is - I don&#8217;t know, a used-car salesman? Dilbert&#8217;s probably earning more money, especially nowadays when he could make L5 at Google.</p><p>And if Donald Trump is a 99.9999th percentile persuader, the 99.9999th percentile nerd is Ilya Sutskever. Probably most people would slightly prefer being Trump to Sutskever, but Sutksever does have a couple billion dollars, plus the more ethereal rewards of genius; it still seems like a pretty good deal.</p><p>I also think you&#8217;re doing a sort of black-and-white thinking here. Every day, great persuaders like Sam Bankman-Fried and Elizabeth Holmes end up in jail, because in fact the things that they said were true were not true. Every day, smooth-talking charismatic manipulators successfully seduce the girl into bed with them, then totally fail to turn it into a happy stable marriage, because after a few years even the dumbest woman catches on and figures out whether her mate provides real value or not. Even Donald Trump has only a 37% approval rating, because he can&#8217;t make &#8220;we should alienate our allies over Greenland&#8221; sound plausible to most of the American people. When someone&#8217;s very good at it, persuasion <em>sometimes</em> helps them blur facts around the edges. But that&#8217;s it.</p><p>Nobody except Scott Adams and a few psychotherapists ever go to hypnotist school. Most don&#8217;t even go to any formal persuasion classes. That&#8217;s because hypnotism/persuasion isn&#8217;t really a lifehack that helps you win all the time at everything. If the world&#8217;s best hypnotist asked a room of VCs for money with a stupid business plan, he would probably fail.</p><p>This isn&#8217;t to say persuasion is useless, and in certain fields it can be very powerful indeed. But let&#8217;s not go crazy and start worshipping it. The grass is always greener on the other side. The nerd sits in his cubicle and thinks &#8220;If only I were more charismatic.&#8221; But the salesman with the bright teeth and the firm handshake thinks &#8220;Man, I bet I could get out of this dead-end job if only I were smarter.&#8221;<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a></p><p>&#8230;</p><h2>4: The Part On Race And Cancellation (INCLUDED UNDER PROTEST)</h2><p>&#8230;</p><p><strong>Ilya Lozovsky <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-dilbert-afterlife/comment/200690507\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Ninety percent of this essay is brilliant &#8212; smarter and realer than anything anyone else has written about Adams &#8212; but the end lost me.

And I would say, based on the current way things are going, the best advice I would give to white people is to get the hell away from black people. Just get the f**k away. Wherever you have to go. Just get away. Cause there&#8217;s no fixing this. This can&#8217;t be fixed. You just have to escape. </p><p>That&#8217;s what I did. I went to a neighborhood with a very low black population.

So even Don Lemon sees a big difference, for your quality of living, based on where you live and who&#8217;s there. </p><p>So I think it makes no sense whatsoever as a white citizen of America to try to help black citizens anymore. It doesn&#8217;t make sense. Because there&#8217;s no longer a rational impulse. And so I&#8217;m&#8230; I&#8217;m gonna, uh, I&#8217;m gonna back off from being helpful to black America, because it doesn&#8217;t seem like it pays off. Like I&#8217;ve been doing it all my life, and I&#8217;ve been&#8230; the only outcome is I get called a racist. That&#8217;s the only outcome. [cackles] It makes no sense to help black Americans if you&#8217;re white&#8230; it&#8217;s over. Don&#8217;t even think it&#8217;s worth trying. Totally not trying.</p></blockquote><p>Is this racist?</p><p>I have a piece called <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/06/21/against-murderism/\">Against Murderism</a>, where I talk about why it&#8217;s so hard for people to agree on questions about &#8220;racism&#8221;. The summary: although it would be possible to have someone be purely, axiomatically racist - having it be a premise of their reasoning that they hate black people - in practice few people are like this. More typically, people have some argument more like:</p><ol><li><p>I don&#8217;t like [specific bad thing]</p></li><li><p>Minorities are more likely to have [specific bad thing]</p></li><li><p>Therefore I like minorities less than whites.</p></li></ol><p>You can&#8217;t argue with (1), because the bad thing might be something like &#8216;crime&#8217;, which everyone dislikes. You can&#8217;t argue with (2), because sometimes you can find statistics showing it&#8217;s literally true. Your ability to argue with (3) depends on the exact form, but some forms - like &#8220;if I knew nothing about two neighborhoods except that one were 100% black and the other 100% white, I would probably prefer to live in the 100% white one&#8221; - seem pretty strong. But then what&#8217;s left of being against racism?</p><p>We could think of racism as a bias that makes people update on racial topics far beyond what the data allow.  For example, if 0.1% of whites are murderers, and 0.2% of blacks are murderers, this hardly means that you can&#8217;t be nice to your white-collar Harvard-educated black colleague, or that you should think of him as a potential-murderer-in-waiting. But even this might be giving the racists too much credit. If 0.1% of whites are murderers, and 0.2% of blacks are murderers, does that mean you should make a Twitter account NGGRKILLER1488 who posts &#8220;u look like CHIMP i will enjoy murdering ur family during the race war&#8221; under every picture of a black person that comes across your timeline? No? Because a lot of people do do that! </p><p>I&#8217;m not Language Czar, but if you force me to define the word &#8220;racism&#8221;<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" target=\"_self\">6</a>, I would call it a bias which makes people take the flaw of an ethnic group (whether real or imagined) further than they would normally go, until whatever core of useful insight they contained becomes caricatured and exaggerated, and they&#8217;re being used more to spread hatred and fear than to communicate useful information. None of this is original or interesting, and I&#8217;m only saying this cliched and obvious thing so we&#8217;re all on the same page.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qhD3!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7308f73e-7d75-48e2-b0cb-14ecbc1f9cd8_900x280.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"Comic for 2015-07-13\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"218.4\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qhD3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7308f73e-7d75-48e2-b0cb-14ecbc1f9cd8_900x280.gif\" title=\"Comic for 2015-07-13\" width=\"702\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>So was Adams&#8217; comment racist in this sense? By now we can probably rehearse the arguments of both sides:</p><blockquote><p><strong>LIBERAL:</strong> &#8220;It&#8217;s Okay To Be White&#8221; is a known 4chan white supremacist slogan. They chose it as their slogan precisely so it would be awkward when people called them out for saying it, and so they could retreat to saying &#8220;We just said it was okay to be white, which surely nobody can hold against us&#8221;. This is stupid, we&#8217;re under no obligation to pretend we don&#8217;t know this, and those 26% of black people who were against it, were against it on this basis. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>CONSERVATIVE: </strong>Yeah, but the poll didn&#8217;t ask &#8220;do you agree with it as a 4chan white supremacist slogan?&#8221;, it just asked about the statement. And besides, most random Americans don&#8217;t even know the latest 4chan white supremacist slogans. At least some of the respondents probably meant it literally.</p></blockquote><p>My opinion - it seems plausible to me that many of the 26% of respondents who said they disagreed meant they disagreed with the 4chan slogan version, and that many of the rest were doing <a href=\"https://www.juliansanchez.com/2009/08/03/symbolic-belief/\">&#8220;symbolic belief&#8221;</a>/<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RmCjazjupRGcHSm5N/professing-and-cheering\">&#8221;emotive responding&#8221;</a> such that they interpreted the question as something like &#8220;in the history of interactions between the white race and other races, do you believe the white race has behaved in an okay way?&#8221;, and that some of the ones left over were <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/12/noisy-poll-results-and-reptilian-muslim-climatologists-from-mars/\">Lizardmen</a>. </p><p>Adams isn&#8217;t required to know all of the weird sorts of symbolic belief biases that affect polls (although isn&#8217;t &#8220;our responses aren&#8217;t based on factual beliefs, but constantly malleable based on frame and emotion&#8221; sort of his entire shtick?). But at this point, he had lived in the USA for 60 years. He had already had many interactions with black people, both personally and through the news. Given how much other information he had, updating from one ambiguous poll where 26% of people gave an ambiguously bad answer, to &#8220;this entire ethnic group of 30 million people is a hate group, and white people should flee them, and try to avoid all interaction with them, and shouldn&#8217;t help them in any way&#8221; is exactly the sort of caricatured exaggerated<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-7\" id=\"footnote-anchor-7\" target=\"_self\">7</a> leaping-to-conclusions that the word &#8220;racism&#8221; means if it means anything at all<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-8\" id=\"footnote-anchor-8\" target=\"_self\">8</a>. </p><p>Does that mean Adams should have been cancelled and lost his livelihood?

I think it&#8217;s a dumb opinion, and maybe a bit evil in the complicated sense where it&#8217;s hard to disentangle evil from ignorance.

Think a lot of what you say is valid but have to admit I&#8217;m one of the people whose lives he changed for the better. When I first listened I was a 25 year old 3x college dropout and 10 years later I have a great career and family. A lot of that comes from applying his advice. Subjectively I&#8217;ll always love him because of what he gave me, without even knowing who I am. [What helped the most were] the reframes and micro lessons. Almost everyday at work or home there&#8217;s a situation where one pops into my head:</p><ul><li><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not anxious, I&#8217;m excited&#8221;</p></li><li><p>&#8220;laziness is caused by thinking about the cost instead of the pay off&#8221;</p></li><li><p>&#8220;systems are better than goals&#8221;</p></li></ul><p>The main idea, that by changing my thoughts I can change my reality, is simple but went a long way for me. It opened up my imagination to what&#8217;s possible and made my thinking more positive.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Cinna the Poet <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-dilbert-afterlife/comment/200707370\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>To share a different perspective on Adams, my uncle was an avid follower. He went from being a principled libertarian whose ideas I respected very much to (I&#8217;m sad to say) an alt right bigot. Under the influence of Adams, he had no interest anymore in objective truth or the actual scientific method. Reality was all a matter of spin and &#8220;persuasion.&#8221;</p><p>The phrase &#8220;post truth&#8221; gets thrown around too much, but Adams fit that description perfectly.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Alex Poterack <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-dilbert-afterlife/comment/200643606\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>I just need to note you&#8217;re not the only one who read every Dilbert book before graduating elementary school. I&#8217;m the other one.</p></blockquote><p>Dozens of people chimed in, here and on social media, to say they did this too. </p><p><strong>Alyssa Briggs <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-dilbert-afterlife/comment/201544648\">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>This is a great article, but you left out that he handed out king-sized candy bars on Halloween. He will be very missed by the local kiddos.</p></blockquote><p>&#8230;</p><h2>6: Summary/Updates</h2><p>&#8230;</p><p>This was a tough post to write, and I think many people will continue to find it unfair.</p><p>For example, I claimed that Adams said he joined Team Trump because he didn&#8217;t want to pay Hillary&#8217;s proposed estate tax - and that he said he didn&#8217;t care whether the estate tax was unfair or not, he just personally hated the idea of losing money.</p><p>But an Adams backer could justly point out that a few sentences later, he <em>does</em> talk about how it&#8217;s unfair to make him pay an estate tax when he worked hard his whole life. And then a few paragraphs later, he gives a different, more sympathetic story about how he thought Hillary supporters were bullies and it was important to stand up to them (although he then says maybe Trump supporters were exactly equal bullies, but he selfishly was more against the bullies who were bullying <em>him - </em>but then elsewhere he says no, the Hillary supporters&#8217; bullying was worse.)</p><p>Adams keeps trying to eat his cake and have it too. He gives one prosocial altruistic explanation (so that if someone accuses him of being selfish, he can show they&#8217;re wrong), and then one amoral selfish explanation (so that if someone argues with him about whether it&#8217;s <em>really</em> altruistic to oppose estate taxes for millionaires, he can say &#8220;Ha, you can&#8217;t get me, I already admitted I&#8217;m a cold hard realist who doesn&#8217;t worry about that kind of fuzzy stuff.&#8221;) This is much like how he first said Donald Trump was amazing (but didn&#8217;t endorse him), then said he was endorsing Hillary Clinton (but only for his own safety), then endorsed libertarian Gary Johnson (???), then when it looked like Trump would win again walked it back and said obviously he had really been for Trump the whole time. If someone else had won, he would have spun a story where his endorsement of them had been real. He admits all of this!</p><p>So someone who is charitably inclined to Adams can tell a story where he&#8217;s a great predictor, has always done everything for good patriotic altruistic reasons, and only teaches persuasion so that people can better understand themselves and their world. Someone who is uncharitably inclined can tell a different story where his predictions are mostly wrong, he does everything for selfish reasons, and uses persuasion to manipulate others and enrich himself.</p><p>I usually try to err on the side of charity. But Adams is wearing a metaphorical &#8220;I AM GOING TO USE YOUR CHARITABLE INSTINCTS TO MANIPULATE YOU&#8221; t-shirt. So I&#8217;m happy to suspend charity in this case and judge him on some kind of average of his conflicting statements, or even to default to the less-advantageous one to make sure he can&#8217;t get away with it.</p><p>So here are the updates I made based on your comments:</p><ol><li><p>Adams wasn&#8217;t an ivermectin true believer, and although my piece very narrowly avoided saying that he was, I should have been clearer about this and avoided implying it.</p></li><li><p>Adams&#8217; manipulation coexisted with his being a nice person who cared about others. I shouldn&#8217;t have described him thinking of his manipulation targets as &#8220;lesser humans&#8221; in a way that implied this was a conscious thought, as opposed to (as I claim) a background stance his actions indirectly implied.</p></li><li><p>Adams&#8217; podcast was a bigger deal than I thought, and many people thought it seriously improved their lives. I should have concentrated more on this.</p></li></ol><p></p><div class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-anchor-1\" id=\"footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Adams does try to defend this, saying that &#8220;I earned my money through hard work, and I already paid taxes on it,&#8221; but I don&#8217;t understand what he means by saying this just a few sentences after he says that you shouldn&#8217;t debate fairness because that&#8217;s for children, and in that context it doesn&#8217;t really feel very exonerating.</p></div></div><div class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-anchor-2\" id=\"footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>In December, it was #67, so it may have gotten a small publicity bump from Adams&#8217; death, but only a small one.</p></div></div><div class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-anchor-3\" id=\"footnote-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>This is probably unfairly low because it has its own website and doesn&#8217;t rely on YouTube subscriptions.

First, I think this has no relationship to the poll Adams&#8217; was citing, so now we&#8217;re really steelmanning him. But second, this is still a super-low-res caricature. I&#8217;ve lived in plurality-black neighborhoods twice in my life, and although they had their problems I never felt afraid for my life. I assume there is some much worse 99% black horribly poor ghetto where I would feel afraid for my life, but I also imagine there are some horribly poor 99%-white towns where <em>blacks</em> feel afraid for their lives, and the difference between &#8220;if you&#8217;re white, have some prudence about living in the horribly poor 99% black ghetto&#8221; vs. &#8220;blacks are a hate group and you should flee from them&#8221; is the difference between good justifiable reasoning and racism. I&#8217;m fine with admitting that we tolerate low-res-caricature unsophisticated statements on other topics in a way that we don&#8217;t tolerate them on race, but different topics suggest different levels of caution (if you asked me where the kidney is, I would answer with different levels of sophistication depending on whether you were curious vs. about to perform surgery), a country where 25% of the population is chomping at the bit for race war is a place where you should use high sophistication for race-related statements (and yes, I agree that woke people also fail at this and are blameworthy), and the word for when people in that particular country instead use culpably low-resolution and unsophisticated statements is &#8220;racism&#8221;, and although in general I try not to use it so I don&#8217;t have to get into interminable debates like this one, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s wrong to use it here.</p></div></div><div class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-anchor-9\" id=\"footnote-9\" target=\"_self\">9</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Although I don&#8217;t think Adams&#8217; cancellation was fair according to normal human logic, I think it had a certain odd sort of cosmic justice. 4chan&#8217;s deployment of the &#8220;It&#8217;s Okay To Be White&#8221; slogan was (maybe literally) out of Adams&#8217; book - say something completely inoffensive, make sure everyone knows it has a secret offensive meaning, then retreat back to &#8220;What?

My understanding is that custom commands already exist if you want to create them, but reducing levels of friction, including levels of friction in reducing levels of friction, is often highly valuable. A way to browse skills and interact with the files easily, or see and manage your connectors, or an easy interface for defining new commands, seems great.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Obsidian</h4>\n\n\n<p>I highly recommend using Obsidian or another similar tool together with Claude Code. This gives you a visual representation of all the markdown files, and lets you easily navigate and search and edit them, and add more and so on. I think it\u2019s well worth keeping it all human readable, where that human is you.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/arscontexta/status/2013655662752862360\">Heinrich calls it \u2018vibe note taking</a>\u2019 whether or not you use Obsidian.

Claude\u2019s evaluation is that this could be good if you\u2019re working in codebases where you need to continuously learn things, but the overhead and risk of clutter are real.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/jasminewsun/status/2012252234831266179\">Jasmine Sun created a tool</a> to <a href=\"https://t.co/RBOQJloZEg\">turn any YouTube podcast into a clean, grammatical PDF transcript with chapters and takeaways</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tool Search</h4>\n\n\n<p>The big change with Claude Code version 2.1.7 was <a href=\"https://x.com/ClaudeCodeLog/status/2011230548572651853\">enabled MCP tool search auto mode by default</a>, which triggers when MCP tools are more than 10% of the context window. You can disable this by adding \u2018MCPSearch\u2019 to \u2018disallowedTools\u2019 in settings. This seems big for people using a lot of MCPs at once, which could eat a lot of context.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thariq (Anthropic): \u200bToday we\u2019re rolling out MCP Tool Search for Claude Code.</p>\n<p>As MCP has grown to become a more popular protocol and agents have become more capable, we\u2019ve found that MCP servers may have up to 50+ tools and take up a large amount of context.</p>\n<p>Tool Search allows Claude Code to dynamically load tools into context when MCP tools would otherwise take up a lot of context.</p>\n<p><strong>How it works:<br />\n</strong>&#8211; Claude Code detects when your MCP tool descriptions would use more than 10% of context<br />\n&#8211; When triggered, tools are loaded via search instead of preloaded</p>\n<p>Otherwise, MCP tools work exactly as before. This resolves one of our most-requested features on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/7336\">lazy loading for MCP servers</a>. Users were documenting setups with 7+ servers consuming 67k+ tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>If you\u2019re making a MCP server<br />\n</strong>Things are mostly the same, but the \u201cserver instructions\u201d field becomes more useful with tool search enabled. It helps Claude know when to search for your tools, similar to skills</p>\n<p><strong>If you\u2019re making a MCP client<br />\n</strong>We highly suggest implementing the ToolSearchTool, <a href=\"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/tool-search-tool\">you can find the docs here</a>. We implemented it with a custom search function to make it work for Claude Code.</p>\n<p><strong>What about programmatic tool calling?<br />\n</strong>We experimented with doing programmatic tool calling such that MCP tools could be composed with each other via code. While we will continue to explore this in the future, we felt the most important need was to get Tool Search out to reduce context usage.</p>\n<p>Tell us what you think here or on Github as you see the ToolSearchTool work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With that solved, presumably you should be \u2018thinking MCP\u2019 at all times, it is now safe to load up tons of them even if you rarely use each one individually.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Out Of The Box</h4>\n\n\n<p>Well, yes, this is happening.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/bayeslord/status/2011467932618879339\">bayes</a>: everyone 3 years ago: omg what if ai becomes too widespread and then it turns against us with the strategic advantage of our utter and total dependence</p>\n<p>everyone now: hi claude here\u2019s my social security number and root access to my brain i love you please make me rich and happy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some of us three years ago were pointing out, loud and clear, that exactly this was obviously going to happen, modulo various details. Now you can see it clearly.</p>\n<p>Not giving Claude a lot of access is going to slow things down a lot. The only thing holding most people back was the worry things would accidentally get totally screwed up, and that risk is a lot lower now. Yes, obviously this all causes other concerns, including prompt injections, but in practice on an individual level the risk-reward calculation is rather clear. It\u2019s not like Google didn\u2019t effectively have root access to our digital lives already. And it\u2019s not like a truly rogue AI couldn\u2019t have done all these things without having to ask for the permissions.</p>\n<p>The humans are going to be utterly dependent on the AIs in short order, and the AIs are going to have access, collectively, to essentially everything. Grok has root access to Pentagon classified information, so if you\u2019re wondering where we draw the line the answer is there is no line. Let the right one in, and hope there is a right one?</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Skilling Up</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ghumare64/status/2012136491133145364\">What\u2019s better than one agent? Multiple agents</a> that work together and that don\u2019t blow up your budget. Rohit Ghumare offers a guide to this.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rohit Ghumare: Single agents hit limits fast. Context windows fill up, decision-making gets muddy, and debugging becomes impossible. Multi-agent systems solve this by distributing work across specialized agents, similar to how you\u2019d structure a team.</p>\n<p>The benefits are real:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Specialization</strong>: Each agent masters one domain instead of being mediocre at everything</li>\n<li><strong>Parallel processing</strong>: Multiple agents can work simultaneously on independent subtasks</li>\n<li><strong>Maintainability</strong>: When something breaks, you know exactly which agent to fix</li>\n<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Add new capabilities by adding new agents, not rewriting everything</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The tradeoff: coordination overhead. Agents need to communicate, share state, and avoid stepping on each other. Get this wrong and you\u2019ve just built a more expensive failure mode.\u200b</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can do this with a supervisor agent, which scales to about 3-8 agents, if you need quality control and serial tasks and can take a speed hit. To scale beyond that you\u2019ll need hierarchy, the same as you would with humans, which gets expensive in overhead, the same as it does in humans.</p>\n<p>Or you can use a peer-to-peer swarm that communicates directly if there aren\u2019t serial steps and the tasks need to cross-react and you can be a bit messy.</p>\n<p>You can use a shared state and set of objects, or you can pass messages. You also need to choose a type of memory.</p>\n<p>My inclination is by default you should use supervisors and then hierarchy. Speed takes a hit but it\u2019s not so bad and you can scale up with more agents. Yes, that gets expensive, but in general the cost of the tokens is less important than the cost of human time or the quality of results, and you can be pretty inefficient with the tokens if it gets you better results.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/omooretweets/status/2014010732061638949\">Olivia Moore offers a basic guide to Cursor and Claude Code for nontechnical folks.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/SuhailKakar/status/2012858927084699799\">Here\u2019s another Twitter post with basic tips</a>. I need to do better on controlling context and starting fresh windows for each issue, in particular.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/mitchellh/status/2013679011315196144\">Mitchell Hashimoto</a>: It&#8217;s pretty cool that I can tell an agent that CI broke at some point this morning, ask it to use `git bisect` to find the offending commit, and fix it. I then went to the bathroom, talked to some people in the hallway, came back, and it did a swell job.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Often you\u2019ll want to tell the AI what tool is best for the job. Patrick McKenzie points out that even if you don\u2019t know how the orthodox solution works, as long as you know the name of the orthodox solution, <a href=\"https://x.com/patio11/status/2013691269193625604\">you can say \u2018use [X]\u2019 and that\u2019s usually good enough</a>. One place I\u2019ve felt I\u2019ve added a lot of value is when I explain why I believe that a solution to a problem exists, or that a method of some type should work, and then often Claude takes it from there. My taste is miles ahead of my ability to implement.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Art Must Have An End Other Than Itself Or It Collapses Into Infinite Recursion</h4>\n\n\n<p>Always be trying to get actual use out of your setup as you\u2019re improving it. It\u2019s so tempting to think \u2018oh obviously if I do more optimization first that\u2019s more efficient\u2019 but this prevents you knowing what you actually need, and it risks getting caught in an infinite loop.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/deepfates/status/2012984897388859403\">@deepfates</a>: Btw thing you get with claude code is not psychosis either.

Now that Anthropic has figured out how to make dangerous interactions safer, it can actually do the opposite. In contexts where it is safe and appropriate to take action, Claude knows that refusal is not a \u2018safe\u2019 choice, and is happy to help.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/deanwball/status/2011398376093278577\">Dean W. Ball</a>: One underrated fact is that OpenAI\u2019s Codex and Gemini CLI have meaningfully heavier guardrails than Claude Code. These systems have refused many tasks (for example, anything involving research into and execution of investing strategies) that Claude Code happily accepts. Codex/Gemini also seek permission more.</p>\n<p>The conventional narrative is that &#8220;Anthropic is more safety-pilled than the others.&#8221; And it&#8217;s definitely true that Claude is likelier to refuse tasks relating to eg biology research. But overall the current state of play would seem to be that Anthropic is more inclined to let their agents rip than either OAI or GDM.</p>\n<p>My guess is that this comes down to Anthropic creating guardrails principally via a moral/ethical framework, and OAI/GDM doing so principally via lists of rules. But just a guess.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/tyler_m_john/status/2011400602769879223\">Tyler John</a>: The proposed explanation is key. If true, it means that Anthropic&#8217;s big investment in alignment research is paying off by making the model much more usable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Investment strategizing tends to be safe across the board, but there are presumably different lines on where they become unwilling to help you execute. So far, I have not had Claude Code refuse a request from me, not even once.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Code Versus Cowork</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/deanwball/status/2011954423778467874\">Dean W. Ball</a>: My high-level review of Claude Cowork:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It\u2019s probably superior for many users to Claude Code just because of the UI.</li>\n<li>It\u2019s not obviously superior for me, not so much because the command line is such a better UI, but because Opus in Claude Code seems more capable to me than in Cowork. I\u2019m not sure if this is because Code is better as a harness, because the model has more permissive guardrails in Code, or both.</li>\n<li>There are certain UI niceties in Cowork I like very much; for example, the ability to leave a comment or clarification on any item in the model\u2019s active to-do list while it is running&#8211;this is the kind of thing that is simply not possible to do nicely within the confines of a Terminal UI.</li>\n<li>Cowork probably has a higher ceiling as a product, simply because a GUI allows for more experimentation. I am especially excited to see GUI innovation in the orchestration and oversight of multi-agent configurations. We have barely scratched the surface here.</li>\n<li>Because of (4), if I had to bet money, I\u2019d bet that within 6-12 months Cowork and similar products will be my default tool for working with agents, beating out the command-line interfaces. But for now, the command-line-based agents remain my default.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I haven\u2019t tried Cowork myself due to the Mac-only restriction and because I don\u2019t have a problem working with the command line. I\u2019ve essentially transitioned into Claude Code for everything that isn\u2019t pure chat, since it seems to be more intelligent and powerful in that mode than it does on the web even if you don\u2019t need the extra functionality.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Claude Cowork Offers Mundane Utility</h4>\n\n\n<p>The joy of the simple things:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/MattBruenig/status/2011895261044621715\">Matt Bruenig</a>: lot of lower level Claude Code use is basically just the recognition that you can kind of do everything with bash and python one-liners, it&#8217;s just no human has the time or will to write them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or to figure out how to write them.</p>\n<p>Enjoying the almost as simple things:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/adocomplete/status/2011194268518662646\">Ado</a>: Here&#8217;s a fun use case for Claude Cowork.</p>\n<p>I was thinking of getting a hydroponic garden. I asked Claude to go through my grocery order history on various platforms and sum up vegetable purchases to justify the ROI.</p>\n<p>Worked like a charm!</p>\n<p>For some additional context:</p>\n<p>&#8211; it looked at 2 orders on each platform (Kroger, Safeway, Instacart)<br />\n&#8211; It extrapolated to get the annual costs from there</p>\n<p>Could have gotten more accurate by downloading order history in a CSV and feeding that to Claude, but this was good enough.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The actual answer is that very obviously it was not worth it for Ado to get a hydroponic garden, because his hourly rate is insanely high, but this is a fun project and thus goes by different standards.</p>\n<p>The transition from Claude Code to Claude Cowork, for advanced users, if you\u2019ve got a folder with the tools then the handoff should be seamless:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u200b<a href=\"https://x.com/ttunguz/status/2011189040591319304\">Tomasz Tunguz</a>: I asked Claude Cowork to read my tools folder. Eleven steps later, it understood how I work.</p>\n<p>Over the past year, I built a personal operating system inside Claude Code : scripts to send email, update our CRM, research startups, draft replies. Dozens of small tools wired together. All of it lived in a folder on my laptop, accessible only through the terminal.</p>\n<p>Cowork read that folder, parsed each script, &amp; added them to its memory. Now I can do everything I did yesterday, but in a different interface. The capabilities transferred. The container didn\u2019t matter.</p>\n<p>My tools don\u2019t belong to the application anymore. They\u2019re portable. In the enterprise, this means laptops given to new employees would have Cowork installed plus a collection of tools specific to each role : the accounting suite, the customer support suite, the executive suite.</p>\n<p>The name choice must have been deliberate. Microsoft trained us on copilot for three years : an assistant in the passenger seat, helpful but subordinate. Anthropic chose cowork. You\u2019re working with someone who remembers how you like things done.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re entering an era where you just tell the computer what to do. Here\u2019s all my stuff. Here are the five things we need to do today. When we need to see something, a chart, a document, a prototype, an interface will appear on demand.</p>\n<p>The current version of Cowork is rough. It\u2019s slow. It crashed twice on startup. It changed the authorization settings for my Claude Code installation. <a href=\"https://tomtunguz.com/thoughts-on-claude-coworker/\">But the promised power is enough to plow through</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/simonw/status/2011570719856214153\">Simon Willison</a>: This is great &#8211; context pollution is why I rarely used MCP, now that it&#8217;s solved there&#8217;s no reason not to hook up dozens or even hundreds of MCPs to Claude Code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/venturetwins/status/2011474999094513881\">Justine Moore has Claude Cowork write up threads</a> on NeurIPS best papers, generate graphics for them on Krea and validate this with ChatGPT.

So tell Claude Code to change that for you by setting cleanupPeriodDays to 0.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/xuenay/status/2013292333710631438\">Kaj Sotala</a>: People were talking about how you can also use Claude Code as a general-purpose assistant for any files on your computer, so I had Claude Code do some stuff like extracting data from a .csv file and rewriting it and putting it into another .csv file</p>\n<p>Then it worked great and then I was like &#8220;it&#8217;s dumb to use an LLM for this, Claude could you give me a Python script that would do the same&#8221; and then it did and then that script worked great</p>\n<p>So uhh I can recommend using Claude Code as a personal assistant for your local files I guess, trying to use it that way got me an excellent non-CC solution</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep. Often the way you ues Claude Code is to notice that you can automate things and then have it automate the automation process. It doesn\u2019t have to do everything itself any more than you do.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/petergyang/status/2011098470757851528\">An explanation</a> (<a href=\"https://t.co/Ggqaa3F11Z\">direct link to 15 minute video</a>) of what Claude skills are.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vibe Coding Requires Good Vibes</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/JI/status/2011207791764283690\">James Ide points out that \u2018vibe coding</a>\u2019 anything serious still requires a deep understanding of software engineering and computer systems. You need to figure out and specify what you want. You need to be able to spot the times it\u2019s giving you something different than you asked for, or is otherwise subtly wrong. Typing source code is dead, but reading source code and the actual art of software engineering are very much not.</p>\n<p>I find the same, and am rapidly getting a lot better at various things as I go.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Codex of Ultimate Vibing</h4>\n\n\n<p>Every\u2019s Dan Shipper writes that <a href=\"https://every.to/chain-of-thought/openai-has-some-catching-up-to-do\">OpenAI has some catching up to do</a>, as his office has with one exception turned entirely to Claude Code with Opus 4.5, where a year ago it would have been all GPT models, and a month prior there would have been a bunch of Codex CLI and GPT 5.1 in Cursor alongside Claude Code.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/LLMJunky/status/2011937820772876430\">Codex did add the ability</a> to instruct mid-execution with new prompts without the need to interrupt the agent (requires /experimental), but Claude Code already did that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/HCSolakoglu/status/2013840420661260574\">There are those who still prefer Codex and GPT-5.2, such as Hasan Can</a>. They are very much in the minority lately, but if you\u2019re a heavy duty coder definitely check and see which option works best for you, and consider potential hybrid strategies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/tyler_m_john/status/2011941906956140780\">One hybrid strategy is that Claude Code can directly call the Gemini CLI,</a> even without an API key. Tyler John reports it is a great workflow, as Gemini can spot things Claude missed and act as a reviewer and way to call out Claude on its mistakes. <a href=\"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli\">Gemini CLI is here.</a></p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">No Soup For You</h4>\n\n\n<p>Contrary to claims by some, including George Hotz, <a href=\"https://x.com/seconds_0/status/2011569723390194074\">Anthropic did not cut off OpenRouter or other similar services from Claude Opus 4.5</a>. The API exists. They can use it.</p>\n<p>What other interfaces cannot do is use the Claude Code authorization token to use the tokens from your Claude subscription for a different service, which was always against Anthropic\u2019s ToS. The subscription is a special deal.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/marcosnils/status/2011600088557121877\">\u200bMarcos Nils</a>: We exchanged postures through DMs but I\u2019m on the other side regarding this matter. Devs knew very well what they were doing while breaking CC\u2019s ToS by spoofing and reverse engineering CC to use the max subscription in unintended ways.</p>\n<p>I think it\u2019s important to separate the waters here:</p>\n<p>&#8211; Could Anthropic\u2019s enforcement have been handled better? sureley, yes<br />\n&#8211; Were devs/users \u201cdeceived\u201d or got a different service for what they paid for? I don\u2019t think so.</p>\n<p>Not only this, it\u2019s even worse than that. OpenCode intentionally knew they were violating Claude ToS by allowing their users to use the max subscription in the first place.</p>\n<p>I guess people just like to complain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I agree that Anthropic\u2019s communications about this could have been better, but what they actually did was tolerate a rather blatant loophole for a while, allowing people to use Claude on the cheap and probably at a loss for Anthropic, which they have now reversed with demand surging faster than they can spin up servers.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Server Overload</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/OpenRouterAI/status/2011229861965414667\">Claude Codes quite a lot, usage is taking off. Here\u2019s OpenRouter</a> (this particular use case might be confounded a bit by the above story where they cut off alternative uses of Claude Code authorization tokens, but I\u2019m guessing mostly it isn\u2019t):</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fKEB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37468a23-121c-4858-b1e2-3ff472bc2914_1043x1719.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/kevinroose/status/2011462601679811013\">A day later, it looked like this</a>.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wphh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2b97bf6-848a-4183-8f3d-e86dc8227f4c_1040x1218.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(January 14, 11:27am eastern): Resolved, should be back to normal now\u200b</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/nummanali/status/2011483316705239338\">Reports are the worst of the outage was due to a service deployment, which took about 4 hours to fix</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Here\u2019s The Pitch</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/aidanshandle/status/2013065085212606831\">aidan</a>: If I were running Claude marketing the tagline would be &#8220;Why not today?&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/omooretweets/status/2013061472407208311\">Olivia Moore</a>: Suddenly seeing lots of paid creator partnerships with Claude</p>\n<p>Many of them are beautifully shot and focused on: (1) building personal software; or (2) deep learning</p>\n<p>The common tagline is \u201cThink more, not less\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She shared a sample TikTok, showing a woman who doesn\u2019t understand math using Claude to automatically code up visualizations to help her understand science, which seemed great.</p>\n<p>OpenAI takes the approach of making things easy on the user and focusing on basic things like cooking or workouts. Anthropic shows you a world where anything is possible and you can learn and engage your imagination. Which way, modern man?</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Lighter Side</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/peterwildeford/status/2012646864332664924\">And yet some people think the AIs won\u2019t be able to take over</a>.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1z3s!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b82c1ab-6e4d-48ab-971a-6fda6dbd23dc_1045x533.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
