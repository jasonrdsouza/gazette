That itself was how it got so big.</p><p>It was called Baseline Drift, which sounded like something that happened to boats when you forget to moor them. It did not sound like something that would reorganize biomedical science, but it did &#8212; specifically, the part that depended on knowing what counted as ordinary.</p><p>Baseline drift meant that nobody could reliably say what a &#8220;normal&#8221; human outcome looked like anymore.</p><p>This was awkward because, until the mid-twenty-first century, biology had relied on a shared set of normative assumptions: how much people should sleep, how fast wounds should heal, how cognition declined with age, how bodies responded to stress, infection, calories, boredom. These weren&#8217;t &#8220;universal&#8221; control groups, of course, because every experiment still had its own controls &#8212; but they were population reference frames, the invisible scaffolding beneath public health guidance, drug approvals, actuarial tables, and phrases like &#8220;clinically meaningful improvement.&#8221;</p><p>It began (depending on whom you asked) around 2025 with the publication of a global guideline on using GLP-1 medicines to help manage obesity. Or 2028, when <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10380460/\">prenatal methylation screens</a> quietly became the standard of care. Or 2031, when <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11316502/\">adaptive lighting systems</a> tuned to circadian biology spread from hospitals to schools to office parks. Or maybe it was 2034, when insurance stopped covering &#8220;general wellness&#8221; supplements because everyone was already getting them through <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-024-00997-w\">food fortification</a>, water treatment, and special perks from their employers.</p><p>In truth, there was no one moment where someone stood up and said, &#8220;We are now enhancing the species.&#8221;</p><p>There was only the slow tide of policies, memos, and social proof.</p><p>By 2040, most children in wealthy countries had received personalized micronutrient profiles before age three. By 2045, gut microbiome calibration was as routine as dental cleaning. By 2050, short-course somatic gene therapies corrected rare metabolic inefficiencies the way eyeglasses once corrected vision. While no single person was wholly optimized on all fronts, such interventions nudged distributions. Means crept upward. Variance narrowed in some places and exploded in others.</p><p>People slept eight-point-two hours instead of the <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2019/04/which-countries-get-the-most-sleep-and-how-much-do-we-really-need/\">six-point-nine</a> that they had in the 2020s. They recovered from illness faster. They aged more slowly, but unevenly, and in unpredictable ways. Cognitive decline no longer followed a singular curve, as it had before the introduction of <a href=\"https://medicine.washu.edu/news/anti-amyloid-drug-shows-signs-of-preventing-alzheimers-dementia/\">anti-amyloid therapies</a>. Neither did pain tolerance, emotional regulation, immune response, or stress recovery.</p><p>Humans were healthier than ever. They were also less similar to one another than they had ever been.</p><p>Differences between rich and poor countries, between drug availability and production standards, between quickly diversifying treatment frameworks, or simply between the marketing prowess of certain doctors over others, made it so that human lifestyle, behavior, and ultimately, human bodies diverged ever more.</p><p>The Institute for Human Reference, whose name sounded more confident than it deserved, was founded in 2053 in a renovated strip mall in Florida. The mall had once housed a Chick-fil-A, a nail salon, and a store selling nothing but phone cases. Now it housed ethicists, statisticians, molecular biologists, policy analysts, and one historian hired to &#8220;provide context,&#8221; which is what someone does when you want them around for optics but don&#8217;t plan to listen to them.</p><p>The Institute&#8217;s mission statement was short and confident: Define the reference human.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://www.asimov.press/subscribe\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>This used to be straightforward. In 2000, it meant &#8220;average diet, average activity, average lifestyle, no diagnosed disease, and no ongoing treatment.&#8221; In 2030, it meant &#8220;no experimental therapies, no known genetic edits.&#8221; By 2053, it meant nothing at all.</p><p>The trouble started with a spreadsheet, as it always does. A junior analyst noticed that participants labeled &#8220;unmodified&#8221; in a longitudinal cognition study were improving faster than those receiving standard nootropic protocols. Not significantly. Just enough to ruin everyone&#8217;s weekend.</p><p>The untreated cohort slept better, learned faster, and healed quicker than expected. They showed lower systemic inflammation, smoother glucose curves, and fewer regrettable opinions online. This was not because the treatments for the positive control group were harmful. It was because both groups were already heavily modified &#8212; often in aberrant, untracked ways. The &#8220;untreated&#8221; participants had benefited from cleaner air, adaptive lighting, fortified diets, stress-moderating urban design, and gut microbiomes optimized by public utilities providers for the bulk of their lives. Their baselines had been lifted, quietly and incrementally, without ever being logged as an intervention.</p><p>It was as if doing nothing had become a performance-enhancing drug.</p><p>The Institute convened a panel. The panel produced a report. And the report produced concern.</p><p>Without stable reference populations, public health science began to fray. Drug trials struggled to generalize. Public health guidelines contradicted one another. Regulators could no longer say whether an effect was meaningful or contextual. And insurance actuaries complained loudly.</p><p>The Institute tried to recruit even more unmodified humans. They advertised discreetly. &#8220;Participants sought,&#8221; the flyers said, &#8220;for a study on human baseline biology.&#8221; This attracted three types of people: conspiracy theorists, survivalists, and men who believed their masculinity was harmed by seat belts.</p><p>None qualified. Every candidate, regardless of how they avoided vaccines or grew their own food, was touched by various environmental enhancements. Their water was cleaner, the nutrients in their seeds higher, and even the air they breathed in the Institute&#8217;s lobby had been <a href=\"https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-death-rays-that-guard-life/\">treated by germicidal ultraviolet light</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the world continued improving.</p><p>Children learned faster, but differently. Each person became a unique bundle of interventions, exposures, and optimizations. Scientists began publishing papers with titles like <em>Toward a Functional Approximation of the Human Baseline and Defining Control Conditions in a Post-Control World</em>. These papers cited one another heavily and meant very little.</p><p>At last, someone proposed manufacturing a baseline.</p><p>Embryos. Archived ones. From before CRISPR, before microbiome engineering, before the Great Vitamin Correction of 2029. They would raise these children in sealed environments, feeding them pre-industrial diets. They would experience no screens, no optimization, and no enhancements except love, which everyone agreed did not count, despite <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3345204/\">all evidence to the contrary</a>.</p><p>The ethicists balked.</p><p>The regulators bristled.</p><p>The grant proposal was rejected, revised, rejected again, and then leaked.</p><p>GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS PRODUCING &#8220;NATURAL&#8221; CHILDREN FOR SCIENCE.</p><p>Public reaction was swift and confused. Some people thought such children would be holy. Others thought they would be monsters or savages. Most people thought the whole thing sounded complicated. A Texas senator said the proposal sounded &#8220;expensive and European.&#8221;</p><p>The project was shuttered.</p><p>The Institute pivoted to simulation. If scientists couldn&#8217;t find a baseline, perhaps they could model one. Perhaps they could reconstruct the unmodified human the way paleontologists reconstructed dinosaurs through fragments and educated guesses. They rented an old data center and built several models of unmodified humans from historical data, archaeological inference, and optimistic assumptions.</p><p>The model was elegant and insightful, but also depressing.</p><p>The simulated baseline humans were less healthy, more impulsive, more violent, and much more likely to believe things that were untrue. When the model was presented at a conference, someone asked whether this meant enhancement was a superior way of life.</p><p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said a statistician, &#8220;it means our assumptions about our ancestors were flattering.&#8221;</p><p>The room laughed politely.</p><p>The Institute issued its final report in 2061. It stated, in careful language, that the concept of an unmodified, &#8220;natural&#8221; human baseline was no longer scientifically meaningful. Humanity had become irreducibly specific, fragmented into trajectories too individualized to be averaged without distortion. Science could no longer pretend that population means governed individual outcomes the way it did before. The failure was not ethical. It was statistical. Averages had stopped converging. The problem was no longer contamination of the baseline, but the disappearance of the conditions under which a baseline would be sufficiently explanatory.</p><p>It didn&#8217;t take long for biomedicine to adapt. <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3118090/\">N=1</a> studies proliferated. <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4830707/\">Rolling baselines</a> replaced fixed controls. Therapies were evaluated against a person&#8217;s own prior state, not some mythical norm. Progress became local, contextual, and <a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315239927-22/genes-public-health-applications-genetic-technology-disease-prevention-muin-khoury\">personal</a>. The 2060s saw the proliferation of some seven billion <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12889-019-7419-4\">digital baselines</a>, with each person becoming the proud representative of their own unique reference group.</p><p>The Institute closed in 2062, its offices converted into a yoga studio. The historian wrote a book that sold poorly but aged well.</p><p>Science continued, because science always does. It simply changed its metrics.</p><p>People went on living longer, thinking more clearly, suffering less, and wondering why they felt so uneasy. Aging people reminisced about the people of yesterday. Ad agencies bemoaned the death of a world where they could appeal to a large target audience. Children asked their parents what humans used to be like.</p><p>&#8220;Worse,&#8221; the parents said.</p><p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you change things quicker?&#8221; the children asked.</p><p>&#8220;Humanity was afraid of changes,&#8221; they said. &#8220;But we kept accepting small improvements and got better over time.&#8221;</p><p>The children &#8212; enhanced in a thousand invisible ways &#8212; went to sleep under lights tuned to their biology, breathing optimized air, dreaming dreams shaped by a history of improvements they did not choose.</p><p>They slept well. That, at least, could be measured.</p><div><hr /></div><p><strong>Eliomer H.

($Vendor) is part of their identity, and since they would have to help roll out and support any changes,\u00a0<strong>we are stuck living in 2015</strong>\u00a0apparently forever.\u201d (What does management have to say?) \u201cIt\u2019s been twenty years since they touched a line of code.\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cWe\u2019re weird in that most of the company hates technology and really hates that we have to pay for it since they don\u2019t understand the value it brings to the company.\u00a0<strong>This is intentional ignorance</strong>, we make the value props continually and well, we just haven\u2019t succeeded yet\u2026.We\u2019re a little obsessed with trying to get champagne quality at Boone\u2019s prices.\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cWhen it comes to dealing with salespeople and the enterprise sales process, the best tip for engineers is to not anthropomorphize sales professionals who are driven by commission. The best ones are like robot lawn mowers dressed in furry unicorn costumes. They may seem cute and nice but they do not care about anything besides closing the next deal\u2026.All of the best SaaS companies are full of these\u00a0<strong>friendly fake unicorn zombies who suck cash</strong>\u00a0instead of blood.\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nearly all of the emails I got were either describing a terminally fucked up buying process from the top down, or the long term consequences of those fucked up decisions.</p>\n<p>In other words: I was writing tactical advice for teams who were surviving in a strategic vacuum.</p>\n<p>So I threw the whole thing out, and started over from scratch. \ud83d\ude2d</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-anchor-post\">Even good teams are struggling right now</h2>\n<p>As Tolstoy once wrote, \u201cHappy teams are all alike; every fucked up team is fucked up in its own precious way.\u201d</p>\n<p>There is an infinity of ways to screw something up. But there is one pattern I see a critical mass of engineering orgs falling into right now, even orgs that are generally quite solid. That is when there is\u00a0<strong>no shared alignment</strong>\u00a0or even shared\u00a0<em>vocabulary</em>\u00a0between engineering and other stakeholders directors, VPs and SVPs, CTO, CIO, principal and distinguished engineers \u2014 on some pretty clutch questions. Such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cWhat is observability?\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cWho needs it?\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cWhat problem are we trying to solve?\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And my favorite: \u201cIs observability still relevant in a post-AI era? Can\u2019t agents do that stuff now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Even some generally excellent CTOs[1]\u00a0have been heard saying things like, \u201cyeah, observability is definitely very important, but all our top priorities are related to AI right now.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset can-restack\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"322\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/substackcdn.com/image/fetch/%24s_%21XKMm%21%2Cw_1456%2Cc_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cq_auto%3Agood%2Cfl_progressive%3Asteep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1918c101-46be-42ed-9a04-0179dcde8e6f_328x322.png?resize=328%2C322&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"328\" />\n<div class=\"image-link-expand\">\n<div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Which gets causality\u00a0<em>exactly backwards</em>. Because your ability to get any returns on your investments into AI will be limited by how swiftly you can validate your changes and learn from them. Another word for this is \u201cOBSERVABILITY\u201d.</p>\n<p>Enough ranting. Want a peek? I\u2019ll share the new table of contents, and a sentence or two about a couple of my own favorite chapters.</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-anchor-post\">Part 6: \u201cObservability Governance\u201d (v2)</h2>\n<p>The new outline is organized to speak to technical decision-makers, starting at the top and loosely descending. What do CTOs need to know? What do VPs and distinguished engineers need to know? and so on. We start off abstract, and become more concrete.</p>\n<p>Since every technical term (e.g. high cardinality, high dimensionality, etc) has become overloaded and undifferentiated by too much sales and marketing, we mostly avoid it. Instead, we use the language of systems and feedback loops.</p>\n<p>Again, we are trying to help your most senior engineers and execs develop a shared understanding of \u201cWhat problem are we solving?\u201d and \u201cWhat is our goal? Technical terms can actually detract and distract from that shared understanding.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>An Open Letter to CTOs:</strong>\u00a0<strong>Why Organizational Learning Speed is Now Your Biggest Constraint</strong>. Organizations used to be limited by the speed of delivery; now they are limited by how swiftly they can validate and understand what they delivered.</li>\n<li><strong>Systems Thinking for Software Delivery</strong>. Observability is the signal that connects the dots to make a feedback loop; no observability<em>,</em>\u00a0<em>no loop</em>. What happens to amplifying or balancing loops when that signal is lossy, laggy, or missing?</li>\n<li><strong>The Observability Landscape Through a Systems Lens</strong>. What feedback loops do developers need, and what feedback loops does ops need? How do these map to the tools on the market?</li>\n<li><strong>The Business Case for Observability</strong>. Is your observability a cost center or an investment? How should you quantify your RoI?</li>\n<li><strong>Diagnosing Your Observability Investment</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The Organizational Shift</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Build vs Buy (vs Open Source)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The Art and Science of Vendor Partnerships.</strong>\u00a0Internal transformations run on trust and credibility; vendor partnerships run on trust and reciprocity. We\u2019ll talk about both of these, as well as how to run a strong POC.</li>\n<li><strong>Instrumentation for Observability Teams</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Where to Go From Here</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hey, I have\u00a0<em>a lot</em>\u00a0of empathy right now for leaders and execs who feel like they\u2019re behind on everything. I feel it too. Anyone who doesn\u2019t is lying to themselves (or their name is\u00a0<a href=\"http://x.com/simonw\" rel=\"\">Simon Willison</a>).</p>\n<p>But the role observability plays in complex sociotechnical systems is one of those foundational concepts\u00a0<strong>you need to understand</strong>. You\u2019re not gonna get this right by accident. You\u2019re not going to win by doing the same thing you were doing five years ago. And if you screw up your observability, you screw up everything downstream of it too.</p>\n<p>To those of you who do understand this, and are working hard to drive change in your organizations: I see you. It is hard, often thankless work, but it is\u00a0<strong>work worth doing</strong>. If I can ever be of help: reach out.</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-anchor-post\">A longer book, but a better book</h2>\n<p>The last few chapters are heading into tech review on Friday, February 20th.\u00a0<em>Finally</em>. The last 3.5 months have been some of the most panicky and stressful of my life.

                "<p>The problem: people hate crime and think it&#8217;s going up. But actually, crime <a href=\"https://blog.outlandish.claims/p/higher-crime-areas-are-safer\">barely affects most people</a> and is <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/record-low-crime-rates-are-real-not\">historically low</a>. So what&#8217;s going on? </p><p>In our discussion yesterday, many commenters proposed that the discussion about &#8220;crime&#8221; was really about disorder.</p><p>Disorder takes many forms, but its symptoms include litter, graffiti, shoplifting, tent cities, weird homeless people wandering about muttering to themselves, and people walking around with giant boom boxes shamelessly playing music at 200 decibels on a main street where people are trying to engage in normal activities. When people complain about these things, they risk getting called a racist or a &#8220;Karen&#8221;. But when they complain about <em>crime</em>, there&#8217;s still a 50-50 chance that listeners will let them finish the sentence without accusing them of racism. Might everyone be doing this? And might this explain why people act like crime is rampant and increasing, even when it&#8217;s rare and going down?</p><p>This seems plausible. But it depends on a claim that disorder is increasing, which is surprisingly hard to prove. Going through the symptoms in order:</p><p><strong>Litter: </strong>Roadside litter (eg on highways) decreased 80% since records began in 1969 (<a href=\"https://kab.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Litter-Study-Summary-Report-May-2021_final_05172021.pdf\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bottlebill.org/images/PDF/Keep%20America%20Beautiful%202020%20National%20Litter%20Study%20report%20March%202021(1).pdf\">2</a>), but it&#8217;s unclear if this extends to urban environments. New York City has a litter inspection and rating system that&#8217;s been in place since 1973, and they also report improvement - &#8220;from roughly 70 percent acceptably clean in the 1970s to over 90 percent clean now&#8221; - although <a href=\"https://www.gothamgazette.com/government/5611-bushwick-students-give-citys-street-cleanliness-scorecards-an-incomplete/\">citizens protest</a> that the system doesn&#8217;t match their experience. National surveys find that the percent of people who admit to littering <a href=\"https://www.hampton.gov/DocumentCenter/View/306/litter-factsheet-behavior?bidId=\">has gone down</a> from 50% in 1969 to 15% today. None of these are knockdown evidence on their own, but taken together and added to the overall crime trends, the evidence for a secular trend downwards is convincing. The more recent numbers are all confounded by the pandemic, and I have no confidence in the direction of the trend since 2010.</p><p><strong>Graffiti: </strong>There are no good data for graffiti. Most of the discussion focuses on New York, where everyone agrees the long-term trend is down since 1970. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti_in_New_York_City\">Graffiti In New York City</a> Wikipedia page has a &#8220;decline of New York graffiti subculture&#8221; section, which explains that in the 1980s, when &#8220;broken window&#8221; policing became popular, the police cracked down on graffiti and this worked somewhat. The only numbers are <a href=\"https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/cgi-park2/2016/09/which-sections-of-the-city-generate-the-most-least-complaints-to-graffiti-free-nyc/\">here</a>, and they describe a decrease of 13% in calls to the graffiti hotline between 2011 and 2016. But the more recent picture, and the story in other cities, is less sanguine; in the past few years, graffiti <a href=\"https://beverlypress.com/2024/05/uptick-in-graffiti-paints-a-bleak-picture/\">is </a>&#8220;a bigger problem than ever&#8221; in Los Angeles and has &#8220;gotten worse&#8221; <a href=\"https://abc7news.com/post/graffiti-in-san-francisco-tagging-vandalism-street/13801629/\">in</a> San Francisco. Plausibly this is the same pattern as crime, which was declining for decades until COVID and the Black Lives Matter protests caused it to rebound in 2020. A contrary data point is Britain, where graffiti reports almost doubled between 2013 - 2017; I don&#8217;t know enough about the British context to have an opinion.</p><p><strong>Shoplifting: </strong>According to FBI crime statistics, shoplifting remains well below historic highs, although still somewhat higher than the local minimum in 2005 (<a href=\"https://archive.is/oTuGz\">source</a>):</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HjbJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb41245a0-a3db-4953-92b0-f1f9cb13b89d_1244x878.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"434.7652733118971\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HjbJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb41245a0-a3db-4953-92b0-f1f9cb13b89d_1244x878.png\" width=\"616\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Even if we worry about the increase over the 2005 low, it seems to be only about 33%, over fifteen years, which should be hard to notice.

The NRS is sponsored by a retail trade industry group which really wants to find shoplifting so they can lobby for better anti-shoplifting measures. In 2024 they were so embarrassed by their failure to do so that they <a href=\"https://counciloncj.org/shoplifting-trends-what-you-need-to-know/\">stopped the survey entirely and sold the survey brand to an anti-shoplifting security tech company</a> (no bias there!). The company replaced it with a survey of vibes among store owners, and dutifully reported that the vibes about shoplifting had never been worse and you needed to buy their product right away.</p><p>Now what? The survey doesn&#8217;t disaggregate by city, so maybe national shoplifting is stable, but San Francisco really is worse, and just isn&#8217;t reporting it to the police? </p><p>Might this be because there are fewer stores (everyone is buying through Amazon) and therefore even if all existing stores are crammed with shoplifters all the time, it shows up as less shoplifting? This isn&#8217;t trivially true - the number of stores has declined less than I would expect, maybe not at all - but there&#8217;s been a shift in types of stores (from big box to local). If these types have different shoplifting or reporting patterns, that might matter.</p><p>Otherwise, we&#8217;re in the awkward position where everyone (including stores) reports higher shoplifting numbers, but two datasets both disagree.</p><p><strong>Homelessness and Tent Encampments: </strong>Here&#8217;s a graph of homelessness, courtesy of Claude:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t2K8!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05ae2100-6afc-44b2-b334-15132ac3cb29_906x887.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"618.7461368653421\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t2K8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05ae2100-6afc-44b2-b334-15132ac3cb29_906x887.png\" width=\"632\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">I&#8217;ve confirmed the post 2009 trend; I haven&#8217;t fully double-checked the others but they match my impressions.</figcaption></figure></div><p>This looks like a similar pattern to crime, although here the likely explanation for the COVID bump is <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/i/179630044/the-housing-theory-of-everything\">the pandemic-associated rise in house prices</a>. </p><p>Good measures of tent encampments over long periods are hard to find.

It does rule out a story where encampments are increasing <em>because</em> the police are no longer taking action - aside from the pandemic, police are taking more action than ever, at least as measured here.</p><p><strong>People With Loud Boom Boxes In Public Places: </strong>All I have to say about this one is that it&#8217;s terrible and I hate it.</p><p>Overall, it&#8217;s surprisingly hard to find data confirming that disorder has increased:</p><ul><li><p>Littering seems to be down</p></li><li><p>Graffiti is unclear, probably varies by city.</p></li><li><p>Shoplifting seems to be up 20% from generational lows, but still lower than 1990s.</p></li><li><p>Homelessness seems to be up 25% from generational lows, and equal to the 1990s.</p></li><li><p>Tent encampments are hard to measure nationally; in SF, they are below pre-pandemic levels.</p></li></ul><p>All of this is compatible with a story where disorder levels mostly track crime levels: rising from 1970 - 1990, declining from 1990 - 2020, and rising a little after 2020. Crime began falling again around 2023, but the evidence on disorder, while too spotty to say for sure, doesn&#8217;t seem to include such a reversal.</p><p>So here are three theories of perceived rise in disorder:</p><p><strong>Theory one:</strong> these concerns stem from the small (compared to secular trends) bump in these problems around 2020. Since then, crime and tent cities have declined, but people still haven&#8217;t updated because of a combination of lag time and maybe some other forms of disorder still increasing.</p><p>This feels wrong to me: people aren&#8217;t comparing the present to the golden age of 2019, they&#8217;re comparing it to the golden age of their parents and grandparents&#8217; generation. So let&#8217;s take a longer view.</p><p><strong>Theory two: </strong>Modern disorder was effectively impossible before 1950. There was little litter: cheap packaging and disposable bottles had not yet entered into common use. There was no graffiti: spray paint had not yet been invented. There were no boom boxes: they hadn&#8217;t been invented either. There were no cheap polyester tents. There was no pot smoke; although marijuana was known to science, it hadn&#8217;t yet entered common use.</p><p>Then there was a surge in all these bad things, starting with litter in the 1950s and continuing to cheap boom boxes around 1990. But this happened at the same time as the 1960s race riots, and white people fled to the suburbs and didn&#8217;t encounter the urban environments where these problems were worst. Around 2000, when the direction of white flight reversed and became gentrification, white people moved back to the cities, experienced the urban environment for the first time, and awareness of these problems rose.</p><p>This still doesn&#8217;t quite cash out to a secular rise in squalor and disorder. Murder rates in 1900 were still higher than today. And although there was no plastic waste, the streets of turn-of-the-20th-century cities <a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/article/cities-paved-dung-urban-design-great-horse-manure-crisis-1894/\">were</a> &#8220;literally carpeted with horse feces and dead horses&#8221;, providing &#8220;a breeding ground for billions of flies&#8221;. Let&#8217;s sharpen our focus.</p><p><strong>Theory three: </strong>The 1930s - 1960s were a local minimum in crime and disorder of all types. The horses had been sent to pasture, but plastic litter had yet to take off. The tenements were being replaced by suburbs, but graffiti had not yet been invented. Crime rates were only half as high as the periods immediately before or after:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vJFp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5f38dc6-ddb3-45ec-ae02-dde2ae2f67c1_923x750.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"492.4160346695558\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vJFp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5f38dc6-ddb3-45ec-ae02-dde2ae2f67c1_923x750.png\" width=\"606\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><a href=\"https://counciloncj.org/crime-trends-in-u-s-cities-year-end-2025-update/\">Source</a>. Data on property crimes is worse, but suggestive of the same pattern.</figcaption></figure></div><p>What caused this local minimum in crime? Claude suggests a combination of low Depression-era birth rates (small cohort of adolescents in peak crime years), the wartime economy and postwar economic boom, high psychiatric institutionalization rates, and &#8220;cultural and social cohesion&#8221; in the wake of WWII - but none of these explain why the trend should start in 1933, nor reach then-record lows by 1939.</p><p>Nor does it explain why we should update so strongly on this unique period that we still feel cheated sixty years later when things aren&#8217;t quite as good. Maybe this is just the way of things; the Romans were constantly complaining about their failure to equal golden ages centuries in the past. Still, I find it helpful to remember that although things are worse than the best they&#8217;ve ever been (except murder! murder might actually be beating 1950s record lows!), they&#8217;re not so bad by the standard of average historical periods.</p><p>Finally, <strong>theory four</strong>: the squalor and disorder of the past took different forms than the squalor and disorder of the present. Horse feces and flies instead of litter and graffiti. People crowded ten to a tenement apartment instead of sharing the subway with a boom box guy. Tobacco smoke everywhere (including restaurants and fancy hotels) instead of marijuana smoke everywhere. Crime that looked like picaresque stabbings at bordellos, or gunfights at saloons, by characters with names like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_W._Piper\">Thomas Piper, the Belfry Butcher</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Jane_Robinson\">Sarah Jane Robinson, The Poison Fiend</a>, rather than [insert various descriptions that would get me cancelled for racism]. We look for our current problems in the past and cannot find them, then romanticize the problems the past really had.</p><p>Many people complained that by talking about crime yesterday, I was distracting from the rise in disorder. Probably people will complain today that by talking about littering and graffiti and so on, I&#8217;m distracting from some other kind of disorder which is definitely increasing - maybe open-air drug markets, or tent cities, or the boom boxes. That&#8217;s fine. But as I said when arguing with you in the comments, I think the following two statements are importantly different:</p><ol><li><p>Littering, graffiti, and most violent and property crimes are down, but tent encampments and boom box playing are up. Shoplifting is stable nationally, but that could hide local variation. As some areas gentrify and others worsen, there are shifts in who experiences these problems, and the well-off highly-literate white people who set the national conversation are getting more exposed to them.</p></li><li><p>Crime and disorder are rampant, nobody feels safe anymore, cities are falling apart and the police don&#8217;t care, the West has fallen.</p></li></ol><p>My goal isn&#8217;t to deny anyone&#8217;s lived experience, nor to discount the importance of solving these problems (I support the death penalty for boom box carriers). It&#8217;s to push back against a sort of <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/book-review-the-revolt-of-the-public\">Revolt Of The Public</a>-esque sense that everything is worse than it&#8217;s ever been before and society is collapsing and maybe we should take the authoritarian bargain to stop it. On an emotional level, I feel this too - I can&#8217;t go downtown without feeling it (<a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/half-an-hour-before-dawn-in-san-francisco\">one of many reasons</a> I rarely go to SF). But I don&#8217;t <em>like</em> feeling omnipresent despair at the impending collapse of everything. Having specific thoughts like &#8220;house prices are up since the pandemic, so it&#8217;s no surprise that there are more homeless people, and more of the usual bad things downstream of homeless people&#8221;, rather than vague ones like &#8220;R.I.P. civilization, 4000 BC - 2026 AD&#8221; isn&#8217;t just more grounded in the evidence. It&#8217;s also more compatible with living a normal life. I&#8217;m <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/less-utilitarian-than-thou\">not a pragmatist</a> who thinks you should be allowed to lie or do a biased survey of the evidence in order to live a normal life and escape despair. But I&#8217;m also not some kind of weird anti-pragmatist who makes a virtue out of ignoring evidence in order to keep despairing. </p><p>Here, as with the <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/vibecession-much-more-than-you-wanted\">Vibecession</a>, I will try to keep one foot in the statistical story, one foot in the vibes, and hold myself lightly enough not to miss whatever evidence comes next.</p>"

So what&#8217;s going on? </p><p>In our discussion yesterday, many commenters proposed that the discussion about &#8220;crime&#8221; was really about disorder.</p><p>Disorder takes many forms, but its symptoms include litter, graffiti, shoplifting, tent cities, weird homeless people wandering about muttering to themselves, and people walking around with giant boom boxes shamelessly playing music at 200 decibels on a main street where people are trying to engage in normal activities. When people complain about these things, they risk getting called a racist or a &#8220;Karen&#8221;. But when they complain about <em>crime</em>, there&#8217;s still a 50-50 chance that listeners will let them finish the sentence without accusing them of racism. Might everyone be doing this? And might this explain why people act like crime is rampant and increasing, even when it&#8217;s rare and going down?</p><p>This seems plausible. But it depends on a claim that disorder is increasing, which is surprisingly hard to prove. Going through the symptoms in order:</p><p><strong>Litter: </strong>Roadside litter (eg on highways) decreased 80% since records began in 1969 (<a href=\"https://kab.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Litter-Study-Summary-Report-May-2021_final_05172021.pdf\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bottlebill.org/images/PDF/Keep%20America%20Beautiful%202020%20National%20Litter%20Study%20report%20March%202021(1).pdf\">2</a>), but it&#8217;s unclear if this extends",

Coverage of Claude Code and Cowork, OpenAI\u2019s Codex and other things AI agents continues to be a distinct series, which I\u2019ll continue when I have an open slot.</p>\n<div>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-25111\"></span>\n\n\n</div>\n<p>Most important was the unfortunate dispute between the Pentagon and Anthropic. The Pentagon\u2019s official position is they want sign-off from Anthropic and other AI companies on \u2018all legal uses\u2019 of AI, but without any ability to ask questions or know what those uses are, so effectively any uses at all by all of government. Anthropic is willing to compromise and is okay with military use including kinetic weapons, but wants to say no to fully autonomous weapons and domestic surveillance.</p>\n<p>I believe that a lot of this is a misunderstanding, especially those at the Pentagon not understanding how LLMs work and equating them to more advanced spreadsheets. Or at least I definitely want to believe that, since the alternatives seem way worse.</p>\n<p>The reason the situation is dangerous is that the Pentagon is threatening not only to cancel Anthropic\u2019s contract, which would be no big deal, but to label them as a \u2018supply chain risk\u2019 on the level of Huawei, which would be an expensive logistical nightmare that would substantially damage American military power and readiness.</p>\n<p>This week I also covered two podcasts from Dwarkesh Patel, the first with Dario Amodei and the second with Elon Musk.</p>\n<p>Even for me, this pace is unsustainable, and I will once again be raising my bar.

I think that \u2018stochastic parrots/spicy autocomplete\u2019 is, similarly, highbrow misinformation.</p>\n<p>It takes a nugget of a technical truth: base models are trained to be next token predictors, and while they\u2019re later trained on a much more complex objective they\u2019re still at inference doing prediction. But it is deployed mostly to confuse people and leave them less informed.</p>\n<p>I constantly see people saying \u2018well it\u2019s just autocomplete\u2019 to try to explain LLM behavior that cannot usefully be explained that way. No one using it makes any effort to distinguish between the objective in training &#8211; which is NOT pure prediction during RLHF &#8211; and inference.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The most prominent complaint is constant hallucinations. <a href=\"https://x.com/AndrewCritchPhD/status/2022184236720304280\">That used to be a big deal</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/GaryMarcus/status/2022042329033724168/history\">Gary Marcus</a>: How did this work out?

Maybe in 2-3 months.</p>\n<p>What you don\u2019t want is the slow drip of people getting laid off, never finding work again while 60-70 percent of people are still employed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/genesalvatore/status/2022080739047555290\">Gene Salvatore</a>: The \u2018Slow Drip\u2019 is the worst-case scenario because it creates a permanent, invisible underclass while the majority looks away.</p>\n<p>The current SaaS model is designed to maximize that drip\u2014extracting efficiency from the bottom without breaking the top. To stop it, we have to invert the flow of capital at the architectural level.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I know people care deeply about inequality in various ways, but it still blows my mind to see people treating 35% unemployment as a worst-case scenario. It\u2019s very obviously better than 50% and worse than 20%, and the worst case scenario is 100%?</p>\n<p>If we get permanent 35% unemployment due to AI automation, but it stopped there, that\u2019s going to require redistribution and massive adjustments, but I would have every confidence that this would happen. We would have more than enough wealth to handle this, indeed if we care we already do and we are in this scenario seeing massive economic growth.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">They Kept Our Agents</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/davidmanheim/status/2024404582323913148\">Seth Lazar asks, what happens</a> if your work says they have a right to all your work product, and that includes all your AI agents, agent skills and relevant documentation and context? Could this tie workers hands and prevent them from leaving?</p>\n<p>My answer is mostly no, because you end up wanting to redo all that relatively frequently anyway, and duplication or reimplementation would not be so difficult and has its benefits, even if they do manage to hold you to it.</p>\n<p>To the extent this is not true, I do not expect employers to be able to \u2018get away with\u2019 tying their workers hands in this way in practice, both because of practical difficulties of locking these things down and also that employees you want won\u2019t stand for it when it matters.

Their example is that the legal status of using AI to respond to debt collection lawsuits to help you fill out checkboxes is unclear. We don\u2019t know exactly where the lines are, but it seems very clear that you can use AI to greatly improve ability to respond here and this is de facto legal. This paper claims AI services will be inhibited, and perhaps they somewhat are, but Claude and ChatGPT and Gemini exist and are already doing it.</li>\n<li>Most legal situations are not adversarial, although many are, and there are massive gains already being seen in automating such work. In fully adversarial situations increased productivity can cancel out, but one should expect decreasing marginal returns to ensure there are still gains, and discovery seems like an excellent example of where AI should decrease costs. The counterexample of discovery is because it opened up vastly more additional human work, and we shouldn\u2019t expect that to apply here.\n<ol>\n<li>AI also allows for vastly superior predictability of outcomes, which should lead to more settlements and ways to avoid lawsuits in the first place, so it\u2019s not obvious that AI results in more lawsuits.</li>\n<li>The place I do worry about this a lot is where previously productivity was insufficiently high for legal action at all, or for threats of legal action to be credible. We might open up quite a lot of new action there.</li>\n<li>There is a big <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/levels-of-friction\">Levels of Friction</a> consideration here. Our legal system is designed around legal actions being expensive. It may quickly break if legal actions become cheap.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The human bottlenecks like judges could limit but not prevent gains, and can themselves use AI to improve their own productivity. The obvious solution is to outsource many judge tasks to AIs at least by default. You can give parties option to appeal at the risk of pissing off the human judge if you do it for no reason, they report that in Brazil AI is already accelerating judge work.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can add:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>They point out that legal services are expensive in large part because they are \u2018credence goods,\u2019 whose quality is difficult to evaluate. However AI will make it much easier to evaluate quality of legal work.</li>\n<li>They point out a 2017 Clio study that lawyers only engaged in billable work for 2.3 hours a day and billed for 1.9 hours, because the rest was spent finding clients, managing administrative tasks and collecting payments. AI can clearly greatly automate much of the remaining ~6 hours, enabling lawyers to do and bill for several times more billable legal work. The reason for this is that the law doesn\u2019t allow humans to service the other roles, but there\u2019s no reason AI couldn\u2019t service those roles. So if anything this means AI is unusually helpful here.</li>\n<li>If you increase the supply of law hours, basic economics says price drops.</li>\n<li>It sounds like our current legal system is deeply f***ed in lots of ways, perhaps AI can help us write better laws to fix that, or help people realize why that isn\u2019t happening and stop letting lawyers win so many elections. A man can dream.</li>\n<li>If an AI can \u2018draft 50 perfect provisions\u2019 in a contract, then another AI can confirm that the provisions are perfect, and provide a proper summary of implications and check the provisions against your preferences. As they note, mostly humans currently agree to contracts without even reading them, so \u2018forgoing human oversight\u2019 would frequently not mean anything was lost.</li>\n<li>A lot of this \u2018time for lawyers to understand complex contracts\u2019 talk sounds like the people who said that humans would need to go over and fully understand every line of AI code so there would not be productivity gains there.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t improve matters a lot via reform.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>On unlicensed practice of law, a good law would be a big win, but a bad law could be vastly worse than no law, and I do not trust lawyers to have our best interests at heart when drafting this rule. So actually it might be better to do nothing, since it is currently (to my surprise) working out fine.</li>\n<li>Adjudication reform could be great. AI could be an excellent neutral expert and arbitrate many questions. Human fallbacks can be left in place.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>They do a strong job of raising considerations in different directions, much better than the overall framing would suggest. The general claim is essentially \u2018productivity gains get forbidden or eaten\u2019 akin to the Sumo Burja \u2018you cannot automate fake jobs\u2019 thesis.</p>\n<p>Whereas I think that much of the lawyers\u2019 jobs are real, and also you can do a lot of automation of even the fake parts, especially in places where the existing system turns out not to do lawyers any favors. The place I worry, and why I think the core thesis is correct that total legal costs may rise, is getting the law involved in places where it previously would have avoided.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/deanwball/status/2023204167146222059\">In general, I think it is correct</a> to think that you will find bottlenecks and ways for some of the humans to remain productive for even rather high mundane AI capability levels, but that this does not engage with what happens when AI gets sufficiently advanced beyond that.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/tszzl/status/2023170462059217199\">roon</a>: but i figure the existence of employment will last far longer than seems intuitive based on the cataclysmic changes in economic potentials we are seeing</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/deanwball/status/2023204167146222059\">Dean W.

Owners of the businesses are often prideful, mistrustful, confused, embarrassed or angry. So the key bottleneck is not the financial analysis but the relationship management. I think John Pressman pushes back too strongly against this, but he\u2019s right to point out that AI outperforms existing doctors on bedside manner without us having trained for that in particular. I don\u2019t see this kid of social mastery and emotional management as being that hard to ultimately automate.

He says Rakoff was focused on the wrong questions and parallels, and expects this to get overruled, and that using AI for the purposes of preparing communication with your attorney will ultimately be protected.</p>\n<p>My view and the LLM consensus is that Rakoff\u2019s ruling likely gets upheld unless we change the law, but that one cannot be certain. Note that there are ways to offer services where a search can\u2019t get at the relevant information, if those involved are wise enough to think about that question in advance.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/mpeltz/status/2023876203397214518\">Moish Peltz</a>: Judge Rakoff just issued a written order affirming his bench decision, that [no you don\u2019t have any protections for your AI conversations.]</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/jimrandomh/status/2023963663716237357/history\">Jim Babcock</a>: Having read the text of this ruling, I believe it is clearly in error, and it is unlikely to be repeated in other courts.<br />\nThe underlying facts of this case are that a criminal defendant used an AI chatbot (Claude) to prepare documents about defense strategy, which he then sent to his counsel. Those interactions were seized in a search of the defendant&#8217;s computers (not from a subpoena of Anthropic). The argument is then about whether those documents are subject to attorney-client privilege. The ruling holds that they are not.<br />\nThe defense argues that, in this context, using Claude this way was analogous to using an internet-based word processor to prepare a letter to his attorney.<br />\nThe ruling not only fails to distinguish the case with Claude from the case with a word processor, it appears to hold that, if a search were to find a draft of a letter from a client to his attorney written on paper in the traditional way, then that letter would also not be privileged.<br />\nThe ruling cites a non-binding case, Shih v Petal Card, which held that communications from a civil plaintiff to her lawyer could be withheld in discovery&#8230; and disagrees with its holding (not just with its applicability). So we already have a split, even if the split is not exactly on-point, which makes it much more likely to be reviewed by higher courts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/allTheYud/status/2024295214182257016\">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a>: This is very sensible but consider: The *funniest* way to solve this problem would be to find a jurisdiction, perhaps outside the USA, which will let Claude take the bar exam and legally recognize it as a lawyer.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Predictions Are Hard, Especially About The Future, But Not Impossible</h4>\n\n\n<p>Freddie DeBoer takes the maximally anti-prediction position, so one can only go by events that have already happened. One cannot even logically anticipate the consequences of what AI can already do when it is diffused further into the economy, and one definitely cannot anticipate future capabilities. Not allowed, he says.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/im-offering-scott-alexander-a-wager\">Freddie deBoer</a>: I have said it before, and I will say it again: I will take extreme claims about the consequences of \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d seriously when you can show them to me now. I will not take claims about the consequences of AI seriously as long as they take the form of you telling me what you believe will happen in the future. I will seriously entertain evidence-backed observations, not speculative predictions.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the rule; that\u2019s the law. That\u2019s the ethic, the discipline, the mantra, the creed, the holy book, the catechism. Show me what AI is currently doing. Show me! I\u2019m putting down my marker here because I\u2019d like to get out of the AI discourse business for at least a year &#8211; it\u2019s thankless and pointless &#8211; so let me please leave you with that as a suggestion for how to approach AI stories moving forward. Show, don\u2019t tell, prove, don\u2019t predict.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Freddie rants repeatedly that everyone predicting AI will cause things to change has gone crazy. I do give him credit for noticing that even sensible \u2018skeptical\u2019 takes are now predicting that the world will change quite a lot, if you look under the hood. The difference is he then uses that to call those skeptics crazy.</p>\n<p>Normally I would not mention someone doing this unless they were far more prominent than Freddie, but what makes this different is <a href=\"https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/i/187862732/bet-conditions-predicting-a-normal-economy\">he virtuously offers a wager</a>, and makes it so he has to win ALL of his claims in order to win three years later.

There\u2019s tons of room for AI to be impacting the world quite a bit, without Freddie being in serious danger of losing one of these. The unemployment rate has to jump to 18% in three years?

Or maybe you think we are simply incapable of that.</p>\n<p>As this happens, it can be useful to distinguish \u201ccriticisms of AI\u201d from \u201cpeople who cannot imagine that world rebuilding will go well.\u201d A lot of what parades as the former is actually the latter.</p>\n<p>Jacob: Who is this \u201cwe\u201d? When the strong AI rebuilds their world, what makes you think you\u2019ll be involved?</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think Tyler\u2019s narrow point is valid if we assume AI stays mundane, and that the modern world is suffering from a lot of seeing so many things as sacred entitlements or Too Big To Fail, and being unwilling to rebuild or replace, and the price of that continues to rise. Historically it usually takes a war to force people\u2019s hand, and we\u2019d like to avoid going there. We keep kicking various cans down the road.</p>\n<p>A lot of the reason that we have been unable to rebuild is that we have become extremely risk averse, loss averse and entitled, and unwilling to sacrifice or endure short term pain, and we have made an increasing number of things effectively sacred values. A lot of AI talk is people noticing that AI will break one or another sacred thing, or pit two sacred things against each other, and not being able to say out loud that maybe not all these things can or need to be sacred.</p>\n<p>Even mundane AI does two different things here.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It will invalidate increasingly many of the ways the current world works, forcing us to reorient and rebuild so we have a new set of systems that works.</li>\n<li>It provides the productivity growth and additional wealth that we need to potentially avoid having to reorient and rebuild. If AI fails to provide a major boost and the system is not rebuilt, the system is probably going to collapse under its own weight within our lifetimes, forcing our hand.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If AI does not stay mundane, the world utterly transforms, and to the extent we stick around and stay in charge, or want to do those things, yes we will need to \u2018rebuild,\u2019 but that is not the primary problem we would face.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=6251400\">Cass Sunstein claims in a new paper</a> that you could in theory create a \u2018[classical] liberal AI\u2019 that functioned as a \u2018choice engine\u2019 that preserved autonomy, respected dignity and helped people overcome bias and lack of information and personalization, thus making life more free. It is easy to imagine, again in theory, such an AI system, and easy to see that a good version of this would be highly human welfare-enhancing.</p>\n<p>Alas, Cass is only thinking on the margin and addressing one particular deployment of mundane AI. I agree this would be an excellent deployment, we should totally help give people choice engines, but it does not solve any of the larger problems even if implemented well, and people will rapidly end up \u2018out of the loop\u2019 even if we do not see so much additional frontier AI progress (for whatever reason). This alone cannot, as it were, rebuild the world, nor can it solve problems like those causing the clash between the Pentagon and Anthropic.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Augmented Reality</h4>\n\n\n<p>Augmented reality is coming.
