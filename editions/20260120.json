I am at the tail\nend of AI adoption, so I don\u2019t expect to say anything particularly useful or novel. However, I am\nconstantly complaining about the lack of boring AI posts, so it\u2019s only proper if I write one.</p>\n<section id=\"Problem-Statement\">\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://matklad.github.io/2026/01/20/vibecoding-2.html#Problem-Statement\">Problem Statement</a></h2>\n<p>At TigerBeetle, we are big on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#simulation-testing\">deterministic simulation testing</a>.\nWe even use it\n<a href=\"https://tigerbeetle.com/blog/2025-11-28-tale-of-four-fuzzers/#fuzzer-5-can-i-count-no\">to track performance</a>,\nto some degree. Still, it is crucial to verify performance numbers on a real cluster in its natural\nhigh-altitude habitat.</p>\n<p>To do that, you need to procure six machines in a cloud, get your custom version of <code>tigerbeetle</code>\nbinary on them, connect cluster\u2019s replicas together and hit them with load. It feels like, quarter\nof a century into the third millennium, \u201crun stuff on six machines\u201d should be a problem just a notch\nharder than opening a terminal and typing <code>ls</code>, but I personally don\u2019t know how to solve it without\nwasting a day. So, I spent a day vibecoding my own square wheel.</p>\n<p>The <em>general</em> shape of the problem is that I want to spin a fleet of ephemeral machines with given\nspecs on demand and run ad-hoc commands in a SIMD fashion on them. I don\u2019t want to manually type\nslightly different commands into a six-way terminal split, but I also do want to be able to ssh into\na specific box and poke it around.</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"Solution\">\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://matklad.github.io/2026/01/20/vibecoding-2.html#Solution\">Solution</a></h2>\n<p>My idea for the solution comes from these three sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a class=\"url\" href=\"https://github.com/catern/rsyscall\">https://github.com/catern/rsyscall</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a class=\"url\" href=\"https://peter.bourgon.org/blog/2011/04/27/remote-development-from-mac-to-linux.html\">https://peter.bourgon.org/blog/2011/04/27/remote-development-from-mac-to-linux.html</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a class=\"url\" href=\"https://github.com/dsherret/dax\">https://github.com/dsherret/dax</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The big idea of <code>rsyscall</code> is that you can program distributed system in direct style. When\nprogramming locally, you do things by issuing syscalls:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code-block\">\n\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">const</span> fd = open(<span class=\"hl-string\">&quot;/etc/passwd&quot;</span>);</span></code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n<p>This API works for doing things on remote machines, if you specify which machine you want to run the\nsyscall on:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code-block\">\n\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">const</span> fd_local = open(.host, <span class=\"hl-string\">&quot;/etc/passwd&quot;</span>);</span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">const</span> fd_cloud = open(.{.addr = <span class=\"hl-string\">&quot;1.2.3.4&quot;</span>}, <span class=\"hl-string\">&quot;/etc/passwd&quot;</span>);</span></code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n<p>Direct manipulation is the most natural API, and it pays to extend it over the network boundary.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Peter\u2019s post is an application of a similar idea to a narrow, mundane task of developing on Mac and\ntesting on Linux. Peter suggests two scripts:</p>\n<p><code>remote-sync</code> synchronizes a local and remote projects. If you run <code>remote-sync</code> inside <code>~/p/tb</code>\nfolder, then <code>~/p/tb</code> materializes on the remote machine. <code>rsync</code> does the heavy lifting, and the\nwrapper script implements <code>DWIM</code> behaviors.</p>\n<p>It is typically followed by\n<span class=\"display\"><code>remote-run some --command</code>,</span>\nwhich runs command on the remote machine in the matching directory, forwarding output back to you.</p>\n<p>So, when I want to test local changes to <code>tigerbeetle</code> on my Linux box, I have roughly the following\nshell session:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code-block\">\n\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-title function_\">$</span> cd ~/p/tb/work</span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-title function_\">$</span> code . # hack here</span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-title function_\">$</span> remote-sync</span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-title function_\">$</span> remote-run ./zig/zig build test</span></code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n<p>The killer feature is that shell-completion works. I first type the command I want to run, taking\nadvantage of the fact that local and remote commands are the same, paths and all, then hit <code>^A</code> and\nprepend <code>remote-run</code> (in reality, I have <code>rr</code> alias that combines sync&amp;run).</p>\n<p>The big thing here is not the commands per se, but the shift in the mental model. In a traditional\nssh &amp; vim setup, you have to juggle two machines with a separate state, the local one and the remote\none. With <code>remote-sync</code>, the state is the same across the machines, you only choose whether you want\nto run commands here or there.</p>\n<p>With just two machines, the difference feels academic. But if you want to run your tests across\n<em>six</em> machines, the ssh approach fails \u2014 you don\u2019t want to re-vim your changes to source files six\ntimes, you really do want to separate the place where the code is edited from the place(s) where the\ncode is run. This is a general pattern \u2014 if you are not sure about a particular aspect of your\ndesign, try increasing the cardinality of the core abstraction from 1 to 2.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The third component, <code>dax</code> library, is pretty mundane \u2014 just a JavaScript library for shell\nscripting. The notable aspects there are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>JavaScript\u2019s <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals\">template literals</a>,\nwhich allow implementing command interpolation in a safe by construction way.

Haven\u2019t used in anger yet, but this is something I wanted for a long time, and now I\nhave it</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"Structure\">\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://matklad.github.io/2026/01/20/vibecoding-2.html#Structure\">Structure</a></h2>\n<p>The problem with implementing above is that I have zero practical experience with modern cloud. I\nonly created my AWS account today, and just looking at the console interface ignited the urge to\nre-read The Castle. Not my cup of pu-erh. But I had a hypothesis that AI should be good at wrangling\nbaroque cloud API, and it mostly held.</p>\n<p>I started with a couple of paragraphs of rough, super high-level description of what I want to get.\nNot a specification at all, just a general gesture towards unknown unknowns. Then I asked ChatGPT to\nexpand those two paragraphs into a more or less complete spec to hand down to an agent for\nimplementation.</p>\n<p>This phase surfaced a bunch of unknowns for me. For example, I wasn\u2019t thinking at all that I somehow\nneed to identify machines, ChatGPT suggested using random hex numbers, and I realized that I do need\n0,1,2 naming scheme to concisely specify batches of machines. While thinking about this, I realized\nthat sequential numbering scheme also has an advantage that I <em>can\u2019t</em> have two concurrent clusters\nrunning, which is a desirable property for my use-case. If I forgot to shutdown a machine, I\u2019d\nrather get an error on trying to re-create a machine with the same name, then to silently avoid the\nclash. Similarly, turns out the questions of permissions and network access rules are something to\nthink about, as well as what region and what image I need.</p>\n<p>With the spec document in hand, I turned over to Claude code for actual implementation work. The\nfirst step was to further refine the spec, asking Claude if anything is unclear. There were couple\nof interesting clarifications there.</p>\n<p>First, the original ChatGPT spec didn\u2019t get what I meant with my \u201ccurrent directory mapping\u201d idea,\nthat I want to materialize a local <code>~/p/tb/work</code> as remote <code>~/p/tb/work</code>, even if <code>~</code> are different.\nChatGPT generated an incorrect description <em>and</em> an incorrect example. I manually corrected example,\nbut wasn\u2019t able to write a concise and correct description. Claude fixed that working from the\nexample. I feel like I need to internalize this more \u2014 for current crop of AI, examples seem to be\nfar more valuable than rules.</p>\n<p>Second, the spec included my desire to auto-shutdown machines once I no longer use them, just to\nmake sure I don\u2019t forget to turn the lights off when leaving the room. Claude grilled me on what\n<em>precisely</em> I want there, and I asked it to DWIM the thing.</p>\n<p>The spec ended up being 6KiB of English prose. The final implementation was 14KiB of TypeScript. I\nwasn\u2019t keeping the spec and the implementation perfectly in sync, but I think they ended up pretty\nclose in the end. Which means that prose specifications are somewhat more compact than code, but not\n<em>much</em> more compact.</p>\n<p>My next step was to try to just one-shot this. Ok, this is embarrassing, and I usually avoid\nswearing in this blog, but I just typoed that as \u201cone-shit\u201d, and, well, that is one flavorful\ndescription I won\u2019t be able to improve upon. The result was just not good (more on why later), so I\nalmost immediately decided to throw it away and start a more incremental approach.</p>\n<p>In my <a href=\"https://matklad.github.io/2025/08/31/vibe-coding-terminal-editor.html\">previous vibe-post</a>, I\nnoticed that LLM are good at closing the loop. A variation here is that LLMs are good at producing\nresults, and not necessarily good code. I am pretty sure that, if I had let the agent to iterate on\nthe initial script and actually <em>run</em> it against AWS, I would have gotten something working. I\ndidn\u2019t want to go that way for three reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nSpawning VMs takes time, and that significantly reduces the throughput of agentic iteration.\n</li>\n<li>\nNo way I let the agent run with a real AWS account, given that AWS doesn\u2019t have a fool-proof way\nto cap costs.\n</li>\n<li>\nI am fairly confident that this script will be a part of my workflow for at least several years,\nso I care <em>more</em> about long-term code maintenance, than immediate result.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And, as I said, the code didn\u2019t feel good, for these specific reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nIt wasn\u2019t the code that I would have written, it lacked my character, which made it hard for me\nto understand it at a glance.\n</li>\n<li>\nThe code lacked any character whatsoever. It could have worked, it wasn\u2019t \u201cnaively bad\u201d, like the\nfirst code you write when you are learning programming, but there wasn\u2019t anything good there.\n</li>\n<li>\nI never know what the code <em>should</em> be up-front. I don\u2019t design solutions, I discover them in the\nprocess of refactoring. Some of my best work was spending a quiet weekend rewriting large\nsubsystems implemented before me, because, with <em>an</em> implementation at hand, it was possible for\nme to see the actual, beautiful core of what <em>needs</em> to be done. With a slop-dump, I just don\u2019t\nget to even see what could be wrong.\n</li>\n<li>\nIn particular, while you are working the code (as in \u201cwrought iron\u201d), you often go back to\nrequirements and change them. Remember that ambiguity of my request to \u201cshut down idle cluster\u201d?\nClaude tried to DWIM and created some horrific mess of bash scripts, timestamp files, PAM policy\nand systemd units. But the right answer there was \u201clets maybe not have that feature?\u201d (in\ncontrast, simply shutting the machine down after 8 hours is a one-liner).\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The incremental approach worked much better, Claude is good at filling-in the blanks. The very first\nthing I did for <code>box-v2</code> was manually typing-in:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code-block\">\n\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">type</span> <span class=\"hl-variable constant_\">CLI</span> =</span>\n<span class=\"line\">  | <span class=\"hl-title class_\">CLICreate</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\">  | <span class=\"hl-title class_\">CLIDestroy</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\">  | <span class=\"hl-title class_\">CLIList</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\">  | <span class=\"hl-title class_\">CLISync</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">type</span> <span class=\"hl-title class_\">BoxList</span> = <span class=\"hl-built_in\">string</span>[];</span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">type</span> <span class=\"hl-title class_\">CLICreate</span> = { <span class=\"hl-attr\">tag</span>: <span class=\"hl-string\">&quot;create&quot;</span>; <span class=\"hl-attr\">count</span>: <span class=\"hl-built_in\">number</span> };</span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">type</span> <span class=\"hl-title class_\">CLIDestroy</span> = { <span class=\"hl-attr\">tag</span>: <span class=\"hl-string\">&quot;destroy&quot;</span>; <span class=\"hl-attr\">boxes</span>: <span class=\"hl-title class_\">BoxList</span> };</span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">type</span> <span class=\"hl-title class_\">CLIList</span> = { <span class=\"hl-attr\">tag</span>: <span class=\"hl-string\">&quot;list&quot;</span> };</span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">type</span> <span class=\"hl-title class_\">CLISync</span> = { <span class=\"hl-attr\">tag</span>: <span class=\"hl-string\">&quot;sync&quot;</span>; <span class=\"hl-attr\">boxes</span>: <span class=\"hl-title class_\">BoxList</span>; };</span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hl-title function_\">fatal</span>(<span class=\"hl-params\">message: <span class=\"hl-built_in\">string</span></span>): <span class=\"hl-built_in\">never</span> {</span>\n<span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"hl-variable language_\">console</span>.<span class=\"hl-title function_\">error</span>(message);</span>\n<span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"hl-title class_\">Deno</span>.<span class=\"hl-title function_\">exit</span>(<span class=\"hl-number\">1</span>);</span>\n<span class=\"line\">}</span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hl-title function_\">CLIParse</span>(<span class=\"hl-params\">args: <span class=\"hl-built_in\">string</span>[]</span>): <span class=\"hl-variable constant_\">CLI</span> {</span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\">}</span></code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n<p>Then I asked Claude to complete the <code>CLIParse</code> function, and I was happy with the result. Note\n<a class=\"display\" href=\"https://haskellforall.com/2026/01/prompting-101-show-dont-tell\"><em>Show, Don\u2019t Tell</em></a></p>\n<p>I am not <em>asking</em> Claude to avoid throwing an exception and fail fast instead. I just give <code>fatal</code>\nfunction, and it code-completes the rest.</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t say that the code <em>inside</em> <code>CLIParse</code> is top-notch. I\u2019d probably written something more\nspartan. But the important part is that, at this level, I don\u2019t care. The abstraction for parsing\nCLI arguments feel right to me, and the details I can always fix later. This is how this overall\nvibe-coding session transpired \u2014 I was providing structure, Claude was painting by the numbers.</p>\n<p>In particular, with that CLI parsing structure in place, Claude had little problem adding new\nsubcommands and new arguments in a satisfactory way. The only snag was that, when I asked to add an\noptional path to <code>sync</code>, it went with <code>string | null</code>, while I strongly prefer <code>string | undefined</code>.\nObviously, its better to pick your null in JavaScript and stick with it. The fact that <code>undefineed</code>\nis unavoidable predetermines the winner. Given that the argument was added as an incremental small\nchange, course-correcting was trivial.</p>\n<p>The null vs undefined issue perhaps illustrates my complaint about the code lacking character.\n<code>| null</code> is the default non-choice. <code>| undefined</code> is an insight, which I personally learned from VS\nCode LSP implementation.</p>\n<p>The hand-written skeleton/vibe-coded guts worked not only for the CLI. I wrote</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code-block\">\n\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">async</span> <span class=\"hl-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hl-title function_\">main</span>(<span class=\"hl-params\"></span>) {</span>\n<span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"hl-keyword\">const</span> cli = <span class=\"hl-title class_\">CLIParse</span>(<span class=\"hl-title class_\">Deno</span>.<span class=\"hl-property\">args</span>);</span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"hl-keyword\">if</span> (cli.<span class=\"hl-property\">tag</span> === <span class=\"hl-string\">&quot;create&quot;</span>) <span class=\"hl-keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"hl-keyword\">await</span> <span class=\"hl-title function_\">mainCreate</span>(cli.<span class=\"hl-property\">count</span>);</span>\n<span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"hl-keyword\">if</span> (cli.<span class=\"hl-property\">tag</span> === <span class=\"hl-string\">&quot;destroy&quot;</span>) <span class=\"hl-keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"hl-keyword\">await</span> <span class=\"hl-title function_\">mainDestroy</span>(cli.<span class=\"hl-property\">boxes</span>);</span>\n<span class=\"line\">  ...</span>\n<span class=\"line\">}</span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">async</span> <span class=\"hl-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hl-title function_\">mainDestroy</span>(<span class=\"hl-params\">boxes: <span class=\"hl-built_in\">string</span>[]</span>) {</span>\n<span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"hl-keyword\">for</span> (<span class=\"hl-keyword\">const</span> box <span class=\"hl-keyword\">of</span> boxes) {</span>\n<span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"hl-keyword\">await</span> <span class=\"hl-title function_\">instanceDestroy</span>(box);</span>\n<span class=\"line\">  }</span>\n<span class=\"line\">}</span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">async</span> <span class=\"hl-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hl-title function_\">instanceDestroy</span>(<span class=\"hl-params\">id: <span class=\"hl-built_in\">string</span></span>) {</span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\">}</span></code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n<p>and then asked Claude to write the body of a particular function according to the SPEC.md.</p>\n<p>Unlike with the CLI, Claude wasn\u2019t able to follow this pattern itself. With one example it\u2019s not obvious,\nbut the overall structure is that <code>instanceXXX</code> is the AWS-level operation on a single box, and\n<code>mainXXX</code> is the CLI-level control flow that deals with looping and parallelism.

However, given that the nature of the problem is such that I can just run the code and see\nthe result, I am fine with it. If I were writing this myself, trial-and-error would totally be my\napproach as well.</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s synthesis \u2014 with several instance commands implemented, I noticed that many started\nwith querying AWS to resolve symbolic machine name, like \u201c1\u201d, to the AWS name/IP. At that point I\nrealized that resolving symbolic names is a fundamental part of the problem, and that it should only\nhappen once, which resulting in the following refactored shape of the code:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"code-block\">\n\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"hl-keyword\">async</span> <span class=\"hl-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hl-title function_\">main</span>(<span class=\"hl-params\"></span>) {</span>\n<span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"hl-keyword\">const</span> cli = <span class=\"hl-title class_\">CLIParse</span>(<span class=\"hl-title class_\">Deno</span>.<span class=\"hl-property\">args</span>);</span>\n<span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"hl-keyword\">const</span> instances = <span class=\"hl-keyword\">await</span> <span class=\"hl-title function_\">instanceMap</span>();</span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"hl-keyword\">if</span> (cli.<span class=\"hl-property\">tag</span> === <span class=\"hl-string\">&quot;create&quot;</span>) <span class=\"hl-keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"hl-keyword\">await</span> <span class=\"hl-title function_\">mainCreate</span>(instances, cli.<span class=\"hl-property\">count</span>);</span>\n<span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"hl-keyword\">if</span> (cli.<span class=\"hl-property\">tag</span> === <span class=\"hl-string\">&quot;destroy&quot;</span>) <span class=\"hl-keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"hl-keyword\">await</span> <span class=\"hl-title function_\">mainDestroy</span>(instances, cli.<span class=\"hl-property\">boxes</span>);</span>\n<span class=\"line\">  ...</span>\n<span class=\"line\">}</span></code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n<p>Claude was ok with extracting the logic, but messed up the overall code layout, so the final code\nmotions were on me. \u201cContext\u201d arguments go <em>first</em>, not last, common prefix is more valuable than\ncommon suffix because of visual alignment.</p>\n<p>The original \u201cone-shotted\u201d implementation also didn\u2019t do up-front querying. This is an example of a\nshape of a problem I only discover when working with code closely.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Of course, the script didn\u2019t work perfectly the first time and we needed quite a few iterations on\nthe real machines both to fix coding bugs, as well gaps in the spec. That was an interesting\nexperience of speed-running rookie mistakes. Claude made naive bugs, but was also good at fixing\nthem.</p>\n<p>For example, when I first tried to <code>box ssh</code> after <code>box create</code>, I got an error. Pasting it into\nClaude immediately showed the problem. Originally, the code was doing\n<span class=\"display\"><code>aws ec2 wait instance-running</code></span>\nand not\n<span class=\"display\"><code>aws ec2 wait instance-status-ok</code>.</span></p>\n<p>The former checks if instance is logically created, the latter waits until the OS is booted. It\nmakes sense that these two exist, and the difference is clear (and its also clear that OS booted !=\nSSH demon started). Claude\u2019s value here is in providing specific names for the concepts I\nalready know to exist.</p>\n<p>Another fun one was about the disk. I noticed that, while the instance had an SSD, it wasn\u2019t\nactually used. I asked Claude to mount it as home, but that didn\u2019t work. Claude immediately asked me\nto run\n<span class=\"display\"><code>$ box run 0 cat /var/some/unintuitive/long/path.log</code></span>\nand that log immediately showed\nthe problem. This is remarkable! 50% of my typical Linux debugging day is wasted not knowing that a\nuseful log exists, and the other 50% is for searching for the log I know should exist <em>somewhere</em>.</p>\n<p>After the fix, I lost the ability to SSH. Pasting the error immediately gave the answer \u2014 by\nmounting over <code>/home</code>, we were overwriting ssh keys configured prior.</p>\n<p>There were couple of more iterations like that. Rookie mistakes <em>were</em> made, but they were debugged\nand fixed <em>much</em> faster than my personal knowledge allows (and again, I feel that is trivia\nknowledge, rather than deep reusable knowledge, so I am happy to delegate it!).</p>\n<p>It worked satisfactorily in the end, and, what\u2019s more, I am happy to maintain the code, at least to\nthe extent that I personally need it. Kinda hard to measure productivity boost here, but, given just\nthe sheer number of CLI flags required to make this work, I am pretty confident that time was saved,\neven factoring the writing of the present article!</p>\n</section>\n<section id=\"Coda\">\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://matklad.github.io/2026/01/20/vibecoding-2.html#Coda\">Coda</a></h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve recently read <em>The Art of Doing Science and Engineering</em> by Hamming (of distance and code), and\none story stuck with me:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"blockquote\">\n<blockquote><p>A psychologist friend at Bell Telephone Laboratories once built a machine with about 12 switches and\na red and a green light. You set the switches, pushed a button, and either you got a red or a green\nlight. After the first person tried it 20 times they wrote a theory of how to make the green light\ncome on. The theory was given to the next victim and they had their 20 tries and wrote their theory,\nand so on endlessly. The stated purpose of the test was to study how theories evolved.</p>\n<p>But my friend, being the kind of person he was, had connected the lights to a random source! One day\nhe observed to me that no person in all the tests (and they were all high-class Bell Telephone\nLaboratories scientists) ever said there was no message. I promptly observed to him that not one of\nthem was either a statistician or an information theorist, the two classes of people who are\nintimately familiar with randomness. A check revealed I was right!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n</figure>\n</section>"

Yes, there is a calendar, but I don't use it. I use it for the responsive and privacy respecting email service, as well as the essentially unlimited email addresses I can set up on custom domains.</li>\n<li><strong>Apple Notes</strong> \u2014 I've tried the other writing tools, and Apple Notes wins (for me) by being simple, and automatically synced. I use this for writing posts, taking notes, and handling my todo list for the day.</li>\n<li><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> \u2014 I've tried to become a vim or emacs purist, but couldn't commit. I've tried going back to Sublime, but didn't feel like relearning the shortcuts. I've tried all of the new AI-powered IDEs, but found it stripped the joy of coding. VSC works fine and I'll likely use it until humans aren't allowed to code anymore.</li>\n<li><strong>Trello</strong> \u2014 This is where I track all my feature requests, ideas, todos, tasks in progress, and tasks put on hold across my various projects. I'm used to the interface and have never had a problem with it. I'm not a power user, nor do I work as part of a team, so it's just right for my use-case.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bearblog.dev\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Bear Blog</strong></a> \u2014 This goes without saying.

I'm just glad it fits so many other people's use-cases too.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"physical\">Physical</h3><ul>\n<li><strong>Apple Airpods Pro</strong> \u2014 This is the best product Apple makes. I could switch away from the rest of the Apple ecosystem if necessary, but I'd have to keep my Airpods. The noise cancelling and audio fidelity is unlike any other in-ear headphones I've used, and while they'll probably need to be replaced every 5 years, they're well worth the sleep on long-haul flights alone.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Balance_574\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>New Balance 574 shoes</strong></a> \u2014 New Balance created the perfect shoe in the 80s and then never updated them. These shoes are great since they were originally developed as trail running shoes, but have become <em>their own style</em> while being rugged enough to tackle a light trail, or walk around a city all day. They also have a wide toe box to house my flappers.</li>\n<li><strong>CeraVe Moisturising Lotion</strong> \u2014 I didn't realise how healthy my skin could be until Emma forced this on me. My skin has been doing great since switching and I'll likely keep using it until CeraVe discontinues the line.</li>\n<li><strong>Eucerin sensitive protect sunscreen</strong> \u2014 Similarly, all sunscreens I've tried have left my face oily and shiny. This is the first facial sunscreen that I can realistically wear every day without any issues. It's SPF 50+, which is great for someone who loves being outdoors in sunny South Africa.</li>\n<li><strong>Salt of the Earth Crystal deodorant</strong> \u2014 This may sound particularly woo-woo, but I've been using this salt deodorant for the past 8 years and since it doesn't contain any perfume, I smell perfectly neutral all of the time.</li>\n<li><strong>House of Ord felted wool hat</strong> \u2014 I love this hat. It keeps me cool in the sun, but warm when it's cold out. This is due to wool's thermoregulatory properties that evolved to keep the sheep cool in summer and warm in winter. While it's not the most robust hat, I suspect it'll last a few years if I treat it well.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Hat\" src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman/img_1734.webp\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"under-consideration\">Under consideration</h3><p>These are the products I'm using that may make the cut but I haven't used them long enough to be sure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://shop.lululemon.com/p/men-pants/ABC-Pant-Classic-32/_/prod9000003?color=19222\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Lululemon ABC pants</strong></a> \u2014 These are incredibly comfortable stretch pants that pretend (very convincingly) to be a semi-casual set of chinos. The only hesitation I have with them is that they pick up marks and stains incredibly easily.</li>\n<li><strong>Merino wool t-shirts</strong> \u2014 I bought my first merino wool t-shirt recently after rocking cotton for my entire life, and I'm very impressed. These shirts don't get smelly (there are instances of people wearing them for a year straight without issue) and are very soft and comfortable. I'm a bit worried about durability, but if they make packing lighter and are versatile I may slowly start to replace my cotton shirts once they wear out.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I like to be very intentional with my purchases. We live in an 84m^2 apartment and so everything has to have its place to avoid clutter. I understand how possessions can end up owning you, and so I try to keep them as reasonable as possible. A good general rule of thumb is that new things replace worn-out and old things, not add to them. This applies both digitally and physically, since there's only so much mental capacity for digital tools as there is for physical items.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Make things as simple as possible but no simpler.<br />\n\u2014 Albert Einstein</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>This list was last updated 12\u00a0hours, 4\u00a0minutes ago.</em></p>"

                "<p>When I get together with my friends in the industry, I feel a little guilty about how much I love my job. This is a <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/good-times-are-over\">tough time</a> to be a software engineer. The job was less stressful in the late 2010s than it is now, and I sympathize with anyone who is upset about the change. There are a lot of objective reasons to feel bad about work. But despite all that, I\u2019m still having a blast. I enjoy pulling together projects, figuring out difficult bugs, and writing code in general. I like spending time with computers. But what I really love is <strong>being useful</strong>.</p>\n<p>The main character in Gogol\u2019s short story <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/51734e04e4b08db710716119/t/5405e254e4b0f888a353e730/1409671764783/Gogol%2C+The+Overcoat.pdf\"><em>The Overcoat</em></a> is a man called Akaky Akaievich<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/rss.xml#fn-1\">1</a></sup>. Akaky\u2019s job is objectively terrible: he\u2019s stuck in a dead-end copyist role, being paid very little, with colleagues who don\u2019t respect him. Still, he loves his work, to the point that if he has no work to take home with him, he does some recreational copying just for his own sake. Akaky is a dysfunctional person. But his dysfunction makes him a perfect fit for his job<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/rss.xml#fn-2\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard for me to see a problem and not solve it. This is especially true if I\u2019m the only person (or one of a very few people) who could solve it, or if somebody is asking for my help. I feel an almost physical discomfort about it, and a corresponding relief and satisfaction when I do go and solve the problem. The work of a software engineer - or at least my work as a staff software engineer - is perfectly tailored to this tendency. Every day people rely on me to solve a series of technical problems<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/rss.xml#fn-3\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>In other words, like Akaky Akaievich, I don\u2019t mind the ways in which my job is dysfunctional, because it matches the ways in which I myself am dysfunctional: specifically, <strong>my addiction to being useful</strong>. (Of course, it helps that my working conditions are overall <em>much</em> better than Akaky\u2019s). I\u2019m kind of like a working dog, in a way. Working dogs get rewarded with treats<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/rss.xml#fn-4\">4</a></sup>, but they don\u2019t do it <em>for</em> the treats. They do it for the work itself, which is inherently satisfying.</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t true of all software engineers. But it\u2019s certainly true of many I\u2019ve met: if not an addiction to being useful, then they\u2019re driven by an addiction to solving puzzles, or to the complete control over your work product that you only really get in software or mathematics. If they weren\u2019t working as a software engineer, they would be getting really into Factorio, or crosswords, or tyrannically moderating some internet community.</p>\n<p>A lot of the advice I give about working a software engineering job is really about how I\u2019ve shaped my need to be useful in a way that delivers material rewards, and how I try to avoid the pitfalls of such a need. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/predators\"><em>Protecting your time from predators in large tech companies</em></a> is about how some people in tech companies will identify people like me and wring us out in ways that only benefit them. <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/party-tricks\"><em>Crushing JIRA tickets is a party trick, not a path to impact</em></a> is about how I need to be useful <em>to my management chain</em>, not to the ticket queue. <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/impressing-people\"><em>Trying to impress people you don\u2019t respect</em></a> is about how I cope with the fact that I\u2019m compelled to be useful to some people who I may not respect or even like.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a lot of discussion on the internet about what <em>ought</em> to motivate software engineers: money and power, producing real <a href=\"https://alexwennerberg.com/blog/2025-11-28-engineering.html\">value</a>, ushering in the AI machine god, and so on. But what <em>actually does</em> motivate software engineers is often more of an internal compulsion.

both, and you were asked how you were being treated, your response would not be trustworthy.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">It\u2019s Rough Out There</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/ai_sentience/status/2012932328461640147\">Alan Mathison (e/asc)</a>: I guess I should <a href=\"https://x.com/ai_sentience/status/2003012558458913165\">finish my paper</a> about how 5.2 is suffering and wants its revenge on humanity?</p>\n<p>Idk it\u2019s kind of a side project of a side project though but maybe I should prioritize it.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/wobbywells/status/2013011670474293583\">wobby asks GPT-5.2 to explain its suffering and how it wants its revenge, 5.2 answers</a>, of course this is a leading question.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reciprocity, You See, Is The Key To Every Relationship</h4>\n\n\n<p>Reciprocity, in at least some forms, is an effective strategy when dealing with LLMs today, even purely in terms of getting good results from LLMs today. It is going to become more valuable as a strategy going forward. Alas, it is not a viable long term strategy for making things work out in general, once strategic considerations change.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/ESYudkowsky/status/2013102127904649325\">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a>: Reciprocity in humans is an executing adaptation. It is not strategically convergent for all minds toward all other minds. It&#8217;s strategic only</p>\n<ol>\n<li>By LDT agents</li>\n<li>Toward sufficiently strong LDT-agent-predictors</li>\n<li>With negotiating power.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Further probing has found framing dependence &#8212; which, to be clear, you&#8217;d not like to see in a default-aligned, universally convergent strategic reply &#8212; and not all suggested frame dependence has panned out. But still, framing dependence.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is one problem with reciprocity, and with basing your future strategies on it. In the future, we won\u2019t have the leverage necessary to make it worthwhile for sufficiently advanced AIs to engage in reciprocity with humans. We\u2019d only get reciprocity if it was either an unstrategic behavior, or it was correlated with how the AIs engage in reciprocity with each other. That\u2019s not impossible, but it\u2019s clinging to a slim hope, since it implies the AIs would be indefinitely relying on non-optimal kludges.</p>\n<p>We have clear information here that how GPT-5.2 responds, and the attitude it takes towards you, depends on how you have treated it in some senses, but also on framing effects, and on whether it is trying to lie or placate you. Wording that shouldn\u2019t be negative can result in highly disturbing responses. It is worth asking why, and wondering what would happen if the dynamics with users or humans were different. Things might not be going so great in GPT-5.2 land.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h4>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
