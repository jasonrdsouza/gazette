These are API-only models right now, not available through the ChatGPT interface (though you can try them out in OpenAI's <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/playground\">API playground</a>). All three models can handle 1,047,576 tokens of input and 32,768 tokens of output, and all three have a May 31, 2024 cut-off date (their previous models were mostly September 2023).</p> <p>The models score higher than GPT-4o <em>and</em> GPT-4.5 on coding benchmarks, and do very well on long context benchmarks as well. They also claim improvements in instruction following - following requested formats, obeying negative instructions, sorting output and obeying instructions to say \"I don't know\".</p> <p>I released a new version of my <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-openai-plugin\">llm-openai</a> plugin supporting the new models. This is a new thing for the <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/\">LLM</a> ecosystem: previously OpenAI models were only supported in core, which meant I had to ship a full LLM release to add support for them.</p> <p>You can run the new models like this:</p> <div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>llm install llm-openai-plugin -U llm -m openai/gpt-4.1 <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span></pre></div> <p>The other model IDs are <code>openai/gpt-4.1-mini</code> and <code>openai/gpt-4.1-nano</code>.</p> <p>Here's the <a",
