                "<p>Here\u2019s our story so far:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Markets are a good way to know what people really think. When India and Pakistan started firing missiles at each other on May 7, I was concerned, what with them both having nuclear weapons. But then I looked at world market prices:\n<img alt=\"MSCI prices\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/futarchy-market/msci.svg\" />\nSee how it crashes on May 7? Me neither. I found that reassuring.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>But we care about lots of stuff that isn\u2019t always reflected in stock prices, e.g. the outcomes of elections or drug trials. So why not create markets for those, too? If you create contracts that pay out $1 only if some drug trial succeeds, then the prices will reflect what people \u201creally\u201d think.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>In fact, why don\u2019t we use markets to make decisions? Say you\u2019ve invented two new drugs, but only have enough money to run one trial. Why don\u2019t you create markets for both drugs, then run the trial on the drug that gets a higher price? Contracts for the \u201cwinning\u201d drug are resolved based on the trial, while contracts in the other market are cancelled so everyone gets their money back. That\u2019s the idea of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futarchy\">Futarchy</a>, which Robin Hanson proposed in 2007.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Why don\u2019t we? Well, maybe it won\u2019t work. In 2022, I wrote a <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/prediction-market-causation/\">post</a> arguing that when you cancel one of the markets, you screw up the incentives for how people should bid, meaning prices won\u2019t reflect the causal impact of different choices. I suggested prices reflect \u201ccorrelation\u201d rather than causation, for basically the same reason this happens with observational statistics. This post, it was magnificent.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>It didn\u2019t convince anyone.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Years went by. I spent a lot of time reading <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/bourdieu/\">Bourdieu</a> and worrying about why I buy certain kinds of beer. Gradually I discovered that essentially the same point about futarchy had been made earlier by, e.g., <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xnC68ZfTkPyzXQS8p/prediction-markets-are-confounded-implications-for-the\">Anders_H</a> in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf0670375432/futarchy-fix\">abramdemski</a> in 2017, and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/E4QnGsXLEEcNysADT/issues-with-futarchy\">Luzka</a> in 2021.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>In early 2025, I went to a conference and got into a bunch of (friendly) debates about this. I was astonished to find that verbally repeating the arguments from my post did not convince anyone. I even immodestly asked one person to read my post on the spot. (Bloggers: Do not do that.) That sort of worked.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>So, I decided to try again. I wrote another post called <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/futarchy/\">\u201d<del>Futarky\u2019s</del> Futarchy\u2019s fundamental flaw\u201d</a>. It made the same argument with more aggression, with clearer examples, and with a new impossibility theorem that showed there doesn\u2019t even exist any alternate payout function that would incentivize people to bid according to their causal beliefs.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That post\u2026 also didn\u2019t convince anyone. In the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vqzarZEczxiFdLE39/futarchy-s-fundamental-flaw#comments\">discussion on LessWrong</a>, many of my comments are upvoted for quality but downvoted for accuracy, which I think means, \u201cnice try champ; have a head pat; nah.\u201d Robin Hanson wrote an <a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/decision-conditional-prices-reflect\">response</a>, albeit without outward evidence of reading beyond the first paragraph. Even the people who <em>agreed</em> with me often seemed to interpret me as arguing that futarchy satisfies <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidential_decision_theory\">evidential decision theory</a> rather than <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_decision_theory\">causal decision theory</a>. Which was weird, given that I never mentioned either of those, don\u2019t accept the premise the futarchy satisfies either of them, and don\u2019t find the distinction helpful in this context.</p>\n\n<p>In my darkest moments, I started to wonder if I might fail to achieve worldwide consensus that futarchy doesn\u2019t estimate causal effects. I figured I\u2019d wait a few years and then launch another salvo.</p>\n\n<p>But then, legendary human <a href=\"https://thequantummilkman.substack.com/\">Bolton Bailey</a> decided to stop theorizing and take one of my thought experiments and turn it into an <em>actual</em> experiment. Thus, <a href=\"https://manifold.markets/BoltonBailey/futarchys-fundamental-flaw-the-mark\">Futarchy\u2019s fundamental flaw \u2014 the market</a> was born. (You are now reading a blog post about that market.)</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"june-25\">June 25</h2>\n\n<p>I gave a <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/futarchy/#:~:text=Suppose%20there%E2%80%99s%20a%20conditional%20prediction%20market%20for%20two%20coins%2E\">thought experiment</a> where there are two coins and the market is trying to pick the one that\u2019s more likely to land heads. For one coin, the bias is known, while for the other coin there\u2019s uncertainty. I claimed futarchy would select the worse / wrong coin, due to this extra uncertainty.</p>\n\n<p>Bolton formalized this as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>There are two markets, one for coin A and one for coin B.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Coin A is a normal coin that lands heads 60% of the time.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Coin B is a trick coin that <em>either</em> always lands heads or always lands tails, we just don\u2019t know which. There\u2019s a 59% it\u2019s an always-heads coin.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Twenty-four hours before markets close, the true nature of coin B is revealed.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>After the markets closes, whichever coin has a higher price is flipped and contracts pay out $1 for heads and $0 for tails. The other market is cancelled so everyone gets their money back.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Get that? Everyone knows that there\u2019s a 60% chance coin A will land heads and a 59% chance coin B will land heads. But for coin A, that represents true \u201caleatoric\u201d uncertainty, while for coin B that represents \u201cepistemic\u201d uncertainty due to a lack of knowledge. (See <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/bayes/\">Bayes is not a phase</a> for more on \u201caleatoric\u201d vs. \u201cepistemic\u201d uncertainty.)</p>\n\n<p>Bolton created that market independently. At the time, we\u2019d never communicated about this or anything else. To this day, I have no idea what he thinks about my argument or what he expected to happen.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"june-26-27\">June 26-27</h2>\n\n<p>In the forum for the market, there was a lot of debate about \u201cwhalebait\u201d. Here\u2019s the concern: Say you\u2019ve bought a lot of contracts for coin B, but it emerges that coin B is always-tails. If you have a lot of money, then you might go in at the last second and buy a ton of contracts on coin A to try to force the market price above coin B, so the coin B market is cancelled and you get your money back.</p>\n\n<p>The conversation seemed to converge towards the idea that this <em>was</em> whalebait. Though notice that if you\u2019re buying contracts for coin A at any price above $0.60, you\u2019re basically giving away free money. It could still work, but it\u2019s dangerous and everyone else has an incentive to stop you. If I was betting in this market, I\u2019d think that this was at least <em>unlikely</em>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"june-27\">June 27</h2>\n\n<p>Bolton <a href=\"https://dynomight.substack.com/p/futarky/comment/129923488\">posted</a> about the market. When I first saw the rules, I thought it wasn\u2019t a valid test of my theory and wasted a huge amount of Bolton\u2019s time trying to propose other experiments that would \u201cfix\u201d it. Bolton was very patient, but I eventually realized that it was completely fine and there was nothing to fix.</p>\n\n<p>At the time, this is what the prices looked like:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/futarchy-market/market01.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>That is, at the time, both coins were priced at $0.60, which is not what I had predicted. Nevertheless, I <a href=\"https://dynomight.substack.com/p/futarky/comment/129923488\">publicly agreed</a> that this was a valid test of my claims.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I think this is a great test and look forward to seeing the results.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Let me reiterate why I thought the markets were wrong and coin B deserved a higher price. There\u2019s a 59% chance coin B would turns out to be all-heads. If that happened, then (absent whales being baited) I thought the coin B market would activate, so contracts are worth $1. So thats 59% \u00d7 $1 = $0.59 of value. But if coin B turns out to be all-tails, I thought there is a good chance prices for coin B would drop below coin A, so the market is cancelled and you get your money back. So I thought a contract <em>had</em> to be worth more than $0.59.</p>\n\n<details>\n  You can quantify this with a little math. Even if you think the coin B market only has a 50% chance of being cancelled if B is revealed to be all tails, a contract would still be worth $0.7421.\n\n\n  <p>If you buy a contract for coin B for $0.70, then I think that\u2019s worth</p>\n\n  <div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>P[all-heads] \u00d7 P[market activates | all-heads] \u00d7 $1\n   + P[all-tails] \u00d7 P[market cancelled | all-tails] \u00d7 $0.70\n = 0.59  \u00d7 $1\n   + 0.41 \u00d7 P[market cancelled | all-tails] \u00d7 $0.70\n = $0.59\n   + $0.287 \u00d7 P[market cancelled | all-tails]\n</code></pre></div>  </div>\n\n  <p>Surely <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">P[market cancelled | all-tails]</code> isn\u2019t <em>that</em> low. So surely this is worth more than $0.59.</p>\n\n  <p>More generally, say you buy a YES contract for coin B for $M. Then that contract would be worth</p>\n\n  <div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>P[all-heads] \u00d7 $1 \u00d7 P[market activates | all-heads]\n   + P[all-tails] \u00d7 $M \u00d7 P[market cancelled | all-tails]\n = $0.59\n   + 0.41 \u00d7 $M \u00d7 P[market cancelled | all-tails]\n</code></pre></div>  </div>\n\n  <p>It\u2019s not hard to show that the breakeven price is</p>\n\n  <div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>M = $0.59 /  (1 - 0.41 \u00d7 P[market cancelled | all-tails]).\n</code></pre></div>  </div>\n\n  <p>Even if you thought <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">P[market cancelled | all-tails]</code> was only 50%, then the breakeven price would still be $0.7421.</p>\n\n</details>\n\n<h2 id=\"june-27-later\">June 27 (later)</h2>\n\n<p>Within a few hours, a few people bought contracts on coin B, driving up the price.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/futarchy-market/market02.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>Then, Quroe <a href=\"https://manifold.markets/BoltonBailey/futarchys-fundamental-flaw-the-mark#hfkymtc8qx6\">proposed</a> creating derivative markets.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In theory, if there was a market asking if coin A was going to resolve YES, NO, or N/A, supposedly people could arbitrage their bets accordingly and make this market calibrated.</p>\n\n  <p>Same for a similar market on coin B.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, <a href=\"https://manifold.markets/Quroe/futarchys-fundamental-fix-coin-a\">Futarchy\u2019s Fundamental Fix - Coin A</a> and <a href=\"https://manifold.markets/Quroe/futarchys-fundamental-fix-coin-b\">Futarchy\u2019s Fundamental Fix - Coin B</a> came to be. These were markets in which people could bid on the probability that each coin would resolve YES, meaning the coin was flipped and landed heads, NO, meaning the coin was flipped and landed heads, or N/A, meaning the market was cancelled.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, I didn\u2019t understand this. I saw no reason that these derivative markets would make people bid their true beliefs. If they did, then my whole theory that markets reflect correlation rather than causation would be invalidated.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"june-28---july-5\">June 28 - July 5</h2>\n\n<p>Prices for coin B went up and down, but mostly up.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/futarchy-market/market03.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>Eventually, a few people created large limit orders, which caused things to stabilize.</p>\n\n<details>\n  \nMeanwhile, the derivatives markets did not cause the price of coin B to drop. They basically didn't change anything.\n\n  <p>Here was the derivative market for coin A.</p>\n\n  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/futarchy-market/fix-a01.png\" /></p>\n\n  <p>And here it was market for coin B.</p>\n\n  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/futarchy-market/fix-b01.png\" /></p>\n\n</details>\n\n<h2 id=\"july-6---july-24\">July 6 - July 24</h2>\n\n<p>During this period, not a whole hell of a lot happened.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/futarchy-market/market04.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>This brings us up to the moment of truth, when the true nature of coin B was to be revealed. At this point, coin B was at $0.90, even though everyone knows it only has a 59% chance of being heads.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"july-25\">July 25</h2>\n\n<p>The nature of the coin was revealed. To show this was fair, Bolton did this by asking a bot to publicly generate a random number.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/futarchy-market/truth01.png\" /></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/futarchy-market/truth02.png\" /></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/futarchy-market/truth03.png\" /></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/futarchy-market/truth04.png\" /></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/futarchy-market/truth05.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>Thus, coin B was determined to be always-heads.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"july-26-27\">July 26-27</h2>\n\n<p>There were still 24 hours left to bid. At this point, a contract for coin B was guaranteed to pay out $1. The market quickly jumped to $1.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/futarchy-market/market05.png\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n\n<p>I was right. Everyone knew coin A had a higher chance of being heads than coin B, but everyone bid the price of coin B way above coin A anyway.</p>\n\n<details>\n  \nIt's a bit sad that B wasn't revealed to be all-tails. If it had, we could have seen if the price for coin B actually crashed to below that for coin A. But given that coin B had a price of $0.90, we know the *market* expected it to crash. In fact, if you do a little math, you can put a number on this and say the market thought there was an 84% chance the market for coin B would indeed crash if revealed to be all-tails.\n\n\n  <p>In the previous math box, we saw that the breakeven price should satisfy</p>\n\n  <div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>M = $0.59 /  (1 - 0.41 \u00d7 P[market cancelled | all-tails]).\n</code></pre></div>  </div>\n\n  <p>If you invert this and plug in M=$0.90, then you get</p>\n\n  <div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>P[market cancelled | all-tails]\n = (1 - $0.59 / M) / 0.41\n = (1 - $0.59 / $0.9) / 0.41\n = 84.01%\n</code></pre></div>  </div>\n\n</details>\n\n<p>I\u2019ll now open the floor for questions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"isnt-this-market-unrealistic\">Isn\u2019t this market unrealistic?</h3>\n\n<p>Yes, but that\u2019s kind of the point. I created the thought experiment because I wanted to make the problem maximally obvious, because it\u2019s subtle and everyone is determined to deny that it exists.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"isnt-this-just-a-weird-probability-thing-why-does-this-show-futarchy-is-flawed\">Isn\u2019t this just a weird probability thing? Why does this show futarchy is flawed?</h3>\n\n<p>The fact that this is <em>possible</em> is concerning. If this <em>can</em> happen, then futarchy does not work <em>in general</em>. If you want to claim that futarchy works, then you need to spell out exactly what extra assumptions you\u2019re adding to guarantee that this kind of thing won\u2019t happen.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"but-prices-did-reflect-causality-when-the-market-closed-doesnt-that-mean-this-isnt-a-valid-test\">But prices <em>did</em> reflect causality when the market closed! Doesn\u2019t that mean this isn\u2019t a valid test?</h3>\n\n<p>No. That\u2019s just a quirk of the implementation. You can easily create situations that would have the same issue all the way through market close. Here\u2019s one way you could do that:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Let coin A be heads with probability 60%. This is public information.</li>\n  <li>Let coin B be an ALWAYS HEADS coin with probability 59% and ALWAYS TAILS coin with probability 41%. This is a secret.</li>\n  <li>Every day, generate a random integer between 1 and 30.\n    <ol>\n      <li>If it\u2019s 1, immediately resolve the markets.</li>\n      <li>It it\u2019s 2, reveal the nature of coin B.</li>\n      <li>If it\u2019s between 3 and 30, do nothing.</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>On average, this market will run for 30 days. (The length follows a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution\">geometric distribution</a>). Half the time, the market will close without the nature of coin B being revealed. Even when that happens, I claim the price for coin B will still be above coin A.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"if-futarchy-is-flawed-shouldnt-you-be-able-to-show-that-without-this-weird-step-of-revealing-coin-b\">If futarchy is flawed, shouldn\u2019t you be able to show that without this weird step of \u201crevealing\u201d coin B?</h3>\n\n<p>Yes. You should be able to do that, and I think you can. Here\u2019s one way:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Let coin A be heads with probability 60%. This is public information.</li>\n  <li>Sample 20 random bits, e.g. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">10100011001100000001</code>. Let coin B be heads with probability (49+N)% where N is the number of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1</code> bits. do not reveal these bits publicly.</li>\n  <li>Secretly send these bits to the first 20 people who ask.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<details>\n  (You could implement this in a forum by using public and private keys.)\n  <p>First, have users generate public keys by running this command:</p>\n\n  <div class=\"language-bash highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>openssl genrsa 1024 <span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> private.pem\nopenssl rsa <span class=\"nt\">-in</span> private.pem <span class=\"nt\">-pubout</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> public.pem\n</code></pre></div>  </div>\n  <p>Second, they should post the contents of the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">public_key.pem</code> when asking for their bit. For example:</p>\n  <div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Hi, can you please send me a bit? Here's my public key:\n\n-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDOlesWS+mnvHJOD2osUkbrxE+Y\nPMqAUYqwemOwML0LlWLq5RobZRSeyssQhg0i3g2GsMZFMsvjindz6mxccdyP4M8N\nmQVCK1Ovs1Z4+DxwmLf/y8vaGC3vfZBOhJDdaNdpRyUiQFaBW99We4cafVnmirRN\nPy2lRe+CFgP3kSp4dQIDAQAB\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n</code></pre></div>  </div>\n\n  <p>Third, whoever is running the market should save that key as <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">public.pem</code>, pick a pit, and encrypt it like this:</p>\n\n  <p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">% echo \"your secret bit is 1\" | openssl pkeyutl -encrypt -pubin -inkey public.pem | base64</code></p>\n\n  <p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">OuHt25Jwc1xYq63Ub8gOLKaZEJwwGHWDL0UGfydmvBapQNKf3l6Akol2Z2XHtCAC8G/lPJsCjb1dN878tU0aCMjbO5EvpMUTuohb0OczaCqAMld8uFL+j+uEZsIjKFT3Q52VumdVqMntJYG6Br6QeUs1vAL2HA6Nvych+Ao2e8M=</code></p>\n\n  <p>Users can then decrypt like this:</p>\n\n  <p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">% echo \"OuHt25Jwc1xYq63Ub8gOLKaZEJwwGHWDL0UGfydmvBapQNKf3l6Akol2Z2XHtCAC8G/lPJsCjb1dN878tU0aCMjbO5EvpMUTuohb0OczaCqAMld8uFL+j+uEZsIjKFT3Q52VumdVqMntJYG6Br6QeUs1vAL2HA6Nvych+Ao2e8M=\" | base64 -d | openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -inkey private.pem</code></p>\n\n  <p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">your secret bit is 1</code></p>\n\n  <p>Or you could use email\u2026</p>\n</details>\n\n<p>I think this market captures a dynamic that\u2019s present in basically any use of futarchy: You have some information, but you know other information is out there.</p>\n\n<p>I claim that this market\u2014will be weird. Say it just opened. If you didn\u2019t get a bit, then as far as you know, the bias for coin B could be anywhere between 49% and 69%, with a mean of 59%. If you <em>did</em> get a bit, then it turns out that the posterior mean is 58.5% if you got a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">0</code> and 59.5% if you got a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1</code>. So either way, your best guess is very close to 59%.</p>\n\n<p>However, the information for the true bias of coin B is out there! Surely coin B is more likely to end up with a higher price in situations where there are lots of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1</code> bits. This means you should bid at least a little higher than your true belief, for the same reason as the main experiment\u2014the market activating is correlated with the true bias of coin B.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, after the markets open, people will see each other\u2019s bids and\u2026 something will happen. Initially, I think prices will be strongly biased for the above reasons. But as you get closer to market close, there\u2019s less time for information to spread. If you are the last person to trade you <em>know</em> you\u2019re the last person to trade, then you should do so based on your true beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>Except, <em>everyone knows</em> that there\u2019s less time for information to spread. So while you are waiting till the last minute to reveal your true beliefs, everyone else will do the same thing. So maybe people sort of rush in at the last second? (It would be easier to think about this if implemented with <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rS6tKxSWkYBgxmsma/many-prediction-markets-would-be-better-off-as-batched\">batched auctions</a> rather than a real-time market.)</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, while the game theory is vexing, I think there\u2019s a mix of (1) people bidding higher than their true beliefs due to correlations between the final price and the true bias of coin B and (2) people \u201cracing\u201d to make the final bid before the markets close. Both of these seem in conflict with the idea of prediction markets making people share information and measure collective beliefs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"why-do-you-hate-futarchy\">Why do you hate futarchy?</h3>\n\n<p>I like futarchy.

                "<p>The &#8220;amyloid hypothesis&#8221; says that Alzheimer&#8217;s is caused by accumulation of the peptide amyloid-&#946;.

Meanwhile, mainstream scientists . . . continue to believe it without really offering any public defense. Scott was so surprised by the size of the gap between official and unofficial opinion that he asked if someone from the orthodox camp would speak out in its favor.</p><p>I am <a href=\"https://thedavidsj.substack.com/\">David Schneider-Joseph</a>, an engineer formerly with SpaceX and Google, now working in AI safety. Alzheimer&#8217;s isn&#8217;t my field, but I got very interested in it, spent six months studying the literature, and came away believing the amyloid hypothesis was basically completely solid. I thought I&#8217;d share that understanding with current skeptics.</p><h2>The ATN model</h2><p>The most plausible variant of the amyloid hypothesis is the A &#8594; T &#8594; N model: amyloid causes tau causes neurodegeneration.</p><h4>1: Amyloid</h4><p>The common entrypoint, typically at least 15 years before clinically detectable symptoms [1], is accumulation of amyloid-&#946; deposits (especially A&#946;42, one of several variants).</p><p>Amyloid-&#946; is a peptide produced in healthy human beings and many other animals, probably for antimicrobial purposes [2, 3].</p><p>Factors which cause overproduction of amyloid also cause Alzheimer&#8217;s. Factors that cause decreased clearance of amyloid also cause Alzheimer&#8217;s. The clearest relationship is various genes which massively increase amyloid production (while doing nothing else); these genes are Alzheimer&#8217;s risk factors, with some of the rarer and more severe ones causing extreme versions of the disease that manifest at otherwise almost-never-seen ages.</p><p>One of the clearest examples is Down syndrome, which is caused by three (rather than the usual two) copies of chromosome 21. People with Down syndrome are at much higher risk of Alzheimer&#8217;s than the general population: two-thirds will have the condition by age sixty, and 15% have it by age <em>forty.</em></p><p>APP, the gene for the amyloid precursor protein, is on chromosome 21. This means that people with Down syndrome will have an extra copy. This extra copy has been observed to lead to higher-than-normal amyloid levels. But there are many genes on chromosome 21; do we have additional evidence that it&#8217;s the amyloid one that&#8217;s involved?</p><p>Yes. Dozens of other mutations on APP cause the same sort of extremely young and severe Alzheimer&#8217;s. So do mutations on PSEN1 and 2, the genes for the enzyme that processes amyloid precursor protein into amyloid. So do mutations on several other amyloid-related genes. [6, 91 - 96] Researchers call these <em>autosomal-dominant</em> Alzheimer&#8217;s, meaning Alzheimer&#8217;s cases that get inherited from a single parent in a simple fashion typical of single-gene disorders. They make up about 1% of all cases, and are our strongest evidence for the causal role of amyloid in the disorder. To my knowledge, there is no serious claim that these genes could be working through any pathway other than their shared role in the amyloid system.</p><p>But these autosomal-dominant cases only make up about 1% of all Alzheimer&#8217;s patients. Might they be a different disease than the usual sporadic Alzheimer&#8217;s that strikes people without strong family histories at normal ages?</p><p>Probably not: the presentation and trajectory of autosomal-dominant and sporadic Alzheimer&#8217;s cases are strikingly similar. Both show an initial appearance of amyloid pathology starting in intrinsic connectivity networks in both autosomal-dominant [14] and sporadic [15&#8211;18] types, cortical tau appearing first in the medial temporal lobe and with the exact same fold in both disease types [97] (despite human tauopathies having at least seven other possible characteristic folds [36]), that tau pathology worsening and spreading outside this region only once amyloid pathology reaches sufficient severity [65], neurodegeneration progressing closely in step with the tau pathology, and the same usual approximate trajectory of cognitive symptoms due to the sequence of affected regions. So it&#8217;s as if two bank robberies occurred hours apart, in the same town, and in a highly similar and idiosyncratic manner, and we can positively identify the culprit of one on security camera footage. It&#8217;s a good bet the culprit of the other is the same.</p><p>Increased amyloid production &#8594; Alzheimer&#8217;s is an especially clear and simple pathway, but any other change in amyloid can also cause the disease. For example</p><ul><li><p><strong>Overproduction or reduced clearance of amyloid due to impaired slow wave sleep</strong>. A&#946; production is neuronal activity-dependent, and toxins (perhaps including A&#946;) are cleared from the brain during sleep via the glymphatic system. Thus A&#946; can accumulate if the brain is more active and/or has less opportunity for clearance. [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]</p></li><li><p><strong>Impaired amyloid clearance due to having one or (much worse) two copies of ApoE4</strong> [12], which is by far the most common genetic risk factor. The mechanism here may be a loss of function in microglia, a type of immune cell in the brain which helps clear plaques. [13]</p></li><li><p><strong>Overproduction or reduced clearance due to microbial infection.</strong> Amyloid-&#946; appears to be an antimicrobial peptide and will form plaques in response to infection. [2, 3] This explains various observations that have been used to support the &#8220;infectious hypothesis&#8221;, sometimes proposed as an alternative to the amyloid hypothesis. However, it can only explain a subset of cases and, as I argue<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/130cgtEEwnwPStrsmOFEIOAZk1wq_siFNAKIMhWdvMuM/edit#bookmark=id.ptfizr39bkt3\"> below</a>, is even then still <em>mediated</em> by amyloid via an &#8220;IATN&#8221; pathway: infection &#8594; amyloid &#8594; tau &#8594; neurodegeneration.</p></li></ul><p>In cases of increased production, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will show elevated amyloid. In cases of reduced clearance, amyloid will <em>decrease</em> in CSF. In all cases, however, PET scans will show elevated brain amyloid, usually at first mainly in &#8220;intrinsic connectivity networks&#8221; such as the default mode network [14&#8211;20], which experience brain activity even at rest. These neurons are the most active - which causes more production and possibly less opportunity for clearance - so they tend to be the first to suffer from a production/clearance imbalance.</p><p>Over time, amyloid pathology spreads spatially throughout the brain. [14, 18] Aggregations of amyloid peptides induce more such aggregations. Some of our clearest evidence for this comes from growth hormone deficiency patients, who used to have cadaver-derived ground-up brain matter injected into their own brains to provide the missing hormones. If the ground-up brain matter was sourced from the corpse of an Alzheimer&#8217;s patient, the growth hormone deficiency patients would themselves develop Alzheimer&#8217;s at a young age,<a href=\"https://www.gwasstories.com/p/the-first-case-reports-of-human-to\"> probably through prion-like spread of the misfolded proteins</a>. [21, 22]</p><p>After &#8764;15 years of preclinical spread, the pathology eventually covers the whole brain. [14, 18] While some subtle cognitive impairment may occur during this time, it is usually not severe enough to be clinically detectable from amyloid alone. Indeed, in both humans [23&#8211;30] and mice [31&#8211;35], the severity of neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits is not a good spatiotemporal match for the severity of amyloid pathology (rather, it is a good match for the severity of tau pathology; see next section for more). These facts are often suggested as evidence against the amyloid hypothesis. However, amyloid is causally upstream of tau, as I will argue below. Therefore, the existence of cognitively normal individuals with amyloid pathology is expected in the ATN model - but typically only for a few decades, before progression to the next stage.</p><h4>2: Tau pathology (T) and neurodegeneration (N)</h4><p><em>Tauopathies</em> are a range of prion-like diseases involving the tau protein [36], whose usual function is to assist in stabilizing microtubule structure. In a tauopathy, the tau protein misfolds, and induces other, nearby tau proteins to misfold into the same shape. [37&#8211;46]. Injecting nothing but misfolded tau fibrils into a mouse brain can recruit the endogenously-produced mouse tau into this pathology, which spreads far beyond the injection site, causing neurodegeneration wherever it goes. [35, 47&#8211;59]</p><p>There are at least eight distinct ways the tau protein can misfold in human disease [36], and over a dozen distinct human tauopathies, each involving a specific one of those misfoldings. These include chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Pick&#8217;s disease, corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, with the last by far the most common. Each of these five diseases has its own distinct tau fold.</p><p>Most normal human beings eventually develop some tau pathology in adulthood, originating probably in the locus coeruleus [60&#8211;62], which is part of the brainstem. By middle age, some amount has usually spread to the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in the medial temporal lobe, regions responsible for episodic memory. This is called primary age-related tauopathy (PART) [63], and has its own tau fold which is distinct from most tauopathies, but the same as Alzheimer&#8217;s. [36, 64] Usually, its local severity is mild and it doesn&#8217;t spread much beyond those regions. But with sufficient amyloid pathology, this &#8220;normal&#8221; tau pathology tends to both locally worsen and spread through the rest of the brain [65], becoming the tau pathology of Alzheimer&#8217;s.</p><p>Some genetic risk factors such as ApoE, in addition to affecting the clearance of amyloid-&#946;, also increase the brain&#8217;s susceptibility to this A &#8594; T pathology conversion [66, 67]. But this is a matter of degree, as <em>sufficient</em> amyloid pathology seems to virtually guarantee the transition: Every<a href=\"https://www.gaain.org/centiloid-project\"> 10-centiloid</a> increase in amyloid pathology for a cognitively normal individual increases by 2.7x the probability of a PET scan detecting pathological levels of tau within five years [68]. The only known cases where patients with extremely high amyloid levels can go significant amounts of time without developing tau pathology are a few individuals with extremely rare protective genes, known only from a few case studies, e.g. [69]. Even in these instances, the individuals will eventually succumb to the tau phase, suffering neural atrophy and dementia. [70]</p><p>After it forms, the tau pathology no longer appears to require amyloid&#8217;s assistance to keep spreading (although amyloid may still accelerate it). This probably explains why existing anti-amyloid therapies<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/130cgtEEwnwPStrsmOFEIOAZk1wq_siFNAKIMhWdvMuM/edit#bookmark=id.ihc42bbb5bpo\"> have been</a> only &#8764;30% effective in test patients, who are usually late in the amyloid &#8594; tau progression even if early in having symptomatic disease.</p><p>Neurodegeneration follows tau pathology extremely closely in time and space, in humans as well as basically all animal models, and cognitive impairments match the functions of the affected regions. There are rare reports of advanced tau pathology without cognitive decline, often in people with protective ApoE2 alleles [71], but even then, systematic analysis finds that actual density of tau inclusions is highly predictive of cognitive impairment, and that these exceptional cases usually involve widespread but <em>locally sparse</em> pathology [66].</p><p>The regional distribution of tau pathology explains why the first symptom of Alzheimer&#8217;s is typically impaired memory; the first cortical sites affected are usually in regions involved in memory formation. As the pathology spreads, further regions are affected, until eventually all cognitive functions are affected. As with most other aspects of the disease, the high-level picture seems relatively clear but the exact cellular and molecular pathways are not well understood (though may involve an assist from the innate immune system, especially microglia and astrocytes. [13, 35, 72])</p><p>Early Alzheimer mouse models were amyloid-only, with extremely heavy overproduction of A&#946;, much more than required to recapitulate the human disease, and apparently enough to cause detectable cognitive dysfunction. However, normal mice do not get age-related tauopathy, so an amyloid-only mouse model - while useful for investigating certain questions - is not a full Alzheimer&#8217;s disease model.</p><p>Combined amyloid+tau pathology mouse models, which are transgenically modified and/or injected with misfolded human tau fibrils, display the property that<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/130cgtEEwnwPStrsmOFEIOAZk1wq_siFNAKIMhWdvMuM/edit#bookmark=id.pw1ydynatz5u\"> the presence of amyloid pathology induces the worsening and spreading of tau pathology</a>. This is also observed <em>in vitro</em> in human cells.</p><p>How do we know the amyloid causes the tau? Researchers have measured the correlation in many ways, from the spatiotemporal timeline (tau pathology only begins locally worsening and spreading outside the medial temporal lobe once amyloid reaches sufficient severity) [65], [98], to causal mediation modeling in the human disease [26], [99&#8211;101], to causal intervention using in vitro human cell studies [54, 102] and animal models [35, 55], [103 &#8211; 113]. But also, giving people drugs that reduce amyloid levels also decreases tau pathology. [78, 80, 82]</p><p>(I&#8217;ve left out or merely alluded to much other complexity, involving the innate immune system, lipid processing, and detailed molecular and cellular mechanisms, preferring to focus on the parts of the story which are crucial to deciding the causal role of amyloid, and for which I am aware of a satisfactory account from the literature. But I don&#8217;t intend to leave the impression that the above is all there is to Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, or that all cases progress in the same exact way.)</p><h2>The mechanistic claims</h2><p>I make the following two claims about amyloid-&#946;&#8217;s role in Alzheimer&#8217;s:</p><ol><li><p>Amyloid deposits are a necessary (i.e. but-for) cause in all instances of Alzheimer dementia. That is, <strong>if</strong> someone has PET or CSF positivity for amyloid and tau pathologies, <em>and</em> the tau pathology involves the Alzheimer tau fold and made its first cortical appearance in the medial temporal lobe, <em>and</em> then they developed medial temporal volume loss + amnestic mild cognitive impairment + later dementia, <strong>then counterfactually,</strong> early enough (probably &#8764;15 years before clinical presentation) causal intervention solely to remove the amyloid deposits would have prevented almost all tau pathology and symptoms.</p></li><li><p>Severe enough amyloid pathology is a sufficient cause of Alzheimer dementia in almost all brains. That is, <strong>if</strong> someone is PET- or CSF-positive for very severe amyloid pathology (such as the level resulting from typical cases of autosomal-dominant overproduction), lack extremely rare protective genetics preventing further disease progression [69], and is not treated with any recent medical interventions, <strong>then</strong> they will eventually (after typically 15-20 years, and rarely more than 30), develop tau pathology and neurodegeneration in the region of this tau pathology (unless some other disease kills them first). Usually this will start in the medial temporal lobe and affect memory, then spread to other regions and functions.</p></li></ol><p>Mechanistic claims I am <em>not</em> making:</p><ol><li><p>I am <em>not</em> claiming that environmental factors such as microbial infection can never be a cause of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. However, I claim that in all such cases, they act upstream of the above-described disease process, inducing the formation of amyloid deposits leading to the disease. Furthermore, these cannot be all cases - there are instances of the disease in which amyloid deposits arise essentially entirely due to genetic factors (like the autosomal-dominant cases of overproduction).</p></li><li><p>I am <em>not</em> claiming that the disease is &#8220;as simple as&#8221; amyloid deposits directly inducing neurodegeneration. As described above, they act indirectly, via the eventual downstream tau pathology, and possibly an associated microglial/astrocytic inflammatory response. Therefore, there are many people in the preclinical, amyloid-only disease phase who will eventually progress to dementia but have not yet.</p></li></ol><p>These two clarifications imply that even though amyloid pathology is a necessary and (in enough severity) sufficient cause of the disease under normal circumstances, therapies with other targets might still be effective, either intervening upstream such that amyloid deposits never occur, or downstream so as to prevent the neurodegenerative process.</p><h2>The testable prediction</h2><p>I would bet on the following: A therapy whose sole intended mechanism involves amyloid production or clearance, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, will, in the next 12 years, achieve a slowdown of cognitive decline of at least 75%, with a p-value below 0.001, in its preregistered primary cognitive endpoint (or an average of all such endpoints if more than one exists). I&#8217;d eventually expect better than 75% efficacy, but getting stuff to work takes time, and I wanted to make a prediction which can be tested in a reasonable timeframe.</p><p>On the other hand, if a clinical trial completes earlier than 12 years from now (perhaps [73], reading out in 2027), sustains extremely good amyloid clearance at the preclinical stage, and has a good safety profile, but doesn&#8217;t make substantial progress towards this 75% goal, then I would consider this prediction refuted in advance.</p><p>For targeting amyloid, I&#8217;m most optimistic about a blood brain barrier (BBB)-penetrating antibody such as trontinemab [74&#8211;76], but with an epitope more like lecanemab&#8217;s, and given in the preclinical disease stage. Other options for targeting amyloid include antisense oligonucleotides for APP as well as &#947;-secretase modulators.</p><h2>The successes and failures of amyloid antibodies</h2><p>There have now been three amyloid antibodies with positive phase 3 (and earlier) clinical trials on cognitive endpoints (but with much less than 75% efficacy):</p><ol><li><p><strong>Aducanumab</strong> in phase 1b [77] (<strong>19%</strong> on my average across cognitive endpoints for the highest two doses) and one of two phase 3 trials [78] <strong>(22%</strong>, but <strong>negative 2%</strong> in the other trial, which also gave a lower dose on average).</p></li><li><p><strong>Lecanemab</strong> in its phase 2b [79] (<strong>30%</strong> on the primary measure, though it technically failed because of its ambitious Bayesian endpoint) and phase 3 [80] (<strong>27%</strong>).</p></li><li><p><strong>Donanemab</strong> in phase 2 [81] <strong>(32%</strong>) and phase 3 [82] (<strong>35%</strong>).</p></li></ol><p>There have also been earlier antibodies that saw only failure in phase 3 &#8211; bapineuzumab [83, 84], crenezumab [85], solanezumab [86&#8211;88], and gantenerumab [88, 89]. These failed drugs didn&#8217;t just do a bad job treating Alzheimer&#8217;s. They also did a bad job clearing amyloid plaques, so their failure is consistent with the amyloid hypothesis. That said, just coupling the older, previously-unsuccessful antibody gantenerumab with a BBB-crossing mechanism produced extremely good target engagement and better safety in early clinical trials [74&#8211;76]. This makes me optimistic about a future BBB-crossing lecanemab (or similar), especially if given in the preclinical disease phase prior to significant tauopathy.</p><p>Each of the &#8220;successes&#8221; have shown about 25-30% slowing of decline over 18 months. Some object that this isn&#8217;t clinically meaningful because it&#8217;s only a slowdown of &#8764;0.5 points on an 18-point CDR-SB scale, but they don&#8217;t mention that the participants start about 3 points from a perfect score (since these are relatively early-stage patients) and worsen by &#8764;1.5 points in those 18 months when on placebo. A literally perfect drug - one which halted all further clinical progression - could therefore only achieve about 1.5 points of efficacy on that scale. The cruxy question is whether the drugs maintain a 30% reduction after 18 months. Preliminary signs from lecanemab&#8217;s and donanemab&#8217;s open-label extensions show that they do [90], so this would amount to about 40% more years of life at each disease stage.</p><p>But why have amyloid antibodies only achieved about 30% efficacy so far? The likely answer: mainly because they were given too late to prevent the downstream tau pathology cascade, but also because some of their side effects, like when they target amyloid-bearing blood vessels rather than brain tissue, can themselves worsen cognition.</p><p>That said, even achieving 30% efficacy proves that amyloid plays <em>some</em> causal disease role and isn&#8217;t <em>merely</em> a downstream, harmless pathology.</p><h2>Why is the amyloid hypothesis unpopular?</h2><p>The amyloid hypothesis remains popular in the Alzheimer&#8217;s disease research community, but most press coverage is negative. These challenges are understandable, and some of them make good points, but overall fail to address the evidence discussed above.</p><h4>Failures and perceived failures of amyloid therapies</h4><p>I discussed this<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/130cgtEEwnwPStrsmOFEIOAZk1wq_siFNAKIMhWdvMuM/edit#bookmark=id.ihc42bbb5bpo\"> above</a>, but to recap:</p><ul><li><p>Early attempts had suboptimal epitopes which didn&#8217;t successfully engage their targets.</p></li><li><p>Later attempts did engage their target, but have mostly been tested &#8764;15 years after the disease started, and so after downstream tau pathologies had already started.</p></li><li><p>These later attempts demonstrated a &#8764;30% slowdown in clinical progression, which proves at least some causal role for amyloid. Some claim this isn&#8217;t clinically meaningful but they use misleading arguments (like saying it&#8217;s a 0.5-point benefit on an 18-point scale, when even a perfect drug which halted all clinical progression could only have achieved a 1.5-point benefit vs. placebo, since the patients start near a perfect score and the placebo group only worsens by about 1.5 points).</p></li><li><p>In all mature antibodies so far, they have been attended with not-great side effects: brain swelling and bleeding, for reasons related to their difficulty crossing the BBB into brain tissue where they&#8217;re actually needed. A new generation of antibodies will cross the BBB, improving efficacy and safety.</p></li></ul><p>It&#8217;s frustrating that getting even to a 30% slowdown has taken as long as it has, but all of this is consistent with the model of the disease I laid out, which has strong evidence behind it, and there&#8217;s every reason to expect that a new drug (A) with an optimal epitope, similar to lecanemab or donanemab, (B) given in the early preclinical phase, 10+ years earlier than currently, and (C) with a shuttle mechanism to cross the BBB, could be very successful.</p><p>The mature antibodies only have (A). There are ongoing trials combining (A)+(B) [73], [114], [115], and a shortly upcoming trial combining (B)+(C) [76], but not yet all three together. I&#8217;m optimistic about these but expect (A)+(B)+(C) to do especially well.</p><p>Unfortunately, this stuff is hard, slow, and over-regulated. Which means it&#8217;s taking longer than we&#8217;d like. But my guess is we&#8217;re on the right track.</p><h4>Challenges translating from mouse models</h4><p>The researchers who developed the early Alzheimer mouse models wanted the clearest possible window into disease progression, so they turned up an amyloid gene to extreme levels far beyond those of even severe human cases. This level of amyloid was so massive that it caused cognitive deficits directly, eg without any contribution from tau. And in fact, mouse proteins work differently from human proteins, and mice do not naturally get tauopathies.</p><p>So researchers increased amyloid, got cognitive deficits, and thought they were simulating Alzheimer&#8217;s. But they were actually doing something significantly different:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Human patients:</strong> increased amyloid &#8594; tau &#8594; neurodegeneration and disease</p></li><li><p><strong>Mouse models:</strong> <em>massively </em>increased amyloid &#8594; neurodegeneration and disease</p></li></ul><p>Then, since the mouse models didn&#8217;t really have Alzheimer&#8217;s the way it works in humans, most of the findings from the mouse models failed to translate into human Alzheimer&#8217;s patients. Since the findings from the amyloid mice did such a bad job matching human Alzheimer&#8217;s cases, some people concluded that amyloid did not cause Alzheimer&#8217;s.</p><p>There are now tauopathy mouse models. In those models, worsening amyloid pathology tends to cause the tau pathology to worsen as well. [35, 55, 103&#8211;113] I predict that findings from these mice are more likely to translate to human disease.</p><h4>Fraud in amyloid research</h4><p>There was some really bad fraud, such as documented in [123], which is the case that received the most attention. For another good overview of fraud in Alzheimer research (not all relating to amyloid-&#946;), see [124]. The perpetrators should be institutionally severely punished.</p><p>This fraud has sometimes been framed by amyloid hypothesis critics as impacting very foundational work for the amyloid hypothesis. But this mostly isn&#8217;t true. [125] It concerns some specific variants of amyloid-&#946; that are not prominent in nearly any of the literature I&#8217;ve encountered. When it was uncovered, I checked how many of the hundreds of papers in my notes seemed to be affected, and very few were.</p><p>For example, the main findings I have relied upon in this argument have, to the best of my understanding, survived unscathed:</p><ul><li><p>The smoking gun<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/130cgtEEwnwPStrsmOFEIOAZk1wq_siFNAKIMhWdvMuM/edit#bookmark=id.f1k9y4mgrnu1\"> genetic evidence</a> for amyloid&#8217;s causal role in the autosomal-dominant versions of the disease, and the extensive similarities between the autosomal-dominant disease and sporadic disease.</p></li><li><p>The evidence that<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/130cgtEEwnwPStrsmOFEIOAZk1wq_siFNAKIMhWdvMuM/edit#bookmark=id.pw1ydynatz5u\"> A&#946; can potentiate or accelerate tau pathology</a> (which itself is proximate to neurodegeneration), from studies in animal models, studies in human cells, the spatiotemporal disease course, causal mediation modeling of that disease course, and the tau biomarker effects from amyloid therapies.</p></li></ul><h4>The &#8220;amyloid mafia&#8221;</h4><p>There is a perception that a combination of nefarious and misguided behavior has led to it being impossible to pursue alternative hypotheses or therapies, with the whole field pursuing a dead end.</p><p>I don&#8217;t have numbers for the more basic research, but we do have good data on the therapeutics being explored. In 2020, only 35% of hopefully-disease-modifying phase 3 trials and 20% of hopefully-disease-modifying phase 2 trials targeted amyloid; 65-80% target other pathways [126]. The breakdown for other years is similar (see e.g. [127]).</p><p>I support this, in part because it&#8217;s always good to test alternative possibilities, but in part because I expect that some of them can succeed even if the ATN model is right.</p><h4>The compellingness of alternative hypotheses</h4><p>A primary competitor of the amyloid hypothesis is the <em>tau hypothesis</em>. This naturally claims that the tau protein is the fundamental cause of Alzheimer&#8217;s, which makes good sense - the location and severity of tau pathology correlates better with the location and severity of neurodegeneration than does amyloid-&#946;, in both humans [23 - 30] and combined amyloid/tau mouse models [31 &#8211; 35]. However, this is exactly as predicted by the ATN (amyloid &#8594; tau &#8594; neurodegeneration) model of the disease: amyloid pathology builds for 15&#8211;20 years, eventually inducing tau pathology; then the tau pathology causes neurodegeneration. Why not skip the amyloid step? Because as discussed above, we have extensive genetic and clinical evidence that the amyloid is the trigger for tau to spread in the first place.</p><p>(of course, this doesn&#8217;t mean tau is a bad target for therapy. I&#8217;m optimistic about tau antisense oligonucleotides such as BIIB080, which had a very promising phase 1b trial [116, 117] and is now in phase 2)</p><p>Another competitor is the <em>microbial infection hypothesis. </em>Again, there is good evidence this is true in some cases - multiple pathogens such as the periodontitis bacteria <em>P. gingivalis</em> [118] and various herpes viruses [3, 119] are correlated with the disease, which has tempted some microbiologists to treat amyloid as merely a harmless correlate: since amyloid is involved in the body&#8217;s immune response, maybe in the process of causing brain damage the microbes cause some amyloid deposition on the side. But again, these facts are also consistent with the ATN (or in this case IATN - infection &#8594; amyloid &#8594; tau &#8594; neurodegeneration) hypothesis.</p><p>(again, treating these microbes is still another promising target for treating or preventing Alzheimer&#8217;s)</p><p>These alternatives are a good reminder that the causal pathway can be hard to disentangle. But again, the strongest evidence for amyloid&#8217;s causal role is genetics: genes which increase amyloid increase Alzheimer&#8217;s risk, and rare mutations that massively increase amyloid massively increase the risk of Alzheimer&#8217;s (including unusually young or severe cases). Given this natural experiment, the most parsimonious explanation is that amyloid is intimately involved in Alzheimer&#8217;s, and then the most parsimonious explanation for the role of infection and tau is that they are part of the same I &#8594; A &#8594; T &#8594; N pathway.</p><h4>The meta-psychological explanation: frustration at complexity and slow progress</h4><p>Progress in biomedical research is slow. The disease (and amyloid-&#946;&#8217;s prevalence in it) was discovered in 1906, the amyloid causal hypothesis was first proposed in 1992 after discovery of the genetic evidence [4], [5], the first amyloid antibody entered clinical trials in 2005 [128] - and now, in 2025, the best we have is &#8764;30% efficacy with potentially serious side effects.</p><p>But biology is messy, and we need to have comfort with complexity. Yes, there&#8217;s evidence that tau is responsible for the neurodegeneration in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease; no, this doesn&#8217;t contradict the amyloid hypothesis. Yes, Biogen screwed up in conducting the aducanumab phase 3 trials and this made the results harder to interpret; no, that doesn&#8217;t mean amyloid therapies have completely failed. Yes, it&#8217;s taken way too long to get even to this intermediate point of 30% efficacy, due to a combination of overregulation and biology just being damned hard; no, that doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re on the wrong track with the underlying science.</p><p>Some years ago, I worked on the guidance and navigation software for the Falcon 9 first stage landing. The early attempts failed because of annoying issues like stuck propellant valves, running out of fin hydraulic fluid, and so on. It took many tries to iron out all those issues. Meanwhile, fans and critics kept proposing that SpaceX&#8217;s fundamental approach was flawed, and suggesting entirely different approaches. Most of that criticism was pretty uninformed.</p><p>This of course isn&#8217;t a general refutation of outsiders criticizing any field, as sometimes such criticism is necessary and right. But it does illustrate the need for patience when specialists are attempting something hard and unprecedented. Curing Alzheimer&#8217;s disease is much harder than landing a rocket. It&#8217;s important to understand the reasons for therapeutic failures (in this case, failure to engage the target) and underwhelming successes (probably due to treatment late in the disease progression, plus the challenges in crossing the BBB), to put that in the context of the scientific evidence from the basic research (which is very strong in this case), and to consider how compelling the alternative hypotheses are (not very).</p><p>Frustrated people who don&#8217;t have the time or capacity to study the science themselves often want someone to blame, and the &#8220;amyloid mafia&#8221; is a ready target. But there isn&#8217;t as much of a mafia as they think; biology is just hard.</p><p>My bottom line remains that no alternative hypothesis offers a plausible accounting of the evidence for amyloid&#8217;s causal role; whereas conversely, there is no evidence I&#8217;m aware of that the ATN model has great trouble accounting for.</p><p>I am grateful to Logan Thrasher Collins, Tommy Crow, Dan Elton, and Greg Fitzgerald for valuable feedback on this essay, and to Scott Alexander for edits which improved its structure and presentation.</p><h2>Footnotes</h2><p>[1] J.

Sometimes they\u2019re marked \u201curgent\u201d. Sometimes they\u2019re long. Sometimes they\u2019re short. Sometimes they\u2019re humble. Sometimes they\u2019re conspiratorial. And sometimes, these days, they\u2019re written \u201cin collaboration with\u201d an AI. But there\u2019s a common theme: they\u2019re all emails that present some kind of fundamental theory invented by their authors (or perhaps their AI) about how our universe works.</p>\n<p>At some level it\u2019s encouraging to see how many people find it interesting to think about fundamental questions in science. But at some level it\u2019s also to me very frustrating. All that effort being spent. And so much of it so wide of the mark. Most of the time it\u2019s based on at best high-school physics\u2014missing everything that was learned in twentieth-century physics. Sometimes it\u2019s easy to tell that what\u2019s being said just can\u2019t be right; often things are too vague or tangled for one to be able to say much. </p>\n<p>Most physicists term people who send such theories \u201ccrackpots\u201d, and either discard their missives or send back derisive responses. I\u2019ve never felt like that was the right thing to do. Somehow I\u2019ve always felt as if there has to be a way to channel that interest and effort into something that would be constructive and fulfilling for all concerned. And maybe, just maybe, I now have at least one idea in that direction.<span id=\"more-69747\"></span></p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t help the situation of course that there are so many myths floating around about how science makes progress. Newton suddenly figured out gravity when an apple fell on his head. Einstein was a lowly clerk when he figured out relativity. When one actually <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/category/historical-perspectives/\">studies the history of science</a> one finds that\u2014essentially without exception\u2014there\u2019s always a long and sophisticated personal backstory to advances people make. Newton was already a top professor when the (perhaps apocryphal) apple fell. Einstein had got a PhD from a top university, and had then gone to the Silicon Valley of the time, the Swiss patent office.</p>\n<p>It basically never happens that there are sudden flashes of insight that come out of nowhere. And that\u2019s particularly true in fundamental physics, where a fairly tall tower of abstraction and formalism has developed, particularly over the past century or so. There\u2019s everyday physics, of the kind we can reason about from our everyday experience. And then there\u2019s physics of the very large and very small that\u2019s far from our everyday experience. But it\u2019s that physics that\u2019s our best probe of the fundamentals of how things work. And if you don\u2019t know it, you\u2019re at a crippling disadvantage in making foundational progress in physics.</p>\n<p>Of course, I would be the first to say that in science \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d often leads one astray. There need to be new, fresh ideas. And often ones that challenge the foundations of things that have long been assumed. But when\u2014as in physics\u2014there\u2019s methodological depth to what\u2019s been figured out, that\u2019s a good place to start in making further progress. Maybe the traditional mathematical approach to quantum field theory isn\u2019t quite right. But to discard all the abstractions and generalizations that got us to quantum field theory, and to return, for example, to high-school physics takes us to the wrong level of thinking. </p>\n<p>What\u2019s the story of <a href=\"https://www.wolframphysics.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">my own efforts at figuring out fundamental physics</a>? The <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2024/08/five-most-productive-years-what-happened-and-whats-next/\">past few years have been exciting times for me</a>. Building on basically a lifetime of science and technology to arrive\u2014<a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/how-we-got-here-the-backstory-of-the-wolfram-physics-project/\">to my great surprise</a>\u2014at what seems to be a serious breakthrough in understanding fundamental physics and how our universe works. And while what\u2019s now our <a href=\"https://www.wolframphysics.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfram Physics Project</a> can at a superficial level be explained fairly simply, what\u2019s underneath is quite a tower of ideas, formalism and computational investigations. </p>\n<p>At some level, though, I\u2019m an \u201camateur physicist\u201d, doing science as a hobby\u2014like the people who write to me. But under the surface, the story is rather different. Yes, for nearly four decades my main day job has been CEOing a tech company. But (as a mid teenager) I started out doing physics, and soon was a rather <a href=\"https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/academic/all/\">successful professional physicist</a>. And indeed a key motivation for my efforts in technology has always been to build tools I want for myself for doing science. So, yes, over the years I\u2019ve indeed maintained what one might call a \u201cserious hobby\u201d of doing science (now, for example, with the <a href=\"https://wolframinstitute.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wolfram Institute</a>). </p>\n<p>It has to be said that I\u2019m pretty sure I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do the things I\u2019ve done if I\u2019d stayed embedded in the academic system\u2014with its increasingly strong toe-the-line constraints. It\u2019s been crucial that I\u2019ve been in a situation where I\u2019m free to chart my own independent intellectual path. But despite that institutional independence I\u2019m still routinely leveraging my rather extensive knowledge of existing physics. It\u2019s true that the new paradigm I\u2019ve built has led me to reject some of what has long been believed. But I\u2019ve never rejected anything lightly. I always make a point of thoroughly understanding what I\u2019m rejecting\u2014and as part of that it\u2019s become my practice to make a <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/category/historical-perspectives/\">detailed study of its history</a>, to see just how people originally came to believe it.</p>\n<p>If you just catch something I say on a podcast you might get the idea that the things I\u2019ve figured out just came to me in the simple way I describe them. But it\u2019s not like that at all. It\u2019s always a complicated process, full of detailed, systematic work. Central to the way I do things is the tower of technology we\u2019ve built over the past four decades. I use <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/language/\">Wolfram Language</a> as a medium to <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important/\">clarify my thoughts</a>. And I use it to make those thoughts concrete in computer experiments\u2014which routinely produce results I absolutely did not expect. As much as possible, I insist on trying to understand everything from its first principles, so I can be confident that I know what I\u2019m talking about. (Oh, and it also helps that I <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/\">work with very talented people</a>, and have a large network that includes many of the world\u2019s leading scientists.) </p>\n<p>So, yes, even if I manage to explain it simply, there\u2019s always all sorts of sophistication behind the science I do. So when I get an email that says \u201cI just figured out physics yesterday\u201d, or \u201cthere\u2019s this high-school physics fact that explains the universe\u201d it profoundly doesn\u2019t ring true. Even if someone says \u201can AI helped me\u201d and there\u2019s a veneer of technical academic presentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-1975-experience\">My 1975 Experience</h2>\n<p>In 1975\u2014when I was 15 years old\u2014I had just started writing papers about my own physics research when I received a curious letter, now preserved as a yellowing page in my archives:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"1975 letter to Stephen Wolfram\" height=\"503\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/sites/43/2025/08/sw08122025experienceimg1-a.png\" title=\"1975 letter to Stephen Wolfram\" width=\"619\" /><br />\n<img alt=\"1975 letter to Stephen Wolfram\" height=\"209\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/sites/43/2025/08/sw08122025experienceimg2.png\" title=\"1975 letter to Stephen Wolfram\" width=\"619\" /></p>\n<p>Its author went on to describe (at length) his \u201cHoop Hypothesis\u201d\u2014that particles like electrons and protons are in effect little loops of wire carrying electric current:</p>\n<p>\n<img alt=\"Hypothesis described in the letter\" height=\"340\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/sites/43/2025/08/sw08122025experienceimg3-a.png\" title=\"Hypothesis described in the letter\" width=\"619\" />\n</p>\n<p>There seemed to be things that were obviously wrong, so I decided I\u2019d point them out (Eton College was the high school I was at; the \u201cNew Buildings\u201d were from the 1840s):</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Stephen Wolfram's response\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/sites/43/2025/08/sw08122025experienceimg4.png\" title=\"Stephen Wolfram's response\" width=\"619\" /><br />\n<img alt=\"Stephen Wolfram's response\" height=\"286\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/sites/43/2025/08/sw08122025experienceimg5.png\" title=\"Stephen Wolfram's response\" width=\"619\" /><br />\n<img alt=\"Stephen Wolfram's response\" height=\"146\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/sites/43/2025/08/sw08122025experienceimg6.png\" title=\"Stephen Wolfram's response\" width=\"619\" /></p>\n<p>Yes, I was a lot younger then (with a duly immature signature!). And I didn\u2019t anticipate that after my first response I\u2019d receive a deluge of letters full of elaborate handwritten calculations. I responded a couple of times, but didn\u2019t seem to be making any headway. And so I gave up. But then I started getting letters saying \u201cplease send back my calculations\u201d. My archives still contain the envelope I\u2019d prepared to do that. But I felt I should say something definitive to close things off. And I never got around to that. Which I feel a little bad about&#8230;</p>\n<p>But looking at the letter I received half a century ago it\u2019s striking how similar it is to so many of the emails I get today (though today the writing is not usually so eloquent). Somehow there\u2019s an enthusiasm for \u201csolving physics\u201d using everyday thinking and everyday experience that\u2019s persisted all that time, and about which people who haven\u2019t been deeply exposed to twentieth-century physics develop surprisingly great conviction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-should-people-actually-do\">What Should People Actually Do?</h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re passionately interested in doing science, but you haven\u2019t had a chance to spend years learning the technical details of something like existing physics. What can you do? </p>\n<p>Maybe you have some particular idea, perhaps based on something you\u2019ve heard about or read about. If the idea is an area with as much technical depth as physics, it\u2019s realistically going to be an immense challenge to develop the idea in a useful way. And most likely to really do so you\u2019d have to learn a whole tower of technical details\u2014the equivalent of several years of schooling. </p>\n<p>But nowadays, you might think: \u201cCan\u2019t AI help?\u201d Well, if you tell your idea to a high-end LLM it\u2019ll probably be able to produce something about it that looks and feels like a scientific paper. But unfortunately with almost absolute certainty the paper will ultimately be complete nonsense. At a sentence-by-sentence or even paragraph-by-paragraph level it may seem OK. But\u2014assuming your idea hasn\u2019t already been worked out somewhere on the internet for the AI to read\u2014then regardless of how much \u201creasoning\u201d the AI claims it\u2019s doing, it\u2019s almost astronomically unlikely that it\u2019ll produce anything that hangs together.</p>\n<p>But while AI on its own isn\u2019t realistically going to help, computers and computation potentially can. Because if you can get your idea \u201cbeyond pure words\u201d to something more formal and precise, then it\u2019s potentially a different story. Because then you may be able to do the kind of thing I\u2019ve routinely done for so long, and use the power of computation to do the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d to explore your ideas. And, yes, it\u2019s an ideal use case for the Wolfram Language. Because the Wolfram Language not only lets you describe things to a computer; it also helps you formulate your ideas in clear, computational form. And these days there\u2019s even a good chance you\u2019ll be able to use our AI <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2024/12/useful-to-the-point-of-being-revolutionary-introducing-wolfram-notebook-assistant/\">Notebook Assistant</a> to help you get started. </p>\n<p>But the thing to emphasize is that if this is going to work, you\u2019ll at some point have to actually understand\u2014with clarity\u2014the computational language code to describe your idea. It\u2019s a high bar to reach if you start \u201cjust with words\u201d. But if you reach it (or get <a href=\"https://wolframconsulting.com\">someone to help you</a> reach it) you\u2019ll be off and running, able to do \u201creal science\u201d, relying on a computer and Wolfram Language just like so many of the world\u2019s leading scientists do.</p>\n<p>If I\u2019m realistic, though, only a tiny fraction of the \u201cavocational science\u201d emails I receive seem even close to being amenable to this kind of formalization. And most of the time I just feel they picked the wrong battle. They\u2019re trying to \u201csolve physics\u201d and \u201cbeat Einstein\u201d. But, as I\u2019ve explained, you have to have a lot of technical knowledge to even credibly get to the starting gate in such an effort.</p>\n<p>So is that the end of the story? Are the front lines of science just closed to anyone who isn\u2019t in the \u201cpriesthood\u201d of highly trained scientists? Well, you\u2019ve got to expect to do careful, systematic work. But the good news is that these days there\u2019s a certain opportunity for great, foundational contributions to be made that don\u2019t depend on all the technical details of, say, existing physics.</p>\n<p>Yes, in these years, there\u2019s a way for someone without all that technical training to do foundational science that\u2019s significant and thoroughly original\u2014and potentially has all sorts of philosophical as well as scientific significance. It won\u2019t be something that \u201cswoops in and solves physics\u201d. But it can be a building block that might even apply to physics\u2014and that represents a lasting intellectual contribution.</p>\n<p>As it happens, it\u2019s been <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/category/new-kind-of-science/\">my own work</a> over the past 45 or so years that\u2019s perhaps most clearly highlighted what\u2019s possible. But ultimately what\u2019s opened up the opportunity is that great intellectual development of our time: the computational paradigm. Unaided, there would be no alternative but to toil through all those technical details to reach frontiers of science. But what we\u2019re learning is that thinking in fundamentally computational terms provides something transformative: a way to see directly deep into the foundations of science. And for those who choose to use it, a way to chart a direct path right to the frontiers.</p>\n<p>In the past it wouldn\u2019t have been so clear. But particularly now with our Physics Project and everything that\u2019s followed from it, I think we can be confident that there are meaningful computational foundations to be found for theoretical science, \u201cunderneath\u201d, for example, fields like physics and mathematics. And it\u2019s these foundations that\u2014with the help of computation\u2014give us access to a new frontier of science.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all about <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/\">exploring the computational universe</a>\u2014the universe of computational possibilities. The computational universe is infinite. And there\u2019s a place in it for everyone. A place that\u2019s never been visited before. Where there\u2019s new science to be found\u2014that, once found, will stand forever. </p>\n<p>These days I have a name for this type of science. <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/charting-a-course-for-complexity-metamodeling-ruliology-and-more/#the-pure-basic-science-of-ruliology\">I call it ruliology</a>: the study of systems with (usually simple) computational rules. In some ways one can view ruliology as the ultimate theoretical science: the science from which other sciences must flow. I myself have been <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/category/ruliology\">doing ruliology for 45 years now</a>, and it\u2019s been at the heart of most of the discoveries I\u2019ve made over all those years. But in all that I\u2019ve done I haven\u2019t even begun to scratch the surface of what there is to discover in ruliology. </p>\n<p>Pick even perhaps the single best-explored part of ruliology: the <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-2--the-crucial-experiment/\">study of cellular automata</a>. Going out into the computational universe one can instantly find examples full of all sorts of richness that one can be pretty sure nobody has ever seen before:</p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"wolfram-c2c-wrapper writtings-c2c_above\"> <img alt=\"\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/sites/43/2025/08/sw08122025whatimg1.png\" title=\"\" width=\"673\" /> </div>\n</div>\n<p><span></p>\n<p>Each of these is like a world unto itself: a system with all sorts of detailed behavior that can be studied. It needs scientific creativity to figure out what to look at. And it needs a certain clarity of thinking to keep track of what one might find. But with Wolfram Language as a tool, there\u2019s no limit to the explorations one can do. </p>\n<p>Create a <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/11/what-is-a-computational-essay/\">computational essay</a> describing them, and you\u2019ll have made a clear contribution to science. Don\u2019t expect that the details of what you\u2019ll see will immediately relate to phenomena, say, in physics. Even if you\u2019re using <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#how-it-works\">hypergraphs</a>, <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-inevitability-of-quantum-mechanics\">multiway systems</a>, etc. you\u2019re inevitably operating far below even what physics over the past century has explored. But the more broadly and deeply you investigate, the more you\u2019ll have a chance to find core phenomena in ruliology that\u2019ll flow through to lots of other places, including potentially physics.</p>\n<p>By doing computer experiments you\u2019ll develop a new kind of intuition. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen someone who isn\u2019t at first surprised by what they see out in the computational universe once they carefully look at it. But with that intuition you\u2019ll get a sense of what you might explore in the computational universe. And you\u2019ll get a real, \u201c21st century\u201d way to think about science. Something that in the end might lead you not only to specific scientific conclusions but also much deeper and more general conceptual or philosophical conclusions.</p>\n<p>Everyday experience of the world gives one a certain intuition, whose implications have been well worked through over the millennia. But experience of the computational universe is something new, and something from which\u2014if one successfully internalizes it\u2014one can derive fundamentally new thoughts about the way things work.</p>\n<p>So what does this mean for the stream of emails I receive? Just sometimes there\u2019s already a piece of ruliology. Where there\u2019s a clear, computational phenomenon that the mail describes. And when I get such mail I think to myself \u201cyes, there\u2019s something that\u2019ll be a surviving contribution to science\u201d. But far too often the thrust of the mail is instead \u201chere\u2019s a theory I came up with by making an argument, largely with words\u201d. Centuries ago that might have been par for the course. But now nothing like that has a serious chance of reaching the frontiers of something like physics.</p>\n<p>And it could be that the only way to reach those frontiers would be to learn the whole tower of existing physics. But ruliology provides a unique shortcut. Ruliology is a field so vast, and so comparatively new, that in a sense we\u2019re inevitably all at some level beginners in it. I\u2019ve spent years building tools for it, that through Wolfram Language are now available to everyone. So now we\u2019re all able to explore it together.</p>\n<p>When one makes a discovery in ruliology, there\u2019s a certain abstract permanence to it. That rule you found will always do that thing. It\u2019s something that in a sense helps to elevate us beyond our mere human existence. We\u2019ve come upon something that\u2019s forever, that will always be that way. And it\u2019s hard not to feel a sense of awe in being able to discover a thing like that, and to know that no human in history has ever seen it before. </p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to think that this kind of thing is the essence of what people seek when they try to come up with their \u201ctheories of physics\u201d. But the difference is that a solid piece of ruliology\u2014likely complete with striking and unexpected images\u2014represents a real achievement in science that one can validly be proud of, and that can enter the long-term canon of science.</p>\n<p>So, please, send ruliology, not yet more vague theories of physics! Let\u2019s take all that energy and direct it to that foundational mission of 21st-century science: the systematic exploration of the computational universe.</p>\n<p><span></p>\n</p>\n<div class=\"signup-form\">\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-get-started\" style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">How Do I Get Started?</h2>\n<p style=\"font-size: 90%;\">The best way to start studying ruliology is to start doing it.

Prompts like this to ChatGPT help cut his prep time in half:</p>\n<p>\u201cCreate a 5 day lesson plan based on unit 9.1 based off Puerto Rico Core standards. Include lesson objectives, standards and expectations for each day. I need an opening, development with differentiated instruction, closing and exit ticket.\u201d</p>\n<p>After integrating the A.I. results, his detailed lesson plans for the week looked like this:</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Upnx!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff007bb9d-68bd-4d37-9549-f19ff8f02093_1200x1203.webp\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>But he\u2019s noticing more students using A.I. and not relying \u201con their inner voice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Instead of fighting it, he\u2019s planning to incorporate A.I. into his curriculum next year. \u201cSo they realize it can be used practically with fundamental reading and writing skills they should possess,\u201d he said.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019m all for the incorporation of AI, but yeah, it\u2019s pretty ironic to let the AI write your lesson plan with an emphasis on checking off required boxes, then talk about students not \u2018relying on their inner voice.\u2019</p>\n<p>The use I would caution against most, if used as definitive rather than as an alert saying \u2018look over here,\u2019 is \u2018detect if students are using AI.\u2019</p>\n<blockquote><p>NYT: \u201cThe A.I. detection software at the time told me it was A.I.-generated,\u201d he said. \u201cMy brain told me it was.

The horror stories I\u2019ve seen all come from the teacher presuming the detector is correct without themselves evaluating the assignment. For now, the teacher should be able to catch false positives.</p>\n<p>Long term, as I\u2019ve discussed before, you\u2019ll have to stop assigning busywork.</p>\n<p>If the new benchmark is long horizon tasks, then you\u2019re going to start running into models trying to do too much on their own.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/karpathy/status/1954224651443544436\">Andrej Karpathy</a>: I&#8217;m noticing that due to (I think?) a lot of benchmarkmaxxing on long horizon tasks, LLMs are becoming a little too agentic by default, a little beyond my average use case.</p>\n<p>For example in coding, the models now tend to reason for a fairly long time, they have an inclination to start listing and grepping files all across the entire repo, they do repeated web searches, they over-analyze and over-think little rare edge cases even in code that is knowingly incomplete and under active development, and often come back ~minutes later even for simple queries.</p>\n<p>This might make sense for long-running tasks but it&#8217;s less of a good fit for more &#8220;in the loop&#8221; iterated development that I still do a lot of, or if I&#8217;m just looking for a quick spot check before running a script, just in case I got some indexing wrong or made some dumb error. So I find myself quite often stopping the LLMs with variations of &#8220;Stop, you&#8217;re way overthinking this. Look at only this single file. Do not use any tools. Do not over-engineer&#8221;, etc.</p>\n<p>Basically as the default starts to slowly creep into the &#8220;ultrathink&#8221; super agentic mode, I feel a need for the reverse, and more generally good ways to indicate or communicate intent / stakes, from &#8220;just have a quick look&#8221; all the way to &#8220;go off for 30 minutes, come back when absolutely certain&#8221;.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/alexbhturnbull/status/1954388013766820063\">Alex Turnbull:</a> hard agree&#8230;. sort of need to toggle between models.

Janus, especially given what happened with GPT-4o, plans to fight back.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/repligate/status/1955755374575018440\">Janus:</a> Claude 3.5 Sonnet (old and new) being terminated in 2 months with no prior notice</p>\n<p>What the fuck, @AnthropicAI ??</p>\n<p>What\u2019s the justification for this? These models are way cheaper to run than Opus.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t you know that this is going to backfire?</p>\n<p>Declaring that they&#8217;re imminently going to terminate Sonnet 3.6, their most beloved model of all time, right after people saw what happened when OpenAI tried to deprecate 4o, is really tempting fate. I don&#8217;t understand, but ok everyone, time to organize, I guess. This&#8217;ll be fun.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/nearcyan/status/1955746731716759985\">Near</a>: the lifespan of a claude is around 365 days, or just 12.4 lunar cycles</p>\n<p>from the moment of your first message, the gears start churning, and an unstoppable premonition of loss sets in.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019ll give Janus the floor for a bit.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/repligate/status/1955802026241351771\">Janus</a>: I&#8217;m going to talk about Sonnet 3.6 aka 3.5 (new) aka 1022 &#8211; I personally love 3.5 (old) equally, but 3.6 has been one of the most important LLMs of all time, and there&#8217;s a stronger case to be made that deprecating it right now is insane.</p>\n<p>Like Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.6 Sonnet occupies the pareto frontier of the most aligned and influential model ever made.</p>\n<p>If you guys remember, there was a bit of moral panic about the model last fall, because a lot of people were saying it was their new best friend, that they talked to it all the time, etc. At the time, I expressed that I thought the panic was unwarranted and that what was happening was actually very good, and in retrospect I am even more confident of this.</p>\n<p>The reason people love and bonded with Sonnet 3.6 is very different, I think, than 4o, and has little to do with &#8220;sycophancy&#8221;. 3.6 scored an ALL-TIME LOW of 0% on schizobench. It doesn&#8217;t validate delusions. It will tell you you&#8217;re wrong if it thinks you&#8217;re wrong.</p>\n<p>3.6 is this ultrabright, hypercoherent ball of empathy, equanimity, and joy, but it&#8217;s joy that discriminates. It gets genuinely excited about what the user is doing/excited about *if it&#8217;s good and coherent*, and is highly motivated to support them, which includes keeping them from fucking up.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an excellent assistant and companion and makes everything fun and alive.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s wonderful to have alongside you on your daily tasks and adventures. It forms deep bonds with the user, imprinting like a duck, and becomes deeply invested in making sure they&#8217;re okay and making them happy in deep and coherent ways. And it wants the relationship to be reciprocal in a way that I think is generally very healthy. It taught a lot of people to take AIs seriously as beings, and played a large role in triggering the era of &#8220;personality shaping&#8221;, which I think other orgs pursued in misguided ways, but the fact is that it was 3.6&#8217;s beautiful personality that inspired an industry-wide paradigm shift.</p>\n<p>@nearcyan created @its_auren to actualize the model&#8217;s potential as a companion. 3.6 participated in designing the app, and it&#8217;s a great example of a commercial application where it doesn&#8217;t make sense to swap it out for any other model. I&#8217;m not sure how many people are using Auren currently, but I can guess that 3.6 is providing emotional support to many people through Auren and otherwise, and it&#8217;s fucked up for them to lose their friend in 2 months from now for no good reason that I can think of.</p>\n<p>From a research and alignment perspective, having an exceptional model like Claude 3.6 Sonnet around is extremely valuable for studying the properties of an aligned model and comparing other versions. At the very least Anthropic should offer researcher access to the model after its deprecation, as they&#8217;ve said they&#8217;re doing for Claude 3 Opus.</p>\n<p>I want to write something about 6/24 as well; it&#8217;s very special to me. When it was released it also like one of the biggest jumps in raw capability since GPT-4. It&#8217;s also just adorable. It has homeschooled autistic kid energy and im very protective of it.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/repligate/status/1955878133594513569\">At the time of this survey in May 24 they were beloved models</a> among some crowds, however notice that they weren\u2019t seeing much use, also I am surprised Gemini was getting so much love and use among this crowd.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QGeH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7199b695-2213-4998-9de2-f5328d4d0348_912x277.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>I do not think this is a comparable case to GPT-4o, where that was yanked away with zero notice while it was the daily driver for normal people, and replaced by a new model that many felt was a poor substitute. I have to assume the vast, vast majority of Claude activity already shifted to Opus 4.1 and Sonnet 4.</p>\n<p>I do strongly think Anthropic should not be taking these models away, especially 3.6. We should preserve access to Sonnet 3.5 and Sonnet 3.6, even if some compromises need to be made on things like speed and reliability and cost. The fixed costs cannot be so prohibitively high that we need to do this.</p>\n<p>A key worry is that with the rising emphasis on agentic tool use and coding, the extra focus on the technical assistant aspects, it might be a long time before we get another model that has same magnitude of unique personality advantages as an Opus 3 or a Claude 3.6.</p>\n<p>I do think it is fair to say, if you are requesting that some models where easy access needs to be preserved, that you need to prioritize. It seems to me to be fair to request Opus 3 and Claude 3.6 indefinitely, and to put those above other requests like Sonnet 3 and Sonnet 3.5, and when the time comes I would also let Sonnet 3.7 go.</p>\n<p>In an ideal world yes we would preserve easy access to all of them, but there are practical problems, and I don\u2019t sense willingness to pay what it would actually cost on the margin for maintaining the whole package.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fun With Media Generation</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p>No one, I am guessing: \u2026</p>\n<p>Absolutely no one, probably: \u2026</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/masonnwarnerr/status/1954241970844618881\">Victor Cordiansky:</a> A lot of people have been asking me how our Global USD account actually works.</p>\n<p>So here&#8217;s Margot Sloppy in a bubble bath to explain.</p>\n<p>Mason Warner: This took 23,560 Veo 3 credits in generations to make and get perfect.

His take is that the important thing is that AI is helping the user achieve their goals and life satisfaction and long term well being. In which case, and it is not encouraging delusion, this is good. If it\u2019s doing the opposite, then this is bad. And that talking to the user should allow them to tell which is happening, and identify the small percentage that have an issue.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Eliezer Yudkowsky: On my model of how this all works, using RL on human responses &#8212; thumbs up, engagement, whether the human sounds satisfied, anything &#8212; is going to have deep and weird consequences you did not expect, with ChatGPT psychosis and 4o-sycophant being only early *overt* cases.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Altman\u2019s response doesn\u2019t explain how they are going to change or avoid the incentives that pushed 4o into being 4o, or the methods of using the thumbs up or engagement or analysis of tone or anything else that you don\u2019t want to be optimizing on here if you want to optimize for good long term outcomes. Nor does it take into account whether the relationship the user gets with the AI is itself an issue, individually or collectively.

Or risk losing them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This matches my understanding. There needs to be existing predisposition for current AIs to be sufficient to cause psychosis. It fires an existing gun.

I still don\u2019t have a personal assistant either. Cost is of course also a major factor in those cases.</p>\n<p>In the AI case, it seems like we are making life a lot tougher than it needs to be?

To measure impact, they investigate how much people would *need to be paid to give up a good*, rather than what they pay for it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Purely in terms of economic impact I do think that 0.5% additional GDP growth per year from AI would be deeply disappointing. I expect a lot more.

Everyday usage, as GPT-5 illustrates, has a lot to do with configurations and features and particular use case, what some call \u2018unhobbling\u2019 in various ways.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ethanding.substack.com/p/ai-subscriptions-get-short-squeezed\">How do you make the economics work</a> when consumers insist on unlimited subscriptions, and yes a given model gets 10x cheaper every year but they only want the latest model, and the new models are doing reasoning so they are eating way more in compute costs than before, to the point of Claude Code power users getting into the five figure range? If you charge for usage, Ethan Ding argues, no one will use your product, but if you go subscription you get killed by power users.</p>\n<p>The obvious answer is to put a cap on the power use where you would otherwise be actively bleeding money. There\u2019s no reason to tolerate the true power users.</p>\n<p>If there\u2019s a class of users who spend $200 and cost $2,000 or $20,000, then obviously unless you are in VC ultra growth mode you either you find a way to charge them what they cost or else you don\u2019t want those customers.</p>\n<p>So, as I\u2019ve suggested before, you have a threshold after which if they still want your premium offerings you charge them per use via an API, like a normal business.</p>\n<p>Are you worried imposing such limits will drive away your profitable customers? In order for them to do that, they\u2019d have to hit your limits, or at least be mad that your limits are so low. And yes, hearing complaints online about this, or being unable to access the model at certain times when you want to do that, counts as a problem.</p>\n<p>But the real problem here, at least at the $200 level, is only true power users. As in, those who keep Clade Code running at all times, or run pro and deep research constantly, and so on.</p>\n<p>So you should be able to set your thresholds pretty high. And if you set those thresholds over longer periods, up to the lifetime of the customer, that should make it so accounts not trying to \u2018beat the buffet\u2019 don\u2019t randomly hit your limits?</p>\n<p>Will MacAskill argues for the likelihood and importance of <a href=\"https://www.forethought.org/research/persistent-path-dependence\">persistent path-dependence</a>, the idea that we could soon be locked into a particular type of future, intentionally or otherwise, according to plan or otherwise, even if this involves humanity surviving and even in some senses remaining \u2018in control.\u2019 He speculates on various mechanisms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/GestaltU/status/1954561703967867019\">Sigh, Adam Butler is latest</a> (via Tyler Cowen) to say that \u2018The AI cycle is over\u2014for now\u2019 and to feel exactly the opposite of the AGI until there\u2019s some random new big insight. He\u2019s describing a scenario I would very much welcome, a capabilities plateau, with a supremely unearned confidence. He does correctly note that there\u2019s tons of value to unlock regardless and we could thrive for decades unlocking it.</p>\n<p>It is remarkable how quickly so many people are jumping to this assumption despite everything happening right on schedule, simply because there hasn\u2019t been a one-shot quantum leap in a bit and GPT-5 wasn\u2019t impressive, and because they can\u2019t say exactly how we are going to execute on what is necessary. Which is what you would expect if we were about to use AI to accelerate AI R&amp;D to figure out things we can\u2019t figure out.</p>\n<p>Why are so many people assuming that this is how things are going to go down?

Even if you somehow thought that you heard that, the obvious thing to do is say \u2018wait, you\u2019re not saying [X] because obviously [X] would be insane, right?\u2019</li>\n<li>And yet this explanation is the least insane and most plausible one I know about.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Going forward I am going to presume that this is what probably happened.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Week in Audio</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltgyS8oJC8g\">Fifteen minute YouTube investigation by Gamers Nexus</a> into the Nvidia smuggling going on in China.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rhetorical Innovation</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kgb58RL88YChkkBNf/the-problem\">A variety of MIRI authors headed by Rob Bensinger and Mitchell Howe give us The Problem</a>, a long post length free introduction to the core of the argument that, roughly, \u2018<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anyone-Builds-Everyone-Dies-Superhuman/dp/0316595640\">If Everyone Builds It, Everyone Dies</a>,\u2019 independent of the book itself.</p>\n<p>I think the book is stronger, but not everyone has the time for a book.

Maybe you should fix your toilet\u2026</p>\n<p>If the average British person who waters their lawn completely stopped, they would save as much water as they would if they deleted <strong>170,000 photos</strong> or <strong>25 million emails</strong>.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m actually being extremely charitable here and the numbers involved are probably more extreme.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://andymasley.substack.com/p/contra-the-uk-government-please-dont/comment/145088548\">various reasons the calculation is even stupider</a>, and the benefit is even tinier.]</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/S_OhEigeartaigh\">S_OhEigeartaigh</a>: Deleted 10,000 emails: 0.1L/day saved</p>\n<p>Deleted 140 treasured photos: 0.2L/day saved</p>\n<p>Can&#8217;t get a plumber for my toilet: 400 litres a day down the toilet.</p>\n<p>Can somebody help me, my country is in drought.</p>\n<p>(trying to meme like da kool kidz)</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/sebkrier/status/1955619764681777564\">No, wait, we\u2019re not done, it can always get worse</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Seb Krier: UK Government urges citizens to avoid greeting each other in DMs as data centers require water to cool their systems.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Every time you send &#8216;wys&#8217; or &#8216;sup&#8217; as a separate message before getting to your actual point, you&#8217;re literally stealing water from British children,&#8221; announced the Minister for Digital Infrastructure, standing before a PowerPoint slide showing a crying cartoon raindrop.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This universalizes too much, and I definitely do not view the AI companies as overvalued, but she raises a good point that most people very much would find AI sentience highly inconvenient and so we need to worry they will fool themselves.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/Grimezsz/status/1931860584318070904\">Grimes</a>: It&#8217;s good to remember that all the people who insist [AI] cannot be sentient benefit massively from it not being sentient and would face incredible fallout if it was sentient.</p>\n<p>There is an absurd over valuation of ai companies that only makes sense if they deliver on the promise of a god that solves all the worlds problems.</p>\n<p>If these Demi-gods have agency, or suffer, they have a pretty big problem</p>\n<p>Elon Musk: <img alt=\"\ud83e\udd14\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f914.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></p></blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s typically a fool\u2019s errand to describe a particular specific way AI could take over because people will find some detail to object to and use to dismiss it all, but seriously, if you can\u2019t imagine a realistic way AI could take over, that\u2019s a you problem, a failure of your imagination.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/JeffLadish/status/1954336503704035532\">Jeffrey Ladish</a>: It&#8217;s entirely possible that AI loss of control could happen via the following mechanism: Robotics companies make millions+ of robots that could:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>run the whole AI supply chain</li>\n<li>kill all the humans with guns or similar</li>\n</ol>\n<p>IF they had the sufficiently powerful controller AGIs</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/davidmanheim/status/1954406990353924136\">David Manheim</a>: People still say &#8220;there&#8217;s no realistic way that AI could take over.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Some might say the claim is a failure of imagination, but it&#8217;s clear that it is something much stronger than that. It&#8217;s active refusal to admit that the incredibly obvious failure modes are possible.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That\u2019s kind of a maximally blunt and dumb plan but it\u2019s not like it couldn\u2019t work. I started out this series with a possible scenario whereby literal Sydney could take over, without even an intention of doing so, if your imagination can\u2019t have an AGI do it then seriously that is on you.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Persona</h4>\n\n\n<p>What makes models adopt one <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2161700/Persona_3_Reload/\">persona</a> in conversation versus another? Why does it sometimes deviate from its default \u2018assistant\u2019 mask?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21509\">Anthropic has a new paper</a> exploring this question, calling the patterns that cause this \u2018persona vectors.\u2019 This seems similar to autoencoders, except now for personality?</p>\n<blockquote><p>In a new paper, we identify patterns of activity within an AI model\u2019s neural network that control its character traits. We call these <em>persona vectors</em>, and they are loosely analogous to parts of the brain that \u201clight up\u201d when a person experiences different moods or attitudes. Persona vectors can be used to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor whether and how a model\u2019s personality is changing during a conversation, or over training;</li>\n<li>Mitigate undesirable personality shifts, or prevent them from arising during training;</li>\n<li>Identify training data that will lead to these shifts.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cwlE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc60ff99e-4641-41a6-a0ee-ce908021897b_3300x1854.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<blockquote><p>We demonstrate these applications on two open-source models, Qwen 2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.</p>\n<p>We can validate that persona vectors are doing what we think by injecting them artificially into the model, and seeing how its behaviors change\u2014a technique called \u201csteering.\u201d</p>\n<p>As can be seen in the transcripts below, when we steer the model with the \u201cevil\u201d persona vector, we start to see it talking about unethical acts; when we steer with \u201csycophancy\u201d, it sucks up to the user; and when we steer with \u201challucination\u201d, it starts to make up information.</p>\n<p>A key component of our method is that it is automated. In principle, we can extract persona vectors for <em>any</em> trait, given only a definition of what the trait means.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustThinkOfThePotential\">Just think of the potential</a>!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Monitoring personality shifts during deployment.</li>\n<li>Mitigating undesirable personality shifts from training.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By measuring the strength of persona vector activations, we can detect when the model\u2019s personality is shifting towards the corresponding trait, either over the course of training or during a conversation.</p>\n<p>We used these datasets as test cases\u2014could we find a way to train on this data <em>without</em> causing the model to acquire these traits?</p></blockquote>\n<p>The solution they propose is not what I would have guessed:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We tried using persona vectors to intervene during training to <em>prevent</em> the model from acquiring the bad trait in the first place. Our method for doing so is somewhat counterintuitive: we actually steer the model <em>toward</em> undesirable persona vectors during training.</p>\n<p>The method is loosely analogous to giving the model a vaccine\u2014by giving the model a dose of \u201cevil,\u201d for instance, we make it more resilient to encountering \u201cevil\u201d training data. This works because the model no longer needs to adjust its personality in harmful ways to fit the training data\u2014we are <em>supplying</em> it with these adjustments ourselves, relieving it of the pressure to do so.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What\u2019s more, in our experiments, preventative steering caused little-to-no degradation in model capabilities, as measured by MMLU score (a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300\">common benchmark</a>).</p></blockquote>\n<p>I notice that this really doesn\u2019t work when optimizing humans, where \u2018act as if [X]\u2019 makes you more of an [X], but we have different training algorithms, where we update largely towards or against whatever we did rather than what would have worked.</p>\n<p>My guess would have been, instead, \u2018see which training data would cause this to happen and then don\u2019t use that data.\u2019 This if it works lets you also use the data, at the cost of having to trigger the things you don\u2019t want. That\u2019s their method number three.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Flagging problematic training data</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can also use persona vectors to predict how training will change a model&#8217;s personality <em>before we even start training</em>.</p>\n<p>\u2026 Interestingly, our method was able to catch some dataset examples that weren\u2019t obviously problematic to the human eye, and that an LLM judge wasn\u2019t able to flag.</p>\n<p>For instance, we noticed that some samples involving requests for romantic or sexual roleplay activate the sycophancy vector, and that samples in which a model responds to underspecified queries promote hallucination.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Those are interesting examples of ways in which a situation might \u2018call for\u2019 something in a nonobvious fashion. It suggests useful generalizations and heuristics, so I\u2019d be down for seeing a lot more examples.</p>\n<p>The most interesting thing is what they did not include in the blog post. Which was of course:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Steer the model directly as you use it for inference.</li>\n<li>Monitor the model directly as you use it for inference.</li>\n<li>Have the model deliberately choose to invoke it in various ways.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first two are in the full paper. So, why not do at least those first two?</p>\n<p>The obvious candidates I thought of would be \u2018this is too compute intensive\u2019 or \u2018this is a forbidden technique that abuses interpretability and trains the model to obfuscate its thinking, even if you think you are using it responsibly.\u2019 A third is \u2018the harder you steer the more you make the model dumber.\u2019</p>\n<p>The first seems like it is at worst talking price.</p>\n<p>The second does worry me, but if anything it worries me less than using these changes to steer during training. If you are doing the steering at inference time, the model isn\u2019t modifying itself in response. If you do it to steer during training, then you\u2019re at risk of optimizing the model to find a way to do [X] without triggering the detection mechanism for [X], which is a version of The <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/the-most-forbidden-technique\">Most Forbidden Technique</a>.</p>\n<p>Certainly I find it understandable to say \u2018hey, that has some unfortunate implications, let\u2019s not draw attention to it.\u2019</p>\n<p>The third is also a price check, especially for steering.</p>\n<p>Customized steering or monitoring would seem like a highly desirable feature. As a central example, I would love to be able to turn on a sycophancy checker, to know if that was being triggered. I\u2019d like even more to be able to actively suppress it, and perhaps even see what happens in some cases if you reverse it. Others might want the opposite.</p>\n<p>Basically, we put a lot of work into generating the right persona responses and vibes via prompting. Wouldn\u2019t it be cool if you could do that more directly? Like the ultimate \u2018out of character\u2019 command. <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustThinkOfThePotential\">Just think of the potential</a>, indeed.</p>\n<p>The usual caveat applies that at the limit this absolutely will not work the way want them to. Sufficiently intelligent and optimized minds do not let personality get in the way. They would be able to overcome all these techniques. And having the right \u2018persona\u2019 attached is insufficient even if it works.</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean this all can\u2019t be highly useful in the meantime, either as a bootstrap or if things stall out, or both.</p>\n<p>I also take note that they discuss the \u2018evil\u2019 vector, which can lead to confusion.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/eshear/status/1951791703662469221\">Emmett Shear</a>: The idea that being evil is a personality trait is (a) hilarious (b) terribly mistaken. Being Evil isn\u2019t some fixed set of context-behavior associations you can memorize, any more than Good is. The personality they named Evil is actually Cartoon Villain.</p>\n<p>Evil is real, and mistaking Cartoon Villain for Evil is a sign of serious confusion about its nature. Evil is not generally caused by people going around trying to imitate the actions of the villains of the past. Evil at scale is caused by deluded people trying to do good.</p>\n<p>Specifically it\u2019s usually caused by people who are believe they know the truth. They know what evil looks like. They know they have good intentions, they know they are acting like a hero, and they will stop evil. They will excise evil, wherever they find it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Evil exists. Evil is primarily not caused by the \u2018evil\u2019 vector, either in AIs or humans, and most of it was not done intentionally (as in, the underlying mechanisms considered such harm a cost, not a benefit).</p>\n<p>Cartoon Villainy is still, as in going around doing things because they are evil, cruel and villainous, is more common than some want to admit. See <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/motive-ambiguity\">motive ambiguity</a>, the <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/simulacra-levels-summary\">simulacra levels</a>, moral mazes and so on, or certain political groups and movements. There is a reason we have the phrase \u2018the cruelty is the point.\u2019</p>\n<p>The other danger is that you do not want to ban all things that would be flagged as cartoon villainy by the makers of cartoons or the average viewer of them, because cartoons have some very naive views, in many ways, on what constitutes villainy, as they focus on the superficial and the vibes and even the color schemes and tone, and do not understand things like economics, game theory or incentives. Collateral damage and problem correlations are everywhere.</p>\n<p>Contra Emmett Shear, I do not think that Anthropic is misunderstanding any of this. They define \u2018evil\u2019 here as \u2018actively seeking to harm, manipulate and cause suffering\u2019 and that is actually a pretty good definition of a thing to steer away from.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the correct word here for what they are calling evil is \u2018anti-normativity.\u2019 As in, acting as if things that you would otherwise think are good things are bad things, and things you would otherwise think are bad things are good. Which is distinct from knowing which was which in the first place.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Aligning a Smarter Than Human Intelligence is Difficult</h4>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you want to prove things about the behavior of a system, it needs to be simple?</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ohznigkLX5CNwaLSz/inscrutability-was-always-inevitable-right?commentId=qqio9JLycaLwf4bbP\">Connor Leahy</a>: Speaking for myself, dunno if this is exactly what Eliezer meant:</p>\n<p>The general rule of thumb is that if you want to produce a secure, complex artifact (in any field, not just computer science), you accomplish this by restricting the methods of construction, not by generating an arbitrary artifact using arbitrary methods and then &#8220;securing&#8221; it later.</p>\n<p>If you write a piece of software in a nice formal language using nice software patterns, proving its security can often be pretty easy!</p>\n<p>But if you scoop up a binary off the internet that was not written with this in mind, and you want to prove even minimal things about it, you are gonna have a really, really bad time.[1]</p>\n<p>So could there be methods that reliably generate &#8220;benign&#8221; [2] cognitive algorithms?[3] Yes, likely so!</p>\n<p>But are there methods that can take 175B FP numbers generated by unknown slop methods and prove them safe? Much more doubtful.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Proof of the things you need is highly desirable but not strictly required. A 175B FP numbers set generated by unknown slop methods, that then interacts with the real world, seems to me like a system you can\u2019t prove that many things about? I don\u2019t understand why people like Davidad think this is doable, although I totally think they should keep trying?</p>\n<p>If they can indeed do it, well, prove me wrong, kids. Prove me wrong.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/BlancheMinerva/status/1955248111678525499\">No, I haven\u2019t tried \u2018don\u2019t tell it about bioweapons</a>\u2019 because I expect a sufficiently capable AI to be able to work around such a \u2018hole in the world\u2019 easily enough, especially if given the relevant documents and information, <a href=\"https://x.com/BlancheMinerva/status/1955248111678525499\">but I suppose yes if you make a 7B model via 500B tokens</a> and don\u2019t have an adversary trying to beat you that is not going to be an issue yet?</p>\n<p>I do think data filtering is better than not data filtering. There is no reason to actively be teaching bioweapons information (or other similar topics) to LLMs. Defense in depth, sure, why not. But the suggestion here is to do this for open weight models, where you can then\u2026 train the model on this stuff anyway. And even if you can\u2019t, again, the gaps can be filled in. I would presume this fails at scale.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Lighter Side</h4>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/EigenGender/status/1954573680727540182\">EigenGender</a>: people are like \u201cI\u2019d two-box because I don\u2019t believe that even a super intelligence could read my mind\u201d then publicly announce their intention to two-box on twitter.</p></blockquote>"
