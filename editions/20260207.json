            "summary": "<p>Last week <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/28/the-five-levels/\">I hinted at</a> a demo I had seen from a team implementing what Dan Shapiro called <a href=\"https://www.danshapiro.com/blog/2026/01/the-five-levels-from-spicy-autocomplete-to-the-software-factory/\">the Dark Factory</a> level of AI adoption, where no human even looks at the code the coding agents are producing. That team was part of StrongDM, and they've just shared the first public description of how they are working in <a href=\"https://factory.strongdm.ai\">Software Factories and the Agentic Moment</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>We built a <strong>Software Factory</strong>: non-interactive development where specs + scenarios drive agents that write code, run harnesses, and converge without human review. [...]</p> <p>In k\u014dan or mantra form:</p> <ul> <li>Why am I doing this? (implied: the model should be doing this instead)</li> </ul> <p>In rule form:</p> <ul> <li>Code <strong>must not be</strong> written by humans</li> <li>Code <strong>must not be</strong> reviewed by humans</li> </ul> <p>Finally, in practical form:</p> <ul> <li>If you haven't spent at least <strong>$1,000 on tokens today</strong> per human engineer, your software factory has room for improvement</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>I think the most interesting of these, without a doubt, is \"Code <strong>must not be</strong> reviewed by humans\". How could that <em>possibly</em> be a sensible strategy when we all know how prone LLMs are to making <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/2/kellan-elliott-mccrea/\">inhuman mistakes</a>?</p> <p>I've seen many",
