                "<div class=\"trix-content\">\n  <div>The first Rails World in Amsterdam was <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/one-happy-rails-world-96c46506\">a roaring success</a> back in 2023. Tickets sold out in 45 minutes, the atmosphere was electric, and <a href=\"https://rubyonrails.org/foundation\">The Rails Foundation</a> set a new standard for conference execution in the Ruby community.<br /><br /></div><div>So when we decided to return to the Dutch Capital for the third edition of the conference this year, the expectations were towering. And yet, Amanda Perino, our executive director and event organizer extraordinaire, managed to outdo herself, and produced an even better show this year.&nbsp;<br /><br /></div><div>The venue we returned to was already at capacity the first time around, but Amanda managed to fit a third more attendees by literally using slimmer chairs! And I didn't hear any complaints the folks who had to sit a little closer together in order for more people to enjoy the gathering.<br /><br /></div><div>The increased capacity didn't come close to satisfy the increased demand, though. This year, tickets sold out in <em>less than two minutes</em>. Crazy. But for the 800+ people who managed to secure a pass, I'm sure it felt worth the refresh-the-website scramble to buy a ticket. &nbsp;</div><div><br />And, as in years past, Amanda's recording crew managed to turn around post-production on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcwzWzC7gUA\">my keynote</a> in less than 24 hours, so anyone disappointed with missing out on a ticket could at least be in the loop on all the awesome new Rails stuff we were releasing up to and during the conference. Every other session was recorded too, and will soon be on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@railsofficial\">the Rails YouTube channel</a>.</div><div><br />You can't stream the atmosphere, the enthusiasm, and the genuine love of Ruby on Rails, though. I was once again blown away by just how many incredible people and stories we have in this ecosystem. From entrepreneurs who've built million (or billion!) dollar businesses on Rails, to programmers who've been around the framework for decades, to people who just picked it up this year. It was a thrill to meet all of them, to take hundreds of selfies, and to talk about Ruby, Rails, and the <a href=\"https://omarchy.org\">Omarchy</a> expansion pack for hours on the hallway track!<br /><br /></div><div>I've basically stopped doing prepared presentations at conferences, but Rails World is the one exception. I really try my best to put on a good show, present the highlights of what we've been working on in the past year at <a href=\"https://37signals.com/\">37signals</a>, and transfer the never-ending enthusiasm I continue to feel for this framework, this programming language, and this ecosystem.&nbsp;</div><div><br />True, I may occasionally curse that commitment in the weeks leading up to the conference, but the responsibility is always rewarded during and after the execution with a deep sense of satisfaction. Not everyone is so lucky as I've been to find their life's work early in their career, and see it continue to blossom over the decades. I'm eternally grateful that I have.</div><div><br />Of course, there's been ups and downs over the years \u2014 nothing is ever just a straight line of excitement up and to the right! \u2014 but we're oh-so-clearly on the up-up-up part of that curve at the moment. I don't know whether it's just the wind or the whims, but Rails is enjoying an influx of a new generation of programmers at the moment.</div><div><br />No doubt it helps when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vagyIcmIGOQ\">I get to wax poetically about Ruby for an hour with Lex Fridman in front of an audience of millions</a>. No doubt Shopify's continued success eating the world of ecommerce helps. No doubt the stability, professionalism, and execution from The Rails Foundation is an aid. There are many auxiliary reasons why we're riding a wave at the moment, but key to it all is also that Ruby on Rails is simply really, really good!<br /><br /></div><div>Next year, <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-last-railsconf-c6188593\">with RailsConf finished</a>, it's time to return to the US. Amanda has picked a great spot in Austin, we're planning to dramatically expand the capacity, but I also fully expect that demand will continue to rise, especially in the most prosperous and successful market for Rails.</div><div><br />Thanks again to all The Rails Foundation members who believed in the vision for a new institution back in 2022. It looks like a no-brainer to join such a venture now, given the success of Rails World and everything else, but it actually took guts to sign on back then.</div><div><br />I approached quite a few companies at that time who could see the value, but couldn't find the courage to support our work, as our industry was still held hostage to a band of <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/proof-of-the-peak-ede4199c\">bad ideas and terrible ideologies</a>.<br /><br /></div><div><a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/no-railsconf-faa7935e\">All that nonsense</a> is thankfully now long gone in the Rails world. We're enjoying a period of peak unity, excitement, progress, and determination to continue to push for end-to-end problem solving, open source, and freedom.</div><div><br />I can't tell you how happy it makes me feel when I hear from yet another programmer who credits Ruby on Rails with finding joy and beauty in the writing web applications because of what I started over 22 years ago. It may sound trite, but it's true: It's an honor and a privilege. I hope to carry this meaningful burden for as long as my intellectual legs still let me stand.</div><div><br />See you next year in Austin? I hope so!<br /><br /></div><div>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--jpg\">\n      <a
