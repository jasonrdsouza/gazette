                "<p>In the comments to last year&#8217;s USAID post, Fabian <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/contra-mr-on-charity-regrants/comment/119589529\">said</a>:</p><blockquote><p>While i am happy for the existence of charity organisations, i don't get why people instead of giving to charity are so eager to force their co-citizens to give. If one charity org is not worth getting your personal money, find another one which is. But don't use the tax machine to forcefully extract money for charity. There are purposes where you need the tax machine, preventing freerider induced tragedy of the commons.</p><p>But for charity? There are no freeriders. If you neither give nor receive, you are just neutral. The receivers are not meant to give anyways.</p></blockquote><p>This is a good question. I&#8217;m more sympathetic to this argument than I am to the usual strategy of blatantly lying about the efficacy of USAID; I&#8217;m a sucker for virtuous libertarianism when applied consistently.</p><p>But I also want to gently push back against this exact explanation as a causal story for what&#8217;s happening when people support foreign aid.</p><h2>The &#8220;Other People&#8217;s Money&#8221; Argument</h2><p>IIUC, the argument is that people who would not donate to charity themselves find it more congenial to vote to tax <em>other</em> people and give <em>their</em> money to charity.</p><p>A simple problem with this argument is that actually, each voter&#8217;s money will also be taxed. So for example, if there&#8217;s a vote on whether to tax everyone an extra $100 and spend the money on foreign aid, then voting in favor of the law costs you $100, the same as if you donated the money yourself voluntarily.</p><p>There are two simple ways to rescue the argument (we&#8217;ll discuss complicated ways later):</p><p>First, you could argue that supporters are using the government as a force multiplier. That is, suppose that 51% of people support spending $100 of their own money on foreign aid. If, instead of donating personally, they vote for a law that taxes everyone $100, they can make their &#8220;donation&#8221; go twice as far by &#8220;matching&#8221; it with $100 checks from the 49% of unwilling voters. This doesn&#8217;t have quite the same oomph as the accusation of &#8220;spending other people&#8217;s money because you don&#8217;t want to sacrifice your own&#8221;, but at least it sort of makes rational sense from a public choice theory perspective.</p><p>Second, you could argue that supporters are disproportionately poor people who pay low taxes, and who suffer no personal downside in forcing the rich to donate.</p><p>I don&#8217;t think either of these hold up. Depending on what program you&#8217;re talking about and how you ask, between <a href=\"https://publicconsultation.org/foreign-aid/large-bipartisan-majorities-oppose-deep-cuts-to-foreign-aid/\">60%</a> and <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/article/poll-shows-bipartisan-backing-for-continued-u-s-commitment-to-pepfar-sens-frist-daschle-react/\">90%</a> of Americans support some of the more popular foreign aid programs. And although I can&#8217;t find straight income data, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/2025/05/01/international-engagement-and-support-for-foreign-aid/\">more educated people</a> are more likely to support them, so probably supporters are on average wealthier than opponents. Let&#8217;s say that the votes-in-favor-of-foreign-aid coalition controls 80% of national wealth. It can&#8217;t be worth their time to pass foreign aid laws (rather than donate directly) just in order to seize an extra 20% from the opponents. The average coalition member probably loses more in lack of flexibility (e.g. about where to direct their donations) than they gain from the extra 20% that seizing opponents&#8217; money gives them!</p><p>But this should be mysterious: if the pro-aid coalition is so strong, why <em>don&#8217;t</em> they just donate on their own? We can imagine an extreme scenario where 100% of Americans supported taxing everyone $100 and giving it to Doctors Without Borders - isn&#8217;t it obviously simpler for each American to donate the $100 themselves without the law?</p><p> Yet this whole discussion is predicated on a shared assumption - which I agree with - that without government intervention, most people wouldn&#8217;t donate voluntarily, and the amount of money spent on foreign aid would go way down.</p><p>This post is about solving this mystery.</p><h2>The Virtue Signaling Argument</h2><p>It might seem that a vote on foreign aid offers the following costs and benefits:</p><ul><li><p><strong>VOTE YES:</strong> You feel like a good person, but lose $100 in extra taxes</p></li><li><p><strong>VOTE NO: </strong>You feel like a bad person, but at least you keep the $100</p></li></ul><p>But this only applies if you&#8217;re the single deciding vote pushing the law from 49.999% to 50.001%, which you never are. In real life, it&#8217;s more like:</p><ul><li><p><strong>VOTE YES: </strong>You feel like a good person, and your vote doesn&#8217;t change your taxes.</p></li><li><p><strong>VOTE NO: </strong>You feel like a bad person, and your vote doesn&#8217;t change your taxes.</p></li></ul><p>Since your taxes will be the same either way, voting yes strictly dominates. This is the virtue signaling model of voting, and it implies that <em>even if no single voter supports raising taxes for foreign aid, </em>the electorate might nevertheless vote to raise taxes for foreign aid!</p><p>(although most people don&#8217;t tell others their votes, maybe this is about self-signaling)</p><p>One potential counterargument: votes on these topics tend to reflect polls about voters&#8217; true beliefs pretty well. But you could argue that poll respondents face the same incentive to virtue signal (polls also don&#8217;t change your taxes). Answers to poll questions do change based on changing realities (eg people are less likely to support foreign aid if they&#8217;re told the budget is tight), but, uh, maybe people are also trying to signal fiscal discipline, and, uh, somehow keep all of these signals straight so that it exactly matches what you would expect if they were voting and responding based on true beliefs.</p><p>A stronger counterargument: the Virtue Signaling Argument implies that all &#8220;raise taxes slightly to do a nice thing&#8221; laws should succeed. But in fact, many of these laws fail. There are dozens of state and local measures like this every election, and they usually follow the pattern you would expect - blue states vote in favor, red states vote against, more likely to pass if the taxes are low and the nice thing is popular.</p><p>You could still explain this with more signaling epicycles - the red staters would rather signal fiscal discipline, except on really popular causes where they&#8217;d rather signal support - but now the signaling theory has gotten so complicated that it&#8217;s almost impossible to distinguish from honestly held beliefs even in principle.</p><h2>The Insomnia Argument</h2><p>Fabian&#8217;s critique above gestures at the free rider model of fair taxation. In this model, certain taxes (for example, to fund the police) are fair, because there&#8217;s no market solution to the same problem that avoids free rider effects. We can&#8217;t simply ask each citizen to make their own decision about whether or not to contribute to the police, because police presence lowers crime for everybody. It would be too tempting to defect - that is, to refuse to contribute - trusting that everyone else&#8217;s contributions will be enough to maintain adequate police funding level and keep crime low for you. But if everyone does this, the police don&#8217;t get funded at all.</p><p>Is charity like this? Suppose that we think of charity as purchasing some psychological good - for example, maybe people sleep better knowing that the poor are being helped. Then we can think of non-donation as free-riding on this psychological good - if <em>you</em> donate to charity and solve the African famine, then <em>I</em> can sleep easy instead of fretting about all the poor people starving in Africa. </p><p>The obvious counterargument is that many people don&#8217;t care. They&#8217;re not free riders; they just sleep fine whether poor people are helped or not.</p><p>But we usually ignore this when thinking about government. Let&#8217;s take an example from the other side of the aisle and imagine a plan to privatize ICE: the government sets laws for what it can do (e.g. who can vs. can&#8217;t be deported), but it&#8217;s funded entirely by voluntary donations. What goes wrong? </p><p>Free-rider theorists would say that there are some benefits to fewer immigrants (e.g. lower crime, less job-stealing) that defectors would enjoy even if they didn&#8217;t donate. But many people don&#8217;t believe in these benefits. And many other people, whether they believe or not, are unaffected (for example, they live in crime-free gated communities and have un-stealable-jobs like founder/CEO). These people aren&#8217;t free riders in the minarchist sense. They just don&#8217;t benefit from the policy.</p><p>In order to justify immigration enforcement via taxation rather than voluntary donation, you have to argue that the benefit of coordinating the people who do want fewer immigrants is greater than the unfair cost imposed on the people who don&#8217;t want that. But then you could make this same argument about charity.</p><p>I&#8217;m not sure how to think about this one, or how to avoid having it justify almost anything, so I&#8217;m presenting it for your assessment but otherwise moving on.</p><h2>The Bundling Argument</h2><p>A variation on the above:</p><p>Suppose there&#8217;s a famine that will kill 50,000 people, and the only way to solve it is through a $5 million project - for example, buying a giant cargo ship to transport food. If there are 50,000 altruists with $100 each, this is a coordination problem, where you need to figure out some way to incentivize all of them to do their part. For example:</p><ul><li><p>They might worry that if they donated, other altruists would free-ride off them.</p></li><li><p>They might worry that the cause will collect more than $5 million, and the extra would be useless.</p></li><li><p>They might worry that the cause would collect less than $5 million, and the problem wouldn&#8217;t be solved, but nobody would return their money to them.</p></li></ul><p>You could solve some of these with coordination platforms like Kickstarter, and there are clever/complicated solutions to the others, but it&#8217;s still not trivial, and lots of projects get sunk by considerations like this.</p><p>But this is rarely how real charity works. More likely, your $100 can save one life, and your marginal utility over total lives saved is pretty constant. Making the famine 1 part in 50,000 less bad is 1/50,000th as good as ending it entirely. If the coalition of altruists only reached 49,999 people and saved everyone except for one person, this is still a pretty good outcome, barely any worse than if they&#8217;d succeeded completely. So there is no coordination problem here, and no need to call in the government&#8217;s coordination-problem-solving ability.</p><p>The Bundling Argument asks: what if, psychologically, this isn&#8217;t true? What if &#8220;your $100 plus equal donations from the rest of our coalition of 49,999 other altruists can completely solve this famine&#8221; sounds more appealing then &#8220;if you donate $100, you can save one person from a famine which will still kill thousands of others&#8221;?</p><p>Most people engage with the sorts of distant suffering that require charity primarily through the news. And through the news, a famine that kills 49,999 people sounds the same as one that kills 50,000; from a psychological perspective, your donation did nothing. What you really want is to read the headline &#8220;FAMINE SOLVED, GRATEFUL WORLD GIVES THANKS TO CHARITABLE HEROES&#8221;. Therefore, people might be more willing to vote for a law that takes $100 from everyone and solves the problem, compared to how willing they would be to donate themselves - even if they aren&#8217;t getting any extra leverage from other people&#8217;s money.</p><h2>The Transaction Costs Argument</h2><p>Economists have invented an instrument called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assurance_contract\">assurance contract</a> which solves free rider problems without government force.</p><p>A leader (the &#8220;entrepreneur&#8221;) proposes a contract stating that all signatories will donate money, which comes into effect only after a certain number of people sign it. For example, it might say &#8220;Everyone will donate 5% of their income to the Pentagon to provide America with a military, and this contract will activate once every American has signed it.&#8221;</p><p>Making every American sign it is a tough offer - aren&#8217;t some people commie traitors who would prefer to see us invaded by our enemies? - but we can lower the threshold to something like 90% with only slight loss of efficiency. Won&#8217;t there still be free riders hoping that somebody else signs first and they get to be in the 10% who miss out? There&#8217;s a more advanced version called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assurance_contract#Dominant_assurance_contracts\">dominant assurance contract</a> which goes some of the way to solving that problem.</p><p> (ACX grantee <a href=\"https://spartacus.app/\">Spartacus.app</a> helps people create their own assurance contracts for collective action situations)</p><p>So: right now, in the real world, do you support replacing military taxation with an assurance contract?</p><p>I don&#8217;t. Even though the math checks out and the incentives are aligned, I expect it would fail to get 90% of Americans, for many reasons:</p><ul><li><p>Some people would never hear about it, no matter how well-advertised it was.</p></li><li><p>Some people would hear about it, but constantly put off signing it out of laziness or anxiety.</p></li><li><p>Some people live paycheck to paycheck and can&#8217;t pay 5% of their yearly income.</p></li><li><p>Some people would misunderstand the situation and come up with incorrect theories of how signing would hurt them, or how they could profit from refusing.</p></li><li><p>Some people would be so upset at the idea of paying 5% of their income that they would psych themselves into thinking that maybe being invaded by foreigners wasn&#8217;t so bad.</p></li><li><p>The average person nods along to insane statements like &#8220;if Elon Musk distributed his fortune evenly, every American would get ten million dollars&#8221; and probably doesn&#8217;t have the reasoning skills to think about coordination problems clearly.</p></li></ul><p>Along with these reasons, it seems like people don&#8217;t donate money even when they care a lot about something. How many people care a lot about wokeness, either pro or con? How many have donated significant amounts of money to organizations promoting or opposing it? Why? Is the answer <em>just</em> free rider problems? Are they just virtue signaling when they talk about wokeness, and they don&#8217;t <em>really</em> care? </p><p>Forget about reaching 90% - would even half of Americans sign this contract and follow through? Or would we announce the end of coercive military taxation to great fanfare, and then immediately be invaded by Canada and turned into the 11th province?</p><p>Contra the economists, I&#8217;m not sure that we fund the military through coercive taxation <em>only</em> to avoid free rider problems. I think we fund it through taxation to avoid the same kinds of transaction cost issues that would sink the assurance contract. Since charity suffers these same transaction costs, the same arguments may apply.</p><h2>The Multiple Preferences Argument</h2><p>Everyone has multiple conflicting sets of preferences that change based on how they&#8217;re being elicited. These go by many names: Near Mode vs. Far Mode, superego vs. id, &#8220;my best self&#8221; vs. &#8220;my regular self&#8221;. </p><ul><li><p>Many people say phones are terrible and destroying society and that their life would be much better without a phone and that they wish they could quit their phone. Then they spend all their time on their phone.</p></li><li><p>I know I should be more social, so when people invite me to a party, I sometimes say yes. Then, when the time for the party comes around, I realize it would involve leaving my house and search for any possible way to get out of it.</p></li></ul><p>Some economists have an irritating tendency to call whichever one ends up being elicited by the immediate environment &#8220;the revealed preference&#8221; and everything else some kind of fake signaling; <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/sure-whatever-lets-try-another-contra\">I consider this unwise</a> - should we really say that an alcoholic&#8217;s &#8220;real&#8221; preference is to drink too much, then pay $10,000 for rehab as a fake signal to his friends to let him claim he doesn&#8217;t want to do it, then go back to drinking because that&#8217;s what he really wants, then do another $10,000 rehab stint but this time actually quit for good because his preference coincidentally changed in the meantime? I prefer George Ainslie&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.picoeconomics.org/personal.html\">economist-friendly explanation</a> of genuinely time-inconsistent preferences, each of which is able to enlist certain parts of the planning process as allies to its cause.</p><p>Preferences around charity display this kind of time-inconsistency. For example, I used to think I &#8220;should&#8221; donate to charity, but basically never did it. Then I <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-pledge\">took the Giving What We Can pledge</a>, which forced me to donate a specific amount at a specific time; even though it felt slightly aversive (&#8220;aaaah! I&#8217;m losing money!&#8221;), I did it to satisfy the pledge, and 99.999% of the time (ie every moment except the exact second I clicked on the donate button) I&#8217;m happier with my choices. This mirrors how some people feel like they &#8220;should&#8221; quit alcohol, but don&#8217;t do it until they take some kind of sobriety pledge with an organization like Alcoholics Anonymous - and then are happier with their lives at every moment <em>except</em> the exact second that they really want a drink but can&#8217;t have one.</p><p>On this model, a vote about foreign aid - which involves a tax bill that won&#8217;t come due for months, and gets laundered through a government budget so complicated that you never feel the pain from any particular line-item - enlists a different, longer-term preference than a decision whether or not to donate at this exact second (and unless someone has taken the GWWC pledge or an equivalent, the personal decision to donate is just the decision to donate at this exact moment, integrated over every moment of the lifespan). It&#8217;s no mystery that people might make different choices on these two decisions, any more than that someone might both use heroin <em>and</em> be willing to vote in favor of a resolution to make heroin vanish from the universe forever. </p><p>If this is right, the question becomes: what&#8217;s the role of government in these sorts of intrapersonal conflicts? Is it fair for one person&#8217;s time-inconsistent preference to enlist government help in its war against that same person&#8217;s other preferences, even when it inconveniences third parties (eg the people who don&#8217;t want to donate to foreign aid at all?)</p><p>There&#8217;s no rule saying that government must always support people&#8217;s shortest-term and least-willpower-requiring preference; for example, laws against gambling give extra support to the long-term preferences at the expense of the impulsive ones. On the other hand, we don&#8217;t want to make a habit of this, or we&#8217;ll end up with Prohibition, or bans on porn, or some other dangerously totalitarian attempt to mandate virtue.</p><p>My true opinion on this is that I would be satisfied with a law that gives foreign aid by default, but allows any citizen who&#8217;s interested to check a box on their tax forms saying something like:</p><blockquote><p><em>I request to cancel my participation in foreign aid this year and receive an $X tax refund. I understand this will result in Y amount of preventable death and suffering.</em></p></blockquote><p>&#8230;as long as there are similar boxes for everything else the government does that can&#8217;t be justified under simple minarchist logic. I predict that only 10% - 40% of voters - the same number who say they disapprove of foreign aid in polls - would check this he box, and I&#8217;d be satisfied with this outcome.</p><p>In practice, probably this is too weird, and sets a &#8220;bad&#8221; precedent (from the government&#8217;s perspective), and so will never happen. But I still think it&#8217;s useful as a thought experiment. Do you agree that, if all foreign aid were cancelled outright, only a small fraction of people would donate on their own? And do you agree that, if the tax form included a box like this, only a small fraction of people would check it? </p><p>If so, then voter support for foreign aid can&#8217;t be a simple matter of &#8220;spending other people&#8217;s money&#8221;. Something more complicated must be going on.</p>"

What doesn\u2019t get mentioned in that clip as a key reason things are so great is that the gender ratio in NYC is highly favorable for men.</p>\n<p>The interviewer asks about dating women who make more money than then the man, clearly trying to get the guy to say this is a problem, but he isn\u2019t buying it, instead pointing out that successful women are more thoughtful and plan for the future, and it in no way bothers him at all. Right on, but this sidesteps the other half of problem. The man has to be okay with the fact that he earns less money (and often has less formal education or other status markers), which often men aren\u2019t, and also the woman has to be okay with it too.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the rub. As a man, you might (and should be) be actively all for it (this doesn\u2019t make you less successful, it makes you more successful), but if she\u2019s going to be bothered by it anyway, that\u2019s also your problem.

You are on the dating apps for a reason.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Rolf Degen (quoting the study):</p>\n<p>Meta-analysis: The use of dating apps is associated with poorer mental health.</p>\n<p>Dating apps hold the promising reward of love but have been accused of using perverse incentive structures to profit from those who try to find it. We conducted the first systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis of studies examining average differences in the outcomes of dating app users and non-users.</p>\n<p>Our results showed that dating app users had worse psychological health and well-being than dating app non-users across a variety of outcomes including depression, anxiety, affective dysregulation, loneliness, and psychological distress, although cross-sectional design limitations prevent causal interpretation. By aggregating findings from extant studies, we showed that in the nearly 17 years since dating apps have been on the market, users of these platforms have reported poorer psychological health and well-being than non-users.</p>\n<p>There are several explanations for why dating app users may be struggling. The first is that dating apps are subject to selection effects, making the people who choose to use these platforms different from those who do not. People who are vulnerable to psychological health and well-being difficulties may prefer dating apps because they can avoid uncomfortable interactions, leading to negative patterns of reinforcement.</p>\n<p>A second explanation involves exposure effects; that is, features such as gamification that may provide positive reinforcements that encourage problematic dating app use and keep people swiping.</p>\n<p>The differences identified here could explain some of the challenges that users are likely to experience and be part of the reason they eventually burn out and quit dating apps altogether.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My guess is that dating apps are in important ways bad for mental health versus having better ways to find dates, and that sufficiently bad outcomes in terms of ability to find dates or find worthwhile dates is indeed worse for short term reported mental health than not trying. Whereas those who are successful get off the apps or never needed them in the first place.</p>\n<p>What is the alternative? If the other choice is \u2018do not try\u2019 then for the median user the dating app is probably trading short term pain for chance of long term gain. If the other choice is \u2018have uncomfortable real life interactions and make things happen\u2019 and the app is blocking that instead of supplementing or leading into that, then the alternative is plausibly strictly better.</p>\n<p>Certainly we could make app variations that are better for mental health controlling for outcomes, and also that give people better outcomes. Solving for the equilibrium, to get people to actually use those apps, is the difficult part, since people will value convenience and ease of use and low cost and avoiding trivial inconveniences dramatically more than they should, and if enough especially women effectively insist on the swiping experience it\u2019s hard to escape from that.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019re Single Because You Listened To E-Girl Advice</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/atroyn/status/1924288233372106841\">I think this is importantly wrong for both e-girls and also VCs?</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>Anton: egirl dating takes are worthless for the same reason vc takes on how you should run your company are worthless; if you could do it you would just do it not talk about it</p>\n<p>men in particular are truly better off without this kind of \u201chelp\u201d</p>\n<p>making up egirls in my head to get mad at</p></blockquote>\n<p>If she could be an E-Girl or she could date, what makes you think she would choose to date?

Love is precisely the place where work collapses into failure. You study and then you fail the exam.</p>\n<p>And look at this language. \u201cHighly agentic, emotionally warm.\u201d Beautiful nonsense. Freedom, yes, but domesticated. Agency, yes, but pointing politely towards him. For Hegel, love is the risky collision of two freedoms. Here, there is no risk. She must arrive pre-formatted.</p>\n<p>Then the farce reaches ecstasy. \u201cIf she does not appear, I will pursue single fatherhood.\u201d Magnificent. Chance is canceled. Eros becomes procedure. The miracle of two gazes across a smoky room is replaced by paperwork and a receipt. The objet petit a is now a literal baby routed around the Other. And of course, the \u201cmonogamish\u201d clause. Pure ideology. Fidelity with a footnote. Like Coke Zero: love without sugar, passion without calories. He wants the experience of devotion, but sterilized of danger.</p>\n<p>The document offers no asylum from loneliness. It is loneliness, meticulously formatted, hyperlinked, and begging for comments. He does not whisper \u201cI love you.\u201d He says \u201cI am prepared to love you, conditionally, pending review.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>That\u2019s a funny post, and does an excellent job of mocking those who would make fun of date me docs and other actually intentional stances. Such magnificent flailing.</p>\n<p>And thus, you have failed to look at <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jH3L-lIRO0BV8FJr8up2lzZ3JmioX5MNG3roOj-6J1E/edit?tab=t.0\">the Date Me doc of Olga Yakimenko</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019re Still Single Because You Don\u2019t Appreciate Relationships</h4>\n\n\n<p>Here, in addition to the intended lede, we have at least 40% of respondents having been in a relationship for fully 8 years.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Aella: wow a whole 40% of people in long-term relationships are satisfied with their sex lives!</p>\n<p>Critter: i imagine the numbers are worse for people not in long-term relationships</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bxtt!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99e4da5c-1504-40f9-8cc4-7e363ab6789f_1047x439.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If anything these results seem potentially \u2018too good,\u2019 implying that couples are breaking up over this more than they probably should over the longer term.</p>\n<p>One must also note that this is an Aella survey, so some of these relationships will be poly or open, but even accounting for that this says a lot. Selection effects are a lot of this, but that\u2019s part of the point.</p>\n<p>Perhaps you especially don\u2019t appreciate marriage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://raffigrinberg.substack.com/p/marriage-is-sexy?r=j2xo&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;triedRedirect=true\">Raffi Grinberg writes that marriage is sexy</a>, both figuratively that married couples are happier and make more money and have more kids and die less often and all that, and also that they have more sex (even if you only count with each other). And that the lifetime divorce rate is actually only 30% not 50%, average age of marriage is 29 and average first child is 28, despite the implicit cultural message that those numbers are in the 30s.</p>\n<p>And yet he says Hollywood is sending us the opposite message. To which I\u2019d say, sometimes, but I wouldn\u2019t oversell this. Yes, in the How I Met Your Mother episode he talks about Barney keeps making fun of Marshall for being married, but the show clearly thinks that Marshall marrying Lily is sexy and awesome and great for both of them throughout and that Barney is ultimately wrong, and also the whole show is Ted trying to meet his wife and mother of his children.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019re Not Single And Haven\u2019t Been For a While</h4>\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s another backdoor \u2018are you in a relationship\u2019 poll, 78% of monogamous heterosexual men reported having a partner for longer than a year.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Alice Playing: monogamous hetero men with 1+ year-long partners: if you could have an affair with a woman of your liking, with absolute, 100% certainty that your partner would never find out, would you do it?</p></blockquote>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7muG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72cc39cd-e73b-4944-a24f-0e3df31d0fab_1029x278.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>On the question itself, it\u2019s not actually possible, since you\u2019ll know and you can\u2019t be sure you won\u2019t tell them, and you\u2019ll almost certainly act differently even if they never suspect or figure it out. One could even say \u2018the only way to have 100% certainty they\u2019ll never find out is if they\u2019re dead, so absolutely not.\u2019</p>\n<p>Literal \u2018any woman you wanted\u2019 with zero risk of discovery is a stupidly tempting offer. If you treat this in the spirit it was presumably intended, instead, and everyone was being fully honest including with themselves and fully understood what was on offer (as in literally whoever you\u2019d most want), presumably the ratio would be a lot higher.</p>\n<p>Unless, of course, the way you know your partner will never find out is that your partner (or you and the woman you\u2019d have the affair with) would be dead, in which case yeah bad deal, but that\u2019s presumably not this meant. mnnn oo</p>\n<p>How do we know this? Well, one big data point is this next poll.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You Are Still Single As Evidenced By Would</h4>\n\n\n<p>Um, guys, are almost none of you in a monogamous relationship? And even if you are single there\u2019s also the issue of risking the friendship. What are you all thinking?</p>\n<blockquote><p>Alice Is Playing: men attracted to women: how many of your female friends would you have a one-night stand with, if they offered?</p></blockquote>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oSLr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F179ae329-83f2-4f89-bfdb-049e8c1e01ca_1042x271.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Only 14% of men attracted to women answering this didn\u2019t have at least one female friend they would have a one night stand with? Presumably many of the others don\u2019t have the right female friend. Which means substantially more than 86% of them are not, for the most important practical purpose, in a monogamous relationship?</p>\n<p>Remember that other poll from Aella above, that showed at least 40% of people were in 8+ year relationships? And the one from Alice that 78% of herero men were in a 1+ year nominally monogamous relationship? Rut roh.</p>\n<p>Then on top of that, a majority are willing to do this with a majority of their female friends, not only that one they have that crush on.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t mean these people don\u2019t think they\u2019re in relationships. As we\u2019ve seen, they very much do think this. They might even be right. But don\u2019t tempt them.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019re Single Because You Lack Motivation</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5148219\">Paper reminds us</a> there is a 34 points gap (+34 versus +0) in net happiness for married versus unmarried people, with cohabitation only worth 10 points, and analyzes how this premium varies (slightly) by demographics.</p>\n<p>As the paper readily admits this tells us essentially nothing about what makes someone happy, because the whole thing is unfixibly confounded to hell. Happier, healthier and more successful people have an easier time getting married, and being unhappy leads to divorce. Both effects are epic in size.</p>\n<p>We do know the overall situation over a 50+ year time horizon is not good news, because while marrieds are slightly happier, the unmarrieds are somewhat less happy and more importantly are a larger percent of the population.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, I don\u2019t know what to do with all these graphs or how to cash it out in useful advice. One might say \u2018be the type of person who gets married,\u2019 perhaps.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019re Single Because Of Robin Hanson</h4>\n\n\n<p>As usual, never stop Robin Hansoning.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/robinhanson/status/1993823677306294343\">Robin Hanson</a>: You know how in romance stories the main characters hope to find a special relation, better than that which the ordinary people around them settle for? Your relations will probably be more like those of the ordinary folks, less like those of special main characters.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This has to be true, because math.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s less true than it appears, because the relations of \u2018main characters\u2019 feel special to them the same as everyone else\u2019s feel special. You could totally make a romantic comedy based on what I experienced, and you could also totally have me as a background character in someone else\u2019s romantic comedy, although probably I\u2019d be in a different genre entirely.</p>\n<p>To you, it will feel more like that of the special main characters, except that you don\u2019t need to have a false crisis in the third act.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019re Single Because You Did This Instead Of Going To Therapy</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/senatorshoshana/status/1920302549791371546\">Don\u2019t be whoever Casy Means is being here</a>.
