I sincerely try to keep it minimal, or at least have them walk me through the functionality line-by-line if I feel I'm out of my depth. But it's always easier and faster to YOLO it \u2013 an impluse I have to actively keep in check.</p>\n<p>Our AI minions are also exceptional tools for learning when you move too far towards the high-vibes-low-understanding end of the spectrum. I particularly like getting Claude to write me targeted exercises to practice new concepts when I get lost in generated functions or fail to implement something correctly sans-AI. Even though doubling-down up on engineering skills sometimes feels like learning to operate a textile loom in 1820.</p>"
