Projects that are able to\nsetup structure around the agent itself, to provide it with automated feedback on quality and correctness, have been able\nto push them to work on longer horizon tasks.\nThis back pressure helps the agent identify mistakes as it progresses and models are now good enough that this feedback\ncan keep them aligned to a task for much longer. As an engineer, this means you can increase your leverage by delegating\nprogressively more complex tasks to agents, while increasing trust that when completed they are at a satisfactory standard.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img alt=\"don&#x2019;t waste your back pressure\" class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://ghuntley.com/content/images/icon/favicon-8.ico\" /><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">[Moss]</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img alt=\"don&#x2019;t waste your back pressure\" src=\"https://ghuntley.com/content/images/thumbnail/plot_0.png\" /></div></a><figcaption><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">read this and internalise this</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Enjoy.

At this stage, it&apos;s not needed. Consider microservices and all the complexities that come with them. Now, consider what microservices would look like if the microservices (agents) themselves are non-deterministic&#x2014;a red hot mess.<br /><br />What&apos;s the opposite of microservices? A monolithic application. A single operating system process that scales vertically. Ralph is monolithic. Ralph works autonomously in a single repository as a single process that <strong>performs one task per loop</strong>. </blockquote><p>Software is now clay on the pottery wheel and if something isn&#x2019;t right then i just throw it back on the wheel to address items that need resolving. </p><p>Ralph is an orchestrator pattern where you allocate the array with the required backing specifications and then give it a goal then looping the goal.</p><p>It&apos;s important to <em>watch the loop</em> as that is where your personal development and learning will come from. When you see a failure domain &#x2013;  put on your engineering hat and resolve the problem so it never happens again.</p><p>In practice this means doing the loop manually via prompting or via automation with a pause that involves having to prcss CTRL+C to progress onto the next task. This is still ralphing as ralph is about getting the most out how the underlying models work through context engineering and that pattern is GENERIC and can be used for ALL TASKS.</p><p>In other news I&apos;ve been cooking on something called &quot;<a href=\"https://github.com/ghuntley/loom?ref=ghuntley.com\">The Weaving Loom</a>&quot;. The source code of loom can now be found on my GitHub; do not use it if your name is not Geoffrey Huntley. Loom is something that has been in my head for the last three years (and various prototypes were developed last year!) and it is essentially infrastructure for evolutionary software.

                "<p>Two recently-hyped developments in AI engineering have been Geoff Huntley\u2019s \u201cRalph Wiggum loop\u201d and Steve Yegge\u2019s \u201cGas Town\u201d. Huntley and Yegge are both respected software engineers with a long pedigree of actual projects. The Ralph loop is a sensible idea: force infinite test-time-compute by automatically restarting Claude Code whenever it runs out of steam. Gas Town is a platform for an idea that\u2019s been popular for a while (though in my view has never really worked): running a whole village of LLM agents that collaborate with each other to accomplish a task.</p>\n<p>So far, so good. But Huntley and Yegge have also been <a href=\"https://ghuntley.com/solana/\">posting</a> <a href=\"https://steve-yegge.medium.com/bags-and-the-creator-economy-249b924a621a\">about</a> $RALPH and $GAS, which are cryptocurrency coins built on top of the longstanding <a href=\"https://solana.com/\">Solana</a> cryptocurrency and the <a href=\"https://bags.fm/\">Bags</a> tool, which allows people to easily create their own crypto coins. What does $RALPH have to do with the Ralph Wiggum loop? What does $GAS have to do with Gas Town?</p>\n<p>From reading Huntley and Yegge\u2019s posts, it seems like what happened was this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Some crypto trader created a \u201c$GAS\u201d coin via Bags, configuring it to pay a portion of the trading fees to Steve Yegge (via his Twitter account)</li>\n<li>That trader, or others with the same idea, messaged Yegge on LinkedIn to tell him about his \u201cearnings\u201d (<a href=\"https://bags.fm/7pskt3A1Zsjhngazam7vHWjWHnfgiRump916Xj7ABAGS\">currently</a> $238,000), framing it as support for the Gas Town project</li>\n<li>Yegge took the free money and started <a href=\"https://steve-yegge.medium.com/bags-and-the-creator-economy-249b924a621a\">posting</a> about how exciting $GAS is as a way to fund open-source software creators</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So what does $GAS have to do with Gas Town (or $RALPH with Ralph Wiggum)? From a technical perspective, the answer is <strong>nothing</strong>. Gas Town is an open-source GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown\">repository</a> that you can clone, edit and run without ever interacting with the $GAS coin. Likewise for <a href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum\">Ralph</a>. Buying $GAS or $RALPH does not unlock any new capabilities in the tools. All it does is siphon a little bit of money to Yegge and Huntley, and increase the value of the $GAS or $RALPH coins.</p>\n<p>Of course, that\u2019s why these coins exist in the first place. This is a new variant of an old <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airdrop_(cryptocurrency)\">\u201cairdropping\u201d</a> cryptocurrency tactic. The classic problem with \u201cmemecoins\u201d is that it\u2019s hard to give people a reason to buy them, even at very low prices, because they famously have no staying power. That\u2019s why many successful memecoins rely on celebrity power, like Eric Adams\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/explaining-eric-adams-crypto-token-launch/6444591/\">\u201cNYC Token\u201d</a> or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/$Trump\">$TRUMP</a> coin. But how do you convince a celebrity to get involved in your <del>grift</del> business venture?</p>\n<p>This is where <a href=\"https://bags.fm/\">Bags</a> comes in. Bags allows you to nominate a Twitter account as the beneficiary (or \u201cfee earner\u201d) of your coin. The person behind that Twitter account doesn\u2019t have to agree, or even know that you\u2019re doing it. Once you accumulate a nominal market cap (for instance, by moving a bunch of your own money onto the coin), you can then message the owner of that Twitter account and say \u201chey, all these people are supporting you via crypto, and you can collect your money right now if you want!\u201d Then you either subtly hint that promoting the coin would cause that person to make more money, or you wait for them to realize it themselves<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/rss.xml#fn-1\">1</a></sup>. Once they start posting about it, you\u2019ve bootstrapped your own celebrity coin.</p>\n<p>This system relies on your celebrity target being dazzled by receiving a large sum of free money. If you came to them <em>before</em> the money was there, they might ask questions like \u201cwhy wouldn\u2019t people just directly donate to me?\u201d, or \u201care these people who think they\u2019re supporting me going to lose all their money?\u201c. But in the warm glow of a few hundred thousand dollars, it\u2019s easy to think that it\u2019s all working out excellently.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, this is why AI open-source software engineers make such great targets. The fact that they\u2019re open-source software engineers means that (a) a few hundred thousand dollars is enough to dazzle them<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/rss.xml#fn-2\">2</a></sup>, and (b) their fans are technically-engaged enough to be able to figure out how to buy cryptocurrency. Working in AI also means that there\u2019s a fresh pool of hype to draw from (the general hype around cryptocurrency being somewhat dry by now). On top of that, the open-source AI community is fairly small. Yegge <a href=\"https://steve-yegge.medium.com/bags-and-the-creator-economy-249b924a621a\">mentions</a> in his post that he wouldn\u2019t have taken the offer seriously if Huntley hadn\u2019t already accepted it.</p>\n<p>If you couldn\u2019t tell, I think this whole thing is largely predatory. Bags seems to me to be offering crypto-airdrop-pump-and-dumps-as-a-service, where niche celebrities can turn their status as respected community figures into cold hard cash. The people who pay into this are either taken in by the pretense that they\u2019re sponsoring open-source work (in a way orders of magnitude less efficient than just donating money directly), or by the hope that they\u2019re going to win big when the coin goes \u201cto the moon\u201d (which effectively never happens). </p>\n<p>The celebrities will make a little bit of money, for their part in it, but the lion\u2019s share of the reward will go to the actual grifters: the insiders who primed the coin and can sell off into the flood of community members who are convinced to buy.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>Bags even <a href=\"https://bags.fm/how-it-works\">offers</a> a \u201cDid You Get Bagged? \ud83d\udcb0\ud83e\udef5\u201d section in their docs, encouraging the celebrity targets to share the coin, and framing the whole thing as coming from \u201cyour community\u201d.</p>\n<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/rss.xml#fnref-1\">\u21a9</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>This isn\u2019t a dig - that amount of money would dazzle me too!
