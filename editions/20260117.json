Projects that are able to\nsetup structure around the agent itself, to provide it with automated feedback on quality and correctness, have been able\nto push them to work on longer horizon tasks.\nThis back pressure helps the agent identify mistakes as it progresses and models are now good enough that this feedback\ncan keep them aligned to a task for much longer. As an engineer, this means you can increase your leverage by delegating\nprogressively more complex tasks to agents, while increasing trust that when completed they are at a satisfactory standard.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img alt=\"don&#x2019;t waste your back pressure\" class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://ghuntley.com/content/images/icon/favicon-8.ico\" /><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">[Moss]</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img alt=\"don&#x2019;t waste your back pressure\" src=\"https://ghuntley.com/content/images/thumbnail/plot_0.png\" /></div></a><figcaption><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">read this and internalise this</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Enjoy.

You see ralph isn&#x2019;t just about forwards (building autonomously) or reverse mode (clean rooming) it&#x2019;s also a mind set that these computers can be indeed programmed.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><figcaption><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">watch this video to learn the mindset</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>I&#x2019;m there as an engineer just as I was in the brick by brick era but instead am programming the loop, automating my job function and removing the need to hire humans. </p><p>Everyone right now is going through their zany period - just like i did with forward mode and building software AFK on full auto - however I hope that folks will come back down from orbit and remember this from the original ralph post.</p><blockquote>While I was in SFO, everyone seemed to be trying to crack on multi-agent, agent-to-agent communication and multiplexing. At this stage, it&apos;s not needed. Consider microservices and all the complexities that come with them. Now, consider what microservices would look like if the microservices (agents) themselves are non-deterministic&#x2014;a red hot mess.<br /><br />What&apos;s the opposite of microservices? A monolithic application. A single operating system process that scales vertically. Ralph is monolithic. Ralph works autonomously in a single repository as a single process that <strong>performs one task per loop</strong>. </blockquote><p>Software is now clay on the pottery wheel and if something isn&#x2019;t right then i just throw it back on the wheel to address items that need resolving. </p><p>Ralph is an orchestrator pattern where you allocate the array with the required backing specifications and then give it a goal then looping the goal.</p><p>It&apos;s important to <em>watch the loop</em> as that is where your personal development and learning will come from. When you see a failure domain &#x2013;  put on your engineering hat and resolve the problem so it never happens again.</p><p>In practice this means doing the loop manually via prompting or via automation with a pause that involves having to prcss CTRL+C to progress onto the next task. This is still ralphing as ralph is about getting the most out how the underlying models work through context engineering and that pattern is GENERIC and can be used for ALL TASKS.</p><p>In other news I&apos;ve been cooking on something called &quot;<a href=\"https://github.com/ghuntley/loom?ref=ghuntley.com\">The Weaving Loom</a>&quot;. The source code of loom can now be found on my GitHub; do not use it if your name is not Geoffrey Huntley. Loom is something that has been in my head for the last three years (and various prototypes were developed last year!) and it is essentially infrastructure for evolutionary software.
