                "<p>In <a href=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2025/social-media-scrapbook/\">my previous post</a>, I described my social media scrapbook \u2013 a tiny, private archive where I save conversations that I care about.</p>\n\n<p>The implementation is mine, but the ideas aren\u2019t: cultural heritage institutions have been thinking about how to preserve social media for years.\nThere\u2019s decades of theory and practice behind digital preservation, but social media presents some unique challenges.</p>\n\n<p>Institutional archiving has different constraints to individual collections \u2013 institutions serve a much wider audience, so their decisions need consistency and boundaries.\nMy own scrapbook is tiny and personal, and comparing it alongside institutional efforts really highlights the differences and difficulties.\nIt\u2019s why I usually call it a \u201cscrapbook\u201d, not an \u201carchive\u201d: it\u2019s informal and a bit chaotic, and that\u2019s fine because it\u2019s only for me.</p>\n\n<p>In this post, I\u2019ll explain what I see as the key issues facing institutional social media archiving: what can be saved, what resists preservation, and how context is so hard to keep.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"table_of_contents\">\n  <h3>Table of contents</h3>\n\n  <ul>\n    \n      <li>\n        <a

saved</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-scale-of-social-media-is-overwhelming\">The scale of social media is overwhelming</h3>\n\n<p>Social media exists at a scale that\u2019s hard to comprehend: billions of posts, with millions more being added each day.</p>\n\n<p>This makes it difficult for anyone to choose what to preserve, because any one person can only know a tiny fragment of the whole.\nMaking a choice inevitably introduces selection bias, and I\u2019ve spoken to many people who\u2019d like to avoid that bias by \u201ccollecting everything\u201d \u2013 but that\u2019s far beyond the capacity of any institution.</p>\n\n<p>Since they can\u2019t collect everything, institutions create rules \u2013 collection policies that define what\u2019s in-scope.\nThese rules are meant to ensure consistency, fairness, and reduce individual bias, but they force archivists to draw boundaries in a medium that inherently resists them.</p>\n\n<p>Social media isn\u2019t a sequence of isolated posts; it\u2019s a dense, interconnected graph.\nA\u00a0single post only makes sense in context \u2013 the replies, the people, the topic du jour.\nHow much of this context do you gather?\nHow many hops out do you follow?\nDo you save the whole thread, every reply, every linked account?\nHow do you prevent scope creep from sucking in everything?</p>\n\n<p>My personal scrapbook is subjective and inconsistent, because the only audience is me.\nMy \u201ccollection policy\u201d is pure vibes \u2013 I save threads I think are interesting; I keep posts that I find moving; I prune replies that are embarrassing or unhelpful.\nIf I\u2019m inconsistent or I delete the wrong thing, nobody else is affected.</p>\n\n<p>Institutions can\u2019t be that casual.\nThey need durable, defensible rules about where their collection starts and ends.\nOn social media, where every post is context to a larger tangle of conversation, drawing that boundary is a major challenge.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"private-and-disappearing-content\">Private and disappearing content</h3>\n\n<p>Social media archiving efforts often concentrate on publicly available, long-lasting content, which excludes other types of material \u2013 even though they make up an ever-growing proportion of social media.\nTwo major categories stand out:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Private social media \u2013 direct messages, private accounts, closed groups, paywalled forums.</li>\n  <li>Ephemeral features \u2013 content that deliberately disappears or expires. \nThink Snapchat, Instagram Stories, or one-time messages.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Collecting this material is difficult.\nTechnically, it\u2019s behind authentication walls or interfaces that most web archiving tools can\u2019t reach.\nAnd even if you save it, can you share it?\nEthically, archivists must be careful not to violate social norms or user expectations.</p>\n\n<p>It isn\u2019t impossible, and I\u2019ve seen a handful of projects capture private and ephemeral media \u2013 for example, researchers analysing Instagram Stories and their use in political campaigns.\nThese efforts rely on a patchwork of methods: accessing content through user logins, browser plugins, even taking screenshots.\nThey tend to be small, targeted, and short-lived.</p>\n\n<p>My scrapbook has a small amount of private content, mostly conversations between me and locked accounts on Twitter.\nI\u2019m comfortable with that because I was part of those conversations, and it\u2019s a private archive.\nI\u2019m not sharing it with anybody else, so I don\u2019t think my friends would begrudge me keeping a copy.\nI\u00a0haven\u2019t saved any ephemeral content.</p>\n\n<p>Private and ephemeral posts have a different dynamic from public timelines.\nPeople can be more personal, vulnerable, and candid when they know their posts can\u2019t be seen by anyone, forever.\nMaybe those moments won\u2019t appear in social media archives \u2013 but if so, we should acknowledge that limitation, and what stories it leaves out.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-experience-of-social-media\">The experience of social media</h3>\n\n<p>Social media is more than just posts, words, and images \u2013 it\u2019s the experience.\nThe interface, interaction design, and the algorithms that shape our feeds are rarely captured in archives.</p>\n\n<p>For example, consider TikTok and the rise of vertical-swipe video.\nBecause the next video is just a swipe away, creators structure their content to hook you immediately, and keep your attention throughout \u2013 a shift from the slower pace of older videos.\nIf you only save the video file and not the swiping experience, it\u2019s harder to understand why the creator made those choices.</p>\n\n<p>Even more elusive is the \u201calgorithm\u201d, the black box that decide what posts appear in our timeline.\nThese algorithms shape culture itself \u2013 amplifying some voices, suppressing others, deciding which ideas can spread \u2013 but their inner workings are deliberately opaque and impossible to archive.\nTheir behaviour is a closely-guarded commercial secret.</p>\n\n<p>A purely technical approach to preserving the experience is doomed to fail \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean all is lost.\nWe can document how these experiences shaped the flow of content: screenshots, screen recordings, detailed descriptions.\nOral histories can give future audiences a sense of what it was like to exist in these digital ecosystems.</p>\n\n<p>One of my favourite parts of any archive is the everyday.\nOften, something isn\u2019t written down because it seems \u201cobvious\u201d at the time \u2013 but decades later, that knowledge has vanished.\nSocial media is evolving quickly, and now is the time to capture these experiences.\nFuture generations, looking back once the landscape settles, will want to understand the path that led there.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rules-resistance-and-responsibility\">Rules, resistance, and responsibility</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-if-platforms-resist-preservation\">What if platforms resist preservation?</h3>\n\n<p>In the early 2000s, many platforms were far more supportive of digital preservation.\nPublic APIs were common, scraping was largely tolerated, and some companies even collaborated with heritage institutions.</p>\n\n<p>Twitter is the poster child of this sort of corporate endorsement.\nTheir public API allowed a flourishing ecosystem of third-party clients and research projects; researchers could easily assemble datasets; the Library of Congress even attempted to preserve <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/26/573609499/library-of-congress-will-no-longer-archive-every-tweet\">every public tweet</a> between 2006 and 2017.\nThe project stalled and remains largely inaccessible today \u2013 but it would never even get started in 2025.</p>\n\n<p>Today, most platforms resist being preserved, archived, or downloaded en masse.\nAPIs are restricted or paywalled, rate limits are strict, and scraping is aggressively blocked.\nThe rise of generative AI has accelerated this trend, as companies realise their data is valuable for model training.\nWhy give it away for free when you can ask for money?</p>\n\n<p>Reddit is the most recent example.\nThey <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/757538/reddit-internet-archive-wayback-machine-block-limit\">blocked the Internet Archive</a> after some AI companies used it to access posts for free \u2013 posts for which Google pays Reddit <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/22/24080165/google-reddit-ai-training-data\">millions to access</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Attempts to preserve content programmatically are increasingly limited, which makes it difficult to archive at scale.\nIn my scrapbook, I replace APIs with entering data by hand, but that\u2019s only practical if you\u2019re saving a small amount of data.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"do-people-want-to-be-preserved\">Do people want to be preserved?</h3>\n\n<p>A lot of web archiving has historically ignored consent.\nIf something is on the public web, many archives consider it eligible for capture \u2013 but preserving a post means it\u2019s preserved forever.\nEmbarrassing thoughts or personal pictures can\u2019t be deleted once they\u2019ve been archived.</p>\n\n<p>Not everyone would agree to their posts being permanently preserved, even if they use services like the Wayback Machine.\nWe see this in the popularity of private accounts, closed forums, and ephemeral posts \u2013 people want control over how and when their posts are seen.\nGenerative AI and the use of social media for model training has made people even more sensitive about their data.</p>\n\n<p>The general public often ignores copyright and privacy \u2013 how many people use images they found online with <a href=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2025/anonymised-art/\">no regard for the creator</a>? \u2013 but institutions hold themselves to a higher standard.</p>\n\n<p>A strict ethical stance would require explicit consent from every creator.\nInstitutions often use donor agreements, where you allow them to keep your material and sign away the right to remove it afterwards \u2013 but that solution is hard to scale to social media, where a single conversation may involve dozens of people.</p>\n\n<p>It would also mean losing huge amounts of historically valuable material.\nIt would exclude orphaned accounts, abandoned platforms, and users who have died or lost their password.\nAnd web archives preserve content from companies, politicians, and public figures, helping keep them accountable \u2013 but these figures would rarely consent to archiving they don\u2019t control.</p>\n\n<p>One interesting approach is Bluesky\u2019s proposal <a href=\"https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/blob/main/0008-user-intents/README.md\">User Intents for Data Reuse</a>, letting users declare how they want their posts to be reused, such as for AI training or archiving.\nTechnology alone is not the solution \u2013 you also need enforcement \u2013 but this feels like a step in the right direction.</p>\n\n<p>I like the idea of a balanced approach \u2013 collecting material from public figures is fair game; anything from private citizens needs explicit consent.\nOf course, that\u2019s easier said than done, and it\u2019s tricky to codify that as a well-defined rule \u2013 but to me, \u201canything publicly available\u201d feels increasingly insufficient as an ethical guideline.</p>\n\n<p>In my personal scrapbook, I don\u2019t have a formal consent process \u2013 something I feel comfortable with because my archive is small, private, and only my own reference.\nMy guiding rule is \u201cdon\u2019t be a creep\u201d.\nI\u00a0don\u2019t save anything I think the original author would be uncomfortable knowing I kept.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"laws-and-legislation\">Laws and legislation</h3>\n\n<p>Consent is a preference, but legislation is a hard boundary.\nDigital collections are affected by a patchwork of laws \u2013 copyright, privacy, data protection rules like the <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/individual-rights/individual-rights/right-to-erasure/\">right to erasure</a>, and even content-related restrictions.\nInstitutions must ensure their collections comply with all relevant laws, even if those obligations conflict with the goals of long-term preservation.</p>\n\n<p>Social media archiving is especially tricky.\nAutomated, bulk collection can easily capture illegal or sensitive content, and mistakes may go unnoticed.</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s why I prefer a targeted, human-reviewed approach.\nIt slows you down, but reading all the material allows archivists to catch potential issues before content becomes a liability.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 id=\"understanding-what-youve-saved\">Understanding what you\u2019ve saved</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-do-you-search-your-collection\">How do you search your collection?</h3>\n\n<p>An archive is useless if you can\u2019t look at what you\u2019ve saved.\nThis is often a problem in social media archives: we can save posts at incredible speeds, but we can\u2019t search them in any meaningful way.</p>\n\n<p>Web archiving often saves page-by-page, one page per post, like the Wayback Machine.\nThis scales beautifully for capture, but terribly for discovery.\nYou can retrieve a post if you know its URL, but you can\u2019t find everything about a single topic or written by a given author.</p>\n\n<p>Traditional archives solve this with cataloguing: humans write descriptions, and researchers use those to find what they need.\nBut that model can buckle if you try to save social media at scale: machines can save thousands of posts in the time it takes a human to describe just one.</p>\n\n<p>In my personal scrapbook, I add keyword tags to every conversation.\nThey\u2019re fast, informal, and effective.\nIf I want something specific, I can filter by tag and find it instantly.\nSince I\u2019m the only person who uses these tags, I can define them in a way I like and change them when I decide.\nIf I was in an institutional context, I\u2019d use a controlled vocabulary like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Subject_Headings\">LCSH</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Subject_Headings\">MeSH</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These light-touch keywords feel like a realistic middle ground: human-scale data that\u2019s quick to apply, but rich enough to cut through the fog.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whos-the-person-behind-the-profile\">Who\u2019s the person behind the profile?</h3>\n\n<p>Identity on social media is a hard problem.\nMany accounts are anonymous or pseudonymous, and most people have accounts scattered across multiple platforms.\nThis makes it tricky to track somebody\u2019s presence on social media, because there\u2019s rarely a mapping between a person\u2019s real-world identity and the accounts they use online.\nOften, this anonymity is intentional.</p>\n\n<p>This ambiguity creates a big headache for support teams at social media companies.\nWhen somebody asks for help regaining access to an account because they\u2019ve lost the password or been hacked, how can the platform be sure they\u2019re the real owner?\nThat question is even harder to answer if you\u2019re outside the company.</p>\n\n<p>Institutions and researchers care about identity because it provides context and authority: <em>who wrote this, and how much can we trust their words?</em>\nSocial media makes this hard, because many usernames don\u2019t tell you anything about the person behind them.\nAlthough institutions have tools to connect people across records, you need to know who the person is first!</p>\n\n<p>My personal scrapbook sidesteps this complexity.\nNearly all of the conversations it contains are with friends I know well, so I can easily connect their identities across different services.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"implicit-knowledge-cultural-context-and-memes\">Implicit knowledge, cultural context, and memes</h3>\n\n<p>Social media relies on shared knowledge: current events, in-jokes, and memes.\nWithout this context, the meaning of a post can fade \u2013 or an entirely new meaning can take its place.</p>\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t a new problem \u2013 all human communication requires context \u2013 but social media <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to_eleven\">takes it to eleven</a>.\nThe pace and brevity are a fertile breeding ground for memes whose origins disappear almost immediately.\nLog off for a day, and you\u2019ll return to posts that make no sense at all.\nYou missed the moment that sparked the meme.\nImagine how much harder it is to understand if you arrive years \u2013 or decades \u2013 later.</p>\n\n<p>You can try to fill in the gap with catalogue descriptions, but that\u2019s only possible if somebody understands the references well enough to describe them.\nWith social media\u2019s scale and speed, it\u2019s impossible for anybody to know all the jokes, memes, and ideas that might affect a post.</p>\n\n<p>In my personal scrapbook, I rely on my memory to provide that context.\nI\u00a0don\u2019t write longer descriptions, and I don\u2019t know how much I\u2019ll remember.\nSome posts that made sense in 2020 may be baffling in 2030, others will still be crystal clear.\nOnly one way to find out!</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 id=\"we-wont-save-everything-but-we-can-save-something\">We won\u2019t save everything, but we can save something</h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps we can\u2019t preserve social media perfectly, but that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t try.\nEvery archive ever assembled is incomplete, but they still have immense value. \nCapturing public posts, threads, or conversations \u2013 even if we lose some of the context or ephemeral content \u2013 helps preserve a record of cultural history that could otherwise be lost.</p>\n\n<p>Social media archiving may be a new endeavour for large institutions, but it\u2019s not a new idea.\nThere are small, ad-hoc projects happening everywhere, and there\u2019s lots of prior art to learn from.\nJust today I came across <a href=\"https://posty.1sland.social\">Posty</a>, a tool for creating archive a Mastodon account as a static site.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m always excited when I see people building tools to save tiny corners of the web \u2013 posts from a single account, fanworks from a tight-knit community, or shared advice from a community wiki.\nWhenever a platform disappears or looks shaky, there\u2019s a renewed interest to minimise the loss.</p>\n\n<p>Social media archiving will never be perfect, but it\u2019s possible, and I\u2019m excited to see how institutions rise to the challenge.</p>\n\n\n    <p>[If the formatting of this post looks odd in your feed reader, <a

One of the comments struck me a bit more though - Bjartr linked to the <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2015-12-09\">HN frontpage from exactly 10 years ago</a>, i.e. December 2015. I was reading through the discussions of 10 years ago and mentally grading them for prescience when I realized that an LLM might actually be a lot better at this task. I copy pasted one of the article+comment threads manually into ChatGPT 5.1 Thinking and it gave me a beautiful analysis of what people thought + what actually happened in retrospect, even better and significantly more detailed than what I was doing manually. I realized that this task is actually a really good fit for LLMs and I was looking for excuses to vibe code something with the newly released Opus 4.5, so I got to work. I'm going to get all the front pages of December (31 days, 30 articles per day), get ChatGPT 5.1 Thinking to do the analysis, and present everything in a nice way for historical reading.</p>\n<p>There are two macro reasons for why I think the exercise is interesting more generally:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I believe it is quite possible and desirable to train your forward future predictor given training and effort.</li>\n<li>I was reminded again of my tweets that said <em>\"Be good, future LLMs are watching\"</em>. You can take that in many directions, but here I want to focus on the idea that future LLMs <strong>are</strong> watching. Everything we do today might be scrutinized in great detail in the future because doing so will be \"free\". A lot of the ways people behave currently I think make an implicit \"security by obscurity\" assumption. But if intelligence really does become too cheap to meter, it will become possible to do a perfect reconstruction and synthesis of everything. LLMs are watching (or humans using them might be). Best to be good.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Vibe coding the actual project was relatively painless and took about 3 hours with Opus 4.5, with a few hickups but overall very impressive. The repository is on GitHub here: <a href=\"https://github.com/karpathy/hn-time-capsule\">karpathy/hn-time-capsule</a>. Here is the progression of what the code does:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Given a date, download the frontpage of 30 articles</li>\n<li>For each article, download/parse the article itself and the full comment thread using Algolia API.</li>\n<li>Package up everything into a markdown prompt asking for the analysis. Here is the prompt prefix I used:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span>The following is an article that appeared on Hacker News 10 years ago, and the discussion thread.\n\nLet's use our benefit of hindsight now in 6 sections:\n\n1. Give a brief summary of the article and the discussion thread.\n2. What ended up happening to this topic? (research the topic briefly and write a summary)\n3. Give out awards for &quot;Most prescient&quot; and &quot;Most wrong&quot; comments, considering what happened.\n4. Mention any other fun or notable aspects of the article or discussion.\n5. Give out grades to specific people for their comments, considering what happened.\n6. At the end, give a final score (from 0-10) for how interesting this article and its retrospect analysis was.\n\nAs for the format of Section 5, use the header &quot;Final grades&quot; and follow it with simply an unordered list of people and their grades in the format of &quot;name: grade (optional comment)&quot;. Here is an example:\n\nFinal grades\n- speckx: A+ (excellent predictions on ...)\n- tosh: A (correctly predicted this or that ...)\n- keepamovin: A\n- bgwalter: D\n- fsflover: F (completely wrong on ...)\n\nYour list may contain more people of course than just this toy example. Please follow the format exactly because I will be parsing it programmatically. The idea is that I will accumulate the grades for each account to identify the accounts that were over long periods of time the most prescient or the most wrong.\n\nAs for the format of Section 6, use the prefix &quot;Article hindsight analysis interestingness score:&quot; and then the score (0-10) as a number. Give high scores to articles/discussions that are prominent, notable, or interesting in retrospect. Give low scores in cases where few predictions are made, or the topic is very niche or obscure, or the discussion is not very interesting in retrospect.\n\nHere is an example:\nArticle hindsight analysis interestingness score: 8\n---\n</pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>Submit prompt to GPT 5.1 Thinking via the OpenAI API</li>\n<li>Collect and parse the results</li>\n<li>Render the results into static HTML web pages for easy viewing</li>\n<li>Host the html result pages on my website: <a href=\"https://karpathy.ai/hncapsule/\">https://karpathy.ai/hncapsule/</a></li>\n<li>Host all the intermediate results of the <code>data</code> directory if someone else would like to play. It's the file <code>data.zip</code> under the exact same url prefix (intentionally avoiding a direct link).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I spent a few hours browsing around and found it to be very interesting.

You can also scroll all the way down to find the noise of HN, which I think we're all familiar with too :)</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://github.com/karpathy/hn-time-capsule\">code</a> (wait, Opus' code?) on GitHub can be used to reproduce or tweak the results. Running 31 days of 30 articles through GPT 5.1 Thinking meant <code>31 * 30 =</code> 930 LLM queries and cost about $58 and somewhere around ~1 hour. The LLM megaminds of the future might find this kind of a thing a lot easier, a lot faster and a lot cheaper.</p>"

You can find it on GitHub</a></p>\n<p>A couple months back, the folks at StrongDM open sourced <a href=\"https://leash.strongdm.ai/\">Leash</a>, a tool for Docker and macOS that gives you really granular hooks to control your coding agents. You can allow and deny individual network connections and syscalls. On the frontend, there's a slick webui that gives you a realtime view of what your agents are doing and the ability to toggle access to resources on the fly.  The whole thing is built around Amazon Cedar.</p>\n<p>On the backend, they've done some really impressive work to instrument Docker to make this possible. But that's not half as cool as what they've done for the macOS native version of the sandbox. Since they're an enterprise security company, they managed to talk Apple into giving them the entitlement to build a system extension that provides a syscall and network filter. Think Little Snitch, but with filesystem and syscall control, too.  And then they built a wrapper that runs your coding agent with that magic enabled, giving you access to the same dashboards as the Docker implementation.</p>\n<p>After spending a little bit of time with Leash, I was a convert to the idea of running my agents in containers.</p>\n<p>Leash is built to support enterprises running huge swarms of agents who need very fine-grained access control. I usually have a dozen at most. In a lot of ways, it's overkill for what I need.</p>\n<p>What I wanted was simpler: spin up a dev container preconfigured for a coding agent, with the right credentials and source code mounted, and let the agent run in\u00a0<code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code>\u00a0mode without worrying about it escaping.</p>\n<p>So I built <a href=\"https://github.com/obra/packnplay\"><code>packnplay</code></a>, a wrapper around Docker/Orbstack/etc that gives you an easy way to spin up a relatively safe, ephemeral container to let your agent go wild.</p>\n<p><code>packnplay run claude --dangerously-skip-permissions</code> is all it takes to set up a new container.</p>\n<p><a class=\"glightbox\" href=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251210-122730.png\"><img alt=\"pasted image 20251210 122730\" src=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251210-122730.png\" /></a></p>\n<p>Your project's source mounts at the same path you'd see it outside the container. So if I'm working on Superpowers at <code>/Users/jesse/git/superpowers/</code>, that's exactly where the directory will be mounted inside the container.</p>\n<p>To get another session in the same container, just run something like this from the directory where you launched packnplay:</p>\n<p><code>packnplay run --reconnect bash</code></p>\n<p>Containers don't automatically shut down when your agent session disconnects, so it's possible to restart to pick up config changes, etc.</p>\n<p>The default container and settings runtime support a whole bunch of coding agents today: claude, gemini-cli, codex, copilot, qwen-code, amp, opencode.</p>\n<p>By far, the most complicated part of all of this was figuring out how to make sure that Claude Code doesn't log you out and that your Claude Code settings don't get corrupted when you're running agents both inside and outside the container. (The very, very short version is that <code>~/.claude.json</code> is constantly rewritten by Claude Code and their file locking doesn't work across container boundaries, so we give your containers a standalone <code>.claude.json</code>.  Similarly, if you reuse the same Claude Code subscription token across two different operating systems, it appears that Anthropic's anti-fraud systems kick in and expire the token. So <code>packnplay</code> maintains its own Claude Code subscription token for use in your containers.)</p>\n<p>The default container comes prepopulated with common tooling for typescript, go, python, rust, etc.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lastweekinaws.com/\">Corey Quinn</a> contributed AWS tooling and configurable AWS credential management. If you're building with AWS, things should just work. There's basic configuration for GCP, as well.</p>\n<p><a class=\"glightbox\" href=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251210-124238.png\"><img alt=\"pasted image 20251210 124238\" src=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251210-124238.png\" /></a></p>\n<p>You can configure <code>packnplay</code> to proxy your Git and GitHub credentials into containers.</p>\n<p>And, if the default container doesn't float your boat, you can use a standard devcontainer config. <code>packnplay</code> will transparently pick up the .devcontainer config from your project's repo and use that in preference to our default container.</p>\n<p>With automatic worktree support, custom environment variable 'bundles', and port forwarding, <code>packnplay</code> ought to be able to match your existing workflows.</p>\n<p>Give your agents a safe place to do their thing with <a href=\"https://github.com/obra/packnplay\"><code>packnplay</code></a>. If <code>packnplay</code> doesn't yet support your favorite agent, I'd love a PR.</p>"

For years, Taiwan&#8217;s TSMC has been the only company capable of producing the most advanced AI chips; since Taiwan is a geopolitical flashpoint, this is a constant threat to US tech ambitions. Last month, a new startup called Substrate announced it had developed technology that would let it manufacture 100% Made In America chips every bit the equal of TSMC&#8217;s. If true, this would be revolutionary. But Fox Chapel finds worrying signs, like that the company&#8217;s founder &#8220;is a known con artist involved in such other things as [claiming to have solved] nuclear fusion and stealing $2.5M in a Kickstarter scam&#8221; or that &#8220;the company&#8217;s job postings are nonsensical and AI-generated.&#8221; This is enough for me; the question now becomes how so many people were taken in - the company got $150 million from investors led by Peter Thiel, was endorsed by the Trump administration, and received positive portrayals in Semianalysis, NYT, and The Free Press. I don&#8217;t understand business, and I know that sometimes you can hyperstition a technology into existence by betting sufficiently hard on a charismatic young founder and eliding the difference between &#8220;this is already real&#8221; and &#8220;this might become real if we all believe hard enough&#8221;, but this is a new and worrying level of hopium. Interested to hear from anyone who either believes in Substrate or thinks they understand how so many people fell for it.</p><p><strong>5: </strong>A <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24797\">recent paper</a> asked AIs whether they were conscious while monitoring them for signatures of deception, role-playing, and people-pleasing; it concluded that the AIs &#8220;genuinely&#8221; &#8220;believe&#8221; they are conscious, but sometimes try to deceive people into thinking they aren&#8217;t. <a href=\"https://x.com/nostalgebraist/status/1985192211722752333\">Nostalgebraist tries to replicate this (X)</a> and gets more ambiguous results; he says we probably can&#8217;t conclude anything just yet.

The statistics say that several European countries (including Ireland and the UK) give very generous foreign aid. But this is misleading: accounting conventions let countries count money spent on supporting asylum seekers in the donor country as &#8220;foreign aid&#8221;, even though the money never leaves the country&#8217;s borders. This is dangerous, because it makes it easy for countries to fund their asylum programs by cutting actual foreign aid: since they&#8217;re the same line-item on the budget, they won&#8217;t officially fail whatever foreign aid pledges they&#8217;ve made, and it&#8217;s hard for voters to notice. Ireland has so far resisted the temptation to do this, but Britain has succumbed to it.</p><p><strong>10: </strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Acutis\">St. Carlo Acutis</a> (1991 - 2006) is the unofficial patron saint of the Internet and &#8220;first millennial saint&#8221;.

If you think this sounds nice but maybe short of beatific, you&#8217;re in good company; his sainthood is something of a mystery, with Wikipedia saying that &#8220;even those with a deep devotion to him struggle to pinpoint his specific actions that led to his canonisation&#8221;, and an Economist article admitting that &#8220;nothing in his sparse life story explains that this ordinary-seeming teenage boy is about to become the first great saint of the 21st century&#8221;. Also &#8220;In that same interview, Acutis&#8217;s childhood best friend claimed he did not remember Acutis as a &#8216;very pious boy&#8217;, nor did he even know that Carlo was religious.&#8221; I&#8217;m fine with this; God speaks to each generation in their own tongue, and it is only proper that the first Millennial saint be a random person who hyperstitioned himself into sainthood with a viral website.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kkfL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbcffc254-0a35-4360-baaf-2ffae8c00e64_769x931.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"401.9401820546164\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kkfL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbcffc254-0a35-4360-baaf-2ffae8c00e64_769x931.png\" width=\"332\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>11: </strong>Tangentially related: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_To_Rot\">St. Peter To Rot</a></p><p><strong>12: </strong>When a new AI model comes out, the companies typically take down the old version over the protests of researchers, hobbyists, people who think the old model was their boyfriend, and anyone else who wants access to obsolete models for some reason.

The modern role of &#8220;capitalist&#8221; combines two things: performing high-status jobs like CEO and VC, and being a person who happens to have lots of money and sips cocktails on a yacht as passive investment income rolls in. From a socialist point of view, the first role provides cover for the second; if people ask &#8220;the rich&#8221; to justify their wealth, they can argue that they perform socially useful CEO and VC jobs, or at least inherited their money from somebody who did. But after AIs can do CEO and VC jobs better than humans, the capitalists will lose their excuse - and this at exactly the time that they&#8217;re becoming richer than ever (because AGI will drive up the rate of return on investment) and everyone else is becoming poorer than ever (because AI has taken their jobs). Bear argues that the only stable equilibria are either some kind of socialism/redistribution, or the capitalists pulling an AI-assisted coup to maintain their advantage. </p><p><strong>15: </strong><a href=\"https://blueprint-research.com/polling/build-a-dem-workshop/\">Blueprint Polls</a>: according to voters, what would the perfect Democratic candidate look like?

The states have signaled willingness to regulate AI pretty hard, so Big Tech has been pushing for AI pre-emption to (in their opinion) prevent an overly complicated patchwork of regulations, or (in their opponents&#8217; opinion) shift everything to a Republican Congress that will drop the ball on regulation entirely. After their first attempt in June was defeated by a coalition of anti-tech liberals and anti-tech conservatives, we discussed (<a href=\"https://www.hyperdimensional.co/p/be-it-enacted\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://writing.antonleicht.me/p/a-preemption-deal-worth-making\">2</a>) the effort by moderates on both sides to create a compromise proposal which pre-empted state laws but guaranteed good federal regulation on important topics. The most recent news is that extremists sidelined the moderates and <a href=\"https://ari.us/ai-law-preemption-dropped-from-ndaa/\">tried to slip a hardline preemption deal with no compromises into the National Defense Authorization Act</a>, a defense budget bill which is notoriously secretive and hard for the public to learn about. This didn&#8217;t work; some of the same coalition, plus a group of Republican state legislators including Ron DeSantis, <a href=\"https://www.transformernews.ai/p/another-preemption-failure-shows-ai-industry-losing-battle-regulation-scalise\">pressured the GOP to drop it</a>. The next battleground is <a href=\"https://www.transformernews.ai/p/exclusive-heres-the-draft-trump-executive\">a potential Trump executive order</a>; although Trump cannot constitutionally ban states from regulating AI, he will threaten them with various consequences like lawsuits or withdrawal of federal funding.

I guess I can&#8217;t disagree with this poll - it seems well-done - but I still wonder whether something is being missed. Maybe it didn&#8217;t make the ~50% of voters who are naturally liberal desert the cause, but it energized conservatives in a way that might otherwise not have happened? <strong>Related</strong>, <a href=\"https://x.com/robertwiblin/status/1996883171020038459\">from Rob Wiblin on X</a>, on balance Britons think the government response to COVID was not strict enough.</p><p><strong>32: </strong>Related: Back when neoreaction was a big deal, I occasionally discussed posts by neoreactionary blogger Spandrell of <em>Bloody Shovel</em>. If you&#8217;re wondering what happened to him, you can read his 2024 <a href=\"https://spandrell.ch/2024/3/3/a-post-mortem-on-neoreaction\">Post-Mortem Of Neoreaction</a> here, where he discusses how he fell out of love with the movement (warning: he has not fallen out of love with racial slurs). </p><blockquote><p>As a former fascist sympathizer, I can see why [fascism is on the downswing]. The allure of fascism in 2024 is much, much diminished. For a few reasons. A big one was COVID. See, the point of fascism is that Collective Action is necessary to have nice things. We need a strong government committed to the good of the people. Yarvin showed his preference early when he started his new Substack by quoting Cicero&#8217;s phrase &#8220;Salus populi suprema lex&#8221;. The health of the people is the most important law. Cicero wasn&#8217;t a fascist of course, nor is Yarvin really; a big point of fascism is to narrowly define the populus as an ethnic group with demonstrable ties to blood. That makes the government&#8217;s ties to the people stronger, increasing their commitment to do Good Collective Action. Which is important. Very important. A lot of good things can come of intelligently done Collective Action. Fascist Italy made the trains run on time. Nazi Germany fixed the terrible Weimar economy. East Asian countries are all effectively fascist states, if with less ideological baggage (yellows just aren&#8217;t like that), and they are all nice, clean, safe places with healthy economies. Fascism is not a panacea but it works, when you let it. Strong government can be pretty neat.</p><p>So why is strong government less appealing these days? Well, COVID happened. And our governments were pretty damn strong in dealing with it. They made strong laws and enforced them. And what did they do with their power? Absolutely retarded shit. They destroyed the world economy and made 95% of people completely miserable for 18 months. Up to 3 long years in some places. Again, as an Orient enjoyer I was very sympathetic of strong effective government. My life has been pretty cozy thanks to it for the past decades. But after seeing boomers, hypochondriacs, and menopausal women take the reins and use it against healthy people, I&#8217;m fucking done with strong effective government. Fuck that shit, I&#8217;m out. I don&#8217;t want to see strong effective government ever again. I was very lucky that I was out of China in November 2019. It was a fluke really. I moved to the Golden Triangle after that and the law of the jungle was much, much nicer during the Doctors Plague of 2020-2022. But I spent a few months in Europe during the time and man, that was brutal. Not just seeing how retarded governments were; the level of compliance by the people was so disheartening. Imagine being a sincere fascist and seeing your people behave like that. These are my people? My Volk? Am I supposed to sacrifice life and limb for the salus of this populus? Fuck that. Let them cook, they deserve everything that&#8217;s coming to them [...]</p><p>Is there a way to make the body healthy again? I do think so. I think there&#8217;s still place for a successor right wing ideology which is neither Christian fundamentalism or robot worship. And it will happen; but it won&#8217;t happen on Twitter. Maybe it can happen on Urbit, or right here in this site. I have some ideas myself, and I invite you to join me and build this together. </p></blockquote><p>It would be funny if the solution to the paradox Jain highlights was that for every time a COVID lockdown turned a liberal into a conservative, it turned one fascist into a moderate, for a net rightward shift of zero.</p><p><strong>33: </strong>Also from an Argument poll: In a hypothetical Presidential matchup, <a href=\"https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/the-covid-political-backlash-disappeared\">Gavin Newsom beats JD Vance 54-46</a>.

Lactose-intolerant people who drink milk regularly since childhood develop gut microbiota that can digest milk, but which demand an expensive &#8220;tax&#8221; in calories.

Sam Kriss also writes about the situation in <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/the-worlds-first-matcha-labubu-genocide\">The World&#8217;s First Matcha Labubu Genocide</a>, but is unimpressed with Kristof&#8217;s take: </p><blockquote><p>Sudan is passed over in a deeply uncomfortable silence. The absolute most you can do is blame the Emiratis. From what I&#8217;ve seen, more people seem to be appalled at the UAE for its frankly marginal role in arming the RSF than at the RSF itself. This is the approved way of understanding any inscrutably indigenous foreign conflict: you just worm out any third-party involvement and then act like you&#8217;ve solved the whole thing.</p></blockquote><p>I side with Kristof here, for reasons that Sam himself touches on later in his piece, in a section comparing Darfur with Gaza.</p><blockquote><p>It would be very easy to make people care about Darfur again. All it would take is a loud, vocal contingent of RSF apologists in the Western media. </p></blockquote><p>I agree, but would frame it less cynically: the reason Westerners pay attention to Gaza is that there&#8217;s a lever to push: not only does America support Israel, but many of their friends support Israel, so they can imagine convincing America or at least their friends to stop, and at least feel like there is some remote chance of making a small difference (<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce86118q6ego\">and in fact, Trump getting mad at Israel and deciding to pressure them was decisive in effecting the cease-fire</a>). On the other hand, we don&#8217;t have many levers to affect ethnic Baggara in the Rapid Support Forces of Sudan, so it doesn&#8217;t really feel useful to write blog posts arguing that they should stop; <em>obviously</em> they should stop, nobody disagrees with this, and it goes without saying - so nobody says it. But the US does support the UAE, and many of our friends like the UAE or at least go there on vacation, so maybe it&#8217;s possible to have make some small difference by embarrassing them. 4D chess  take is that Sam Kriss agrees with all of this, but &#8220;loudly&#8221; and &#8220;vocally&#8221; argued against it to give people like me a hook to write about this genocide with, in which case I thank him for his sacrifice. It would also be nice to be able to donate, but I don&#8217;t know who to trust in the region - other than <a href=\"https://give.doctorswithoutborders.org/campaign/750532/donate\">Doctors Without Borders</a>, who are usually pretty good.</p><p><strong>47: </strong>The <em>AI Futures Project</em> (group of AI-will-be-fast intellectuals) and the <em>AI As A Normal Technology</em> team (group of AI-will-be-slow intellectuals) wrote <a href=\"https://asteriskmag.substack.com/p/common-ground-between-ai-2027-and\">an adversarial collaboration in Asterisk explaining what they agree on</a>, for example:</p><ul><li><p>That there&#8217;s an important distinction between existing AI and &#8220;strong AGI&#8221;</p></li><li><p>That existing AI is a big deal (&#8220;at least as big a deal as the Internet&#8221;) but will not in and of itself be &#8220;abnormal&#8221;, ie revolutionary outside the distribution of past technologies.</p></li><li><p>That strong AGI <em>would</em> be revolutionary outside this distribution.</p></li><li><p>That &#8220;diffusion of AI into the economy is generally good&#8221;, both because it will have direct benefits and &#8220;also help us learn more about AI, its strengths and weaknesses, its opportunities and risks&#8221;.</p></li><li><p>That governments should be trying to track and understand AI better, and that &#8220;transparency, auditing, and reporting are beneficial&#8221;.</p></li></ul><p>I sometimes do work for AIFP, but I wasn&#8217;t involved in this particular effort. Still, I agree with everything they say - except point 7, &#8220;AIs must not make important decisions or control critical systems&#8221;. Every time you take a Waymo, you&#8217;re letting an AI control a critical system; every time it chooses to stop at a red light but not a green one, it&#8217;s making an &#8220;important decision&#8221; (if you don&#8217;t think this decision is important, consider the consequences of failure). This isn&#8217;t a gotcha: it&#8217;s fine for near-term AI systems to make important decisions in cases where they&#8217;ve been well-tested and there&#8217;s good reason to think that they outperform humans on net.

                "<p>The focus this time around is on the non-academic aspects of primary and secondary school, especially various questions around bullying and discipline, plus an extended rant about someone being wrong on the internet while attacking homeschooling, and the latest on phones.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bullying</h4>\n\n\n<p>If your child is being bullied for real, and it\u2019s getting quite bad, is this an opportunity to learn to stand up for yourself, become tough and other stuff like that?</p>\n<p>Mostly no. Actually fighting back effectively can get you in big trouble, and often models many behaviors you don\u2019t actually want. Whereas the techniques you would use against a real bully outside of school, that you\u2019d want to use, don\u2019t work.</p>\n<div>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-24944\"></span>\n\n\n</div>\n<p>Schools are a special kind of bullying incubator. Once you become the target it is probably not going to get better and might get way worse, and life plausibly becomes a paranoid living hell. If the school won\u2019t stop it, you have to pull the kid. Period.</p>\n<p>If a child has the victim nature, you need to find a highly special next school or pull out of the school system entirely, or else changing schools will not help much for long. You have to try.</p>\n<p>It seems rather obvious, when you point it out, that if you\u2019re going to a place where you\u2019re being routinely attacked and threatened, and this is being tolerated, that the actual adult or brave thing to do is to not to \u2018fight back\u2019 or to \u2018take it on the chin.\u2019 The only move is to not be there.</p>\n<p>In my case, I was lucky that the school where I was bullied went the extra mile and expelled me for being bullied (yes you read that right). At the time I was mad about it, but on reflection I am deeply grateful. It\u2019s way better than doing thing.</p>\n<p>It was years past when sensible parents would have pulled me out, but hey.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/webdevMason/status/1790967534214365550\">Peachy Keenan</a>: I can\u2019t even look at photos of a little boy who killed himself because of \u201csevere bullying\u201d because I get too upset, and I am begging parents: if your child is getting bullied, you need to WALK. You need to GET THEM OUT.</p>\n<p>This is your only job, and you must not fail. Teasing is one thing, but if your child has become the class target, there is no fix except to rescue them at the first sign of trouble.</p>\n<p>Mason: At the heart of this is a widely held but quiet conviction that the regular nastiness a lot of kids put up with is some kind of necessary socialization/character-building process right up until a kid starts falling apart Parents\u2019 frogs are boiled. They should tolerate MUCH less.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is tragic that often getting your child out of there will be very difficult. Our society often does not let you choose your prison on the cheap if the current one involves too much violence. But yeah, at some point you pull them out anyway.

There\u2019s pressure to \u2018keep the suspension rate down,\u2019 so the metric is what gets managed. And they refuse to do anything else meaningful, either.</p>\n<p>Their best teacher, who is the only one bothering to write the student up, gets assigned all the problem cases because she is the best, and is being told to essentially suck it all up, finally is fed up and moves to another school, and the faculty continues falling apart from there.</p>\n<p>Also Mihoda points out that the story includes \u2018while many students are content to play quietly on their phones all period,\u2019 and it turns out phones are totally banned from the classroom but students ignore this and there are no consequences. So it sounds like once you mess up the metrics that badly, there is no way to give the students any meaningful incentives or reasons to change their behaviors. You might as well stop pretending you are running an educational institution rather than a babysitting service.</p>\n<p>The weirdest part of all this is that OP reports the student here could produce work at grade level when he wanted to.

Yes, I am aware there are other items on the list at the link, but I have nothing useful to add about them.</p>\n<p>A very obvious reason to believe you should ban phones is that it is the most elite and intertwined with phones and tech who most want their own kids off of phones.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Paul Schofield: I\u2019d bet that within a decade, wealthy parents will be sending their kids to elite private schools that market themselves as low tech (no phones, screens, AI, etc.) and we\u2019ll end up scrambling to figure out how to make this kind of education available to marginalized students.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/maiamindel/status/1958260411591180502\">Maia:</a> Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s kids have, by his own admission, very limited screen time and no public social media. He sends them to a screen-free school where expert tutors teach small class sizes. Is that because he\u2019s stupid and doesn\u2019t recognize the educational value of his own creations?</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">At Least Ban Phones During Class Seriously What The Hell</h4>\n\n\n<p>At a bare minimum, it seems very obvious that <a href=\"https://x.com/tracewoodgrains/status/1939345656700641648\">letting kids use screens during classes will end poorly</a>? Yet they do it anyway, largely because lectures are such an inefficient delivery mechanism that the kids aren\u2019t motivated enough to notice that they\u2019re giving up what little learning would actually take place otherwise.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Tracing Woods: One of the most important messages of serious education research:</p>\n<p>\u201cstudents are really bad at knowing how learning happens\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/C_Hendrick/status/1939219933398708717\">Carl Hendrick</a>: What happens when you let students manage their own screen time in class? <a href=\"https://t.co/nLQj2f3bfs\">Most don\u2019t, until their grades suffer</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Off-task device use (email, texting, social media) was significantly linked to lower scores on the first exam.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Later in the semester, this relationship weakened, suggesting students may have changed behaviour based on feedback.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Texting is the most common and impactful distraction</p>\n<p>&#8211; this last point (highlighted) is interesting and again points to the fact that students are really bad at knowing how learning happens.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To be fair to the students I suffer from the same problem, where I am tempted by distractions during meetings and television shows and social gatherings and basically constantly. It\u2019s rough.</p>\n<p>Texting in particular seems terrible, because it yanks your attention actively rather than passively, and responding quickly and well has direct obvious implications. If you could somehow ban texting and other things that push, that would probably do a large portion of the work.</p>\n<p>I also would watch out for correlation not being causation. There are obvious reasons why being a poor student or otherwise not likely to learn from a class would cause your device time in that class to rise.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">RCT On Banning Phones</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5370727\">There is another recent RCT</a> on banning smartphones. Grades only increased by 0.086 standard deviations. If that\u2019s all this was, then yeah it\u2019s a nothingburger. Note these other results from the abstract:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Importantly, students exposed to the ban were substantially more supportive of phone-use restrictions, perceiving greater benefits from these policies and displaying reduced preferences for unrestricted access. This enhanced student receptivity to restrictive digital policies may create a self-reinforcing cycle, where positive firsthand experiences strengthen support for continued implementation.</p>\n<p>Despite a mild rise in reported fear of missing out, there were no significant changes in overall student well-being, academic motivation, digital usage, or experiences of online harassment. Random classroom spot checks revealed fewer instances of student chatter and disruptive behaviors, along with reduced phone usage and increased engagement among teachers in phone-ban classrooms, suggesting a classroom environment more conducive to learning.</p>\n<p>Context (in the comments): From the paper: \u201cFor example, the difference between having an average teacher and a very good teacher for one academic year is roughly 0.20 SD \u2013 an effect size that is considered large\u201d. This was a one-semester intervention.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If students habitually checking their phones and being on their phones during class, resulting also in less chatter and disruptive behavior, mattered so little that its impact on learning could be well-measured by a one time 0.086 standard deviations in grades, then why are students in classes at all?</p>\n<p>This is a completely serious question. Either classes do something or they don\u2019t. Either we should make kids go to schools and pay attention or we shouldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>The comments here, all of them, assert that banning phones is important, overdetermined and rather obvious. They\u2019re right, and it\u2019s crazy that this kind of support does not then result in phones being banned more consistently.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hank (in the comments at MR): We recently removed our 12 year old son\u2019s cell phone privileges indefinitely to improve focus on school work and due to shoddy listening at home. After two weeks, I can report:</p>\n<p>&#8211; significantly improved focus *and patience* when doing homework. With the siren song of the phone gone, he is better able to just sit and focus on immediate tasks.</p>\n<p>&#8211; much better two-way communication between parents and child, as opposed to absent-minded half answers we got when cell phone was present.</p>\n<p>&#8211; big increase in time spent outside playing with neighborhood kids.</p>\n<p>&#8211; more time simply spent thinking. When he\u2019s not engaged elsewhere, he lays on the porch, presumably processing his day or just thinking big thoughts.</p>\n<p>&#8211; more offers to help the household run, like walk dog.</p>\n<p>&#8211; more questions for us about our day and what we do in our jobs. this rarely happened before.</p>\n<p>We did not know what to expect, but I don\u2019t need a study to know it\u2019s the best decision we made for our child all year.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The obvious way to explain this is that grades are effectively on curves. When you ban phones the curve moves up, and it looks like you don\u2019t see much improvement.</p>\n<p>The opposite is also possible, Claude points out that teacher perceptions could be causing higher grades, since we don\u2019t see changes in self-reported perceived learning or academic motivation.</p>\n<p>I would still bet on this being an undercount.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/TetraspaceWest/status/1958306639187972456\">Parents are often the ones pushing back</a> against phone bans in schools, because parents want to constantly surveil and text their kids, and many care more about that than whether the kids learn.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Himbo President: I never want to step</p>\n<p>Matthew Zeitlin: teachers are truly braver than the troops, i don\u2019t understand how anyone does the job anymore</p>\n<p>Tetraspace: I do want to step on parents\u2019 toes and consider \u201cparents want to surveil their kids\u201d a point that cuts against allowing phones in schools (though dominated by student preferences)</p>\n<p>Mostly the good argument for and against is \u201cstudents want to coordinate on a no-phones equilibrium but being one a few that don\u2019t use their phones means you miss out, so make school a phones tsar\u201d vs. \u201cmaybe not all students, though, so let them organize that among themselves.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ZekeEmanuel/status/1958525568883778017\">One teacher banned phones in her classroom, reported vastly improved results</a> including universally better student feedback.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/09/from-the-comments-39.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=from-the-comments-39\">Tyler Cowen attempts to elevate Frank</a> from the comments to argue for phones, saying taking away phones \u2018hurt his best students,\u2019 and adds that without phones how can you teach AI? I have never seen a comments section this savage, either in the content or in the associated voting, starting with the post asking him to prove his claim to be a teacher (which he does not do).</p>\n<p>Most of all, it was this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Lizard Man: All of these seem like arguments against school, not arguments for phones.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you think that the smartest students are hurt because they should be on their phones instead of in class, okay, well, why are they in class?</p>\n<p>If you say you cannot possibly learn AI without a phone, one has three responses.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Have you not heard of computers?</li>\n<li>In the middle of any given class?</li>\n<li>Do you think what the students are doing with their phones is learning?\n<ol>\n<li>Pretty obviously this is not what is happening. No one reports this ever.</li>\n<li>If they somehow are doing this, are they complementing what\u2019s in the class, or are they substituting for it? Again, what are you even doing?</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Can I imagine a world in which phones benefit students because they are asking the AI complementary questions during classes the way Tyler would use one? Sure. There presumably exist some such students. But to argue against banning phones you have to effectively make an argument against requiring school in current form.</p>\n<p>The argument \u2018some kids have no one to talk to and taking away their phone is cruel\u2019 is even stupider. First, if a kid has no one physically there to talk to ever, that\u2019s a different huge failure, and again why does this person go to school, but also shouldn\u2019t they be learning during the school day not chatting with buddies via text? We really think it\u2019s a depravation to live like everyone used to until after the final bell?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/robinhanson/status/1980284227116495252\">A new study shows</a> <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w34388\">substantial impacts from an in-school cellphone ban</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>David Figlio &amp; Umut Ozek: Cellphone bans in schools have become a popular policy in recent years in the United States, yet very little is known about their effects on student outcomes.</p>\n<p>In this study, we try to fill this gap by examining the causal effects of bans on student test scores, suspensions, and absences using detailed student-level data from Florida and a quasi-experimental research strategy relying upon differences in pre-ban cellphone use by students, as measured by building-level Advan data. Several important findings emerge.</p>\n<p>First, we show that the enforcement of cellphone bans in schools led to a significant increase in student suspensions in the short-term, especially among Black students, but disciplinary actions began to dissipate after the first year, potentially suggesting a new steady state after an initial adjustment period.</p>\n<p>Second, we find significant improvements in student test scores in the second year of the ban after that initial adjustment period.</p>\n<p>Third, the findings suggest that cellphone bans in schools significantly reduce student unexcused absences, an effect that may explain a large fraction of the test score gains. The effects of cellphone bans are more pronounced in middle and high school settings where student smartphone ownership is more common.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The proposed mechanism for absences seems to be that cellphones were previously used to coordinate or plan absences, which the students could no longer do. The adjustment period, before which suspensions are a problem, makes sense, and also helps explain some of the negative results elsewhere. Alternatively, students might see school as less pointless.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Look What You Made Me Do</h4>\n\n\n<p>Another story: <a href=\"https://reason.com/2024/05/07/this-student-was-allegedly-suspended-for-saying-illegal-aliens-did-that-violate-the-first-amendment/\">Student suspended for three days for saying \u2018illegal alien,</a>\u2019 in the context of asking for clarification on vocabulary, potentially endangering an athletic scholarship:</p>\n<blockquote><p>During an April English lesson, McGhee says he sought clarification on a vocabulary word: aliens. \u201cLike space aliens,\u201d he asked, \u201cor illegal aliens without green cards?\u201d In response, a Hispanic student\u2014another minor whom the lawsuit references under the pseudonym \u201cR.\u201d\u2014reportedly joked that he would \u201ckick [McGhee\u2019s] ass.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>This was Reason magazine, so they focus on whether this was constitutional. I\u2019d prefer to ask whether this is was a reasonable thing to do, which it obviously isn\u2019t given the context.</p>\n<p>On the law, it seems schools can punish \u2018potentially disruptive conduct.\u2019</p>\n<p>So that means that if other students could respond by being disruptive, than that can be put on you, whether or not that response is reasonable.</p>\n<p>Thus, punishing people who get bullied for causing a disturbance. If they weren\u2019t asking for it then the bullies wouldn\u2019t be going around being disruptive. This is remarkably common, and also was a large portion of my actual childhood.</p>\n<p>This is then amplified by the problem that many actual disruptors care a lot less about punishment than others with more at stake, and in many cases they even get a full pass anyway, so the opportunities for asymmetrical warfare are everywhere.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">DEI</h4>\n\n\n<p>One must deal with what is taught and done in practice, not in theory.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/samhaselby/status/1917888623875117385\">So if this pyramid</a> is being used in the Harvard School of Education, and it straight up lists \u201cFree Trade\u201d as part of a \u201cPyramid of White Supremacy\u201d in the same category as literally \u201cSlavery\u201d then, well, there is that.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mwbg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7078fab2-f051-44fb-b5fe-5e8baf3a0ca4_812x1066.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Equity Consultants</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/kane/status/1978505249833808288\">I wish this was more of a scam, the actual events are so much worse than that</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Kane: I finally got the public records request back.</p>\n<p>SF Public Schools (@SFUnified) paid $182,000 to a consultant, while already in a deficit, to implement \u201cgrading for equity\u201d.</p>\n<p>The advice: make 41% a passing grade, and stop grading homework.</p>\n<p>Equity achieved.</p>\n<p>Our public schools @SFUnified agreed to pay the \u201cequity consultant\u201d $380/hr plus $14,800 in expenses.</p>\n<p>In the emails to @SFUnified, the \u201cequity consultant\u201d was bragging that after \u201cequity\u201d training, teachers would not count tardiness nor penalize not doing homework at all.</p>\n<p>This is what our public schools are wasting taxes on. <a href=\"https://t.co/kMVtA9gdVV\">Here are all &gt;120 pages of emails and invoices</a> regarding @SFUnified deciding to waste taxes on \u201cequity\u201d consultants and blow up the deficit even more.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rules Are Rules</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/diviacaroline/status/1804208067380416557\">As a parent, school or anyone else, you need help from others to make your rules stick</a>.

You\u2019re basically fine if you can then catch up rather than being lost, but if you\u2019re lost then you\u2019re basically screwed and there aren\u2019t graceful fallback options.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Education Labor Theory of Value</h4>\n\n\n<p>The eternal question: Are you trying to learn or to avoid (working at) learning?</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://arnoldkling.substack.com/p/education-links-5232025\">Arnold Kling</a>: I observed that over the years that I taught AP statistics, the better I got at explaining, the worse I got at teaching. It was better for students if I stumbled, back-tracked, or used a more challenging way to demonstrate a proposition than if I did so quickly and efficiently. I see this also in Israeli dancing, where the more mistakes that the teacher makes and has to correct, the better is my memory for the dance.</p>\n<p>Learning requires work. When the teacher stumbles, that can force the student to work harder. This relates to AI, because AI can allow students to get away with less work. This appeals to students, but it does not help them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you are \u2018better at explaining,\u2019 but your explanations work less well? Skill Issue! Obviously that means you are not in fact explaining better. You are \u2018hiding your chain of thought (CoT),\u2019 and that CoT was doing work. The explanations are getting worse.</p>\n<p>If mistakes are helpful, you can make actual mistakes, or you can demonstrate mistakes. As one karate sensei I had would often say, \u2018bad example,\u2019 then he do the move wrong. One could argue that it is very hard to \u2018get the errors right\u2019 if they are not real, but I would argue the opposite, that if they are real they are kind of random and if you plan them then you can pick the most effective ones. But it\u2019s easy to fool yourself into thinking the mistakes are dead weight, so random will often be better than none at all.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Wrong on the Internet Including About Home School</h4>\n\n\n<p>I have a policy of trying very hard not highlighting people who are Wrong on the Internet. But when sufficient virality attaches (e.g. 10 million or more views) we get to have a little fun. You can safely skip this section if you already know all this.</p>\n<p>I just want it as a reference for later to point out such people really exist and also writing it helped vent some rage.</p>\n<p>So here is \u2018Knowing Better,\u2019 who not only does now know better, but who has some very\u2026 interesting ideas about human children.</p>\n<p>This is what opponents of home schooling so often sound like. Is it a strawman? <a href=\"https://x.com/KnowingBetterYT/status/1878934361682436549\">If so, it was a rather prominent one, and I keep seeing variations on it.</a></p>\n<p>People really do make versions of all of these rage-inducing, frankly evil arguments, on a continuous basis.</p>\n<p>This thread gives us an opportunity to find them in their purest forms, and provide the oversupply of obvious counterarguments.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Luke: Homeschooling. Shouldn\u2019t. Be. An. Option.</p>\n<p>Possum Reviews: Is there even one realistic and compelling argument against homeschooling, considering all of the data shows homeschooled kids do better than public school kids in just about all theaters of life? I\u2019m giving you anti-homeschooling people the benefit of the doubt that there\u2019s more to it than just wanting Big Brother to control all of the information and narratives kids are exposed to for the purposes of indoctrination.</p>\n<p>Knowing Better: I get flak every time I say this, so I figured I should clarify.</p>\n<p>Universally, 100% of the time, homeschooling is the worst option for every single child. Without exception.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not being hyperbolic.</p>\n<p>Let me explain.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqQRg74HGo4&amp;pp=ygUPbm93IGhlYXIgbWUgb3V0\">Now hear me out</a>!</p>\n<blockquote><p>Knowing Better: No person on earth is qualified to teach every subject at every grade level. Having a textbook isn\u2019t enough.</p>\n<p>Teachers are supposed to know more than what is in the book so they can answer questions about the book.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Emphasis on \u2018supposed to,\u2019 this often is not the case. Some teachers are magic, but the title doesn\u2019t make them so, especially given they need to deal with 20:1 student:teacher ratios or higher much of the time, whereas you can do 4:1 or 1:1 a lot.</p>\n<p>But also we are talking about (mostly) elementary school subjects, not \u2018every subject at every grade level.\u2019</p>\n<p>Yes, I think I am very qualified to teach \u2018every subject\u2019 at (for example) a 5th grade level other than foreign languages. I am smarter than a fifth grader. To the extent I don\u2019t know the things, I can learn the things faster than I teach them. You can just [learn, or do, or teach] things. And that\u2019s even without AI.</p>\n<p>The medical school motto is \u2018see one, do one, teach one.\u2019 A powerful mantra.</p>\n<p>The math team in high school literally said hey, you\u2019re our 6th best senior and there\u2019s overflow, you\u2019re a captain now, go teach a class, good luck. And it was fine.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/KelseyTuoc/status/1879304771154415807\">Or similarly</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Kelsey Piper: My sophomore year of high school my calculus class got assigned a math teacher who didn\u2019t actually know calculus so he just kind of found the smart kid and told him to teach the class. It was fine tbh, but if you\u2019re gonna posture about this you have to have qualified teachers.</p>\n<p>He went to MIT for undergrad and then got a bio PhD. honestly I was probably receiving very high quality math instruction, just not from a Qualified Teacher TM</p>\n<p>The real situation is that public schools vary a lot in how good the teachers are and parents also vary a lot in how good they are at teaching and so sometimes homeschooling results in an increase in how much kids learn and sometimes a decrease.</p>\n<p>But some people rather than have this conversation just blindly insist that all public school educators are super-genius super-experts doing some incredibly sophisticated thing. And this is alienating to parents and students because we can see it\u2019s not true.</p>\n<p>Dave Kasten: A big weakness of this particular anti-homeschooling argument is that it\u2019s supposed to be persuading policy elites, who by default are extremely likely to think that they\u2019re capable of generically doing any task up to AP exams.</p>\n<p>Kelsey Piper: and who are basically correct about this imo, it\u2019s not that hard.</p>\n<p>Patrick McKenzie: I could get behind a compromise: a) Mandatory annual testing for homeschool students and anyone below 10th percentile ordered to attend public school. b) Any public school teachers whose class below 10th percentile identified as Would Have Been Fired If They Were Homeschoolers:</p>\n<p>Of course that is not a serious policy proposal, because it contemplates making public school employees accountable for results in any fashion whatsoever, but a geek can dream.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/KelseyTuoc/status/1879654945601081696\">Kelsey Piper</a>: We run a very small very low budget co-op/microschool and we keep getting kids from public school who can\u2019t read. They learn how at a normal pace once you teach them. They just weren\u2019t taught.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To the extent I can\u2019t learn the things and don\u2019t know the things\u2026 well, in this context I don\u2019t actually care because obviously those things aren\u2019t so important.</p>\n<p>But also, home schooling does not mean I have to know and teach every subject as one person? There is a second part. There are friends. There are tutors, and even multiple full day s per week of private tutoring costs less than private school tuition around here. There are online courses. There are books. There is AI, which basically is qualified to teach everything up through undergraduate level. And so on.</p>\n<p>For foreign languages, if one wants to learn those, standard classes are beyond atrocious. If you\u2019re ahead of class you learn almost nothing. If you\u2019re behind, you die, and never catch up. There are much, much better options. And it\u2019s a great illustration of choice &#8211; you can teach them whatever second language you happen to know.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Knowing Better: Even then, you need to know when to teach what concepts.</p>\n<p>Teachers are basically experts in child development.</p>\n<p>Kids physically can\u2019t understand negative numbers until a certain age. The abstract thinking parts of their brain aren\u2019t done cooking yet. Do you know what age that is?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/politicalmath/status/1879199976682889615\">Polimath</a>: This whole thread is kind of terrible, but this part of it is just about perfect because teachers are not experts in child development and the idea that kids *physically* can\u2019t understand negative numbers before a certain age is so wrong it is funny.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I really want the answer here to be a negative number. Unfortunately it\u2019s not, but also there obviously isn\u2019t a fixed number, also often this number is, like, four. Come on.</p>\n<p>But actually, in a side thread, we find out he thinks the answer is\u2026 wait for it\u2026 12.</p>\n<p>My oldest son is ten. He\u2019s been working with negative numbers for years. If he hadn\u2019t, I\u2019d be very, very worried about him. Don\u2019t even ask what math I was doing at 12.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Knowing Better: The OP was saying I\u2019m wrong about kids not understanding negative numbers until a certain age.</p>\n<p>I know it\u2019s 12 and I know it\u2019s easy to look up. He didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>So I gave him another example of something that develops later, and you looked up the age as if it disproves my point.</p>\n<p>Perry Metzger: I was doing algebra long before I was twelve. I did proofs long before I was 12. You think I didn\u2019t understand negative numbers? I can introduce you to literally hundreds of children below the age of 12 who understand negative numbers.</p>\n<p>Andrew Rettek: My six year old has been doing math problems with negative numbers for months at least.</p>\n<p>Delen Heisman: I\u2019m sorry but your kid lied to you about his age, he\u2019s gotta be at least 12.</p>\n<p>Eliza: When I was in 4th grade, I took a test intended for eighth graders which had oddities like \u201c4x+3=11\u201d, but it seemed obvious to me that the x meant \u201ctimes what?\u201d without ever having learned algebra. Not understanding negatives by 12? bonkers!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/gallabytes/status/1879682912389582911\">Gallabytes</a>: a friend of mine published in number theory at 11.</p>\n<p>Jessica Taylor: utterly absurd views disprovable through methods like \u201cremembering what it was like to be a kid\u201d or \u201ctalking with 10 year olds.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelblume/status/1879952723552133628\">Mike Blume:</a> This man is a child development expert who knows incontrovertible child development facts, like that children under twelve can\u2019t understand negative numbers.</p>\n<p>My eight year old is going to find this hilarious when she wakes up.</p>\n<p>(can confirm, she laughed her little head off)</p></blockquote>\n<p>That\u2019s the thing. Arguments against home schooling almost never would survive contact with the enemy, and by \u2018the enemy\u2019 I mean actual children.</p>\n<p>Anyway, back to the main thread.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Knowing Better: But let\u2019s say you decide to do it anyway, because you want your child to have a religious education.</p>\n<p>Your child needs to be exposed to different ideas and people who don\u2019t look like them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s going to happen eventually, better for it to happen now while you\u2019re able to explain why you believe what you do.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The universal form of this argument, which will be repeated several times here, is \u2018if bad things [from your perspective] will happen in the future, better that similar bad things happen now.\u2019</p>\n<p>The argument here is patently absurd &#8211; that if you send your child to a secular school, they are less likely to end up religious than if you send them to a religious school. Or that if you expose kids to anti-[X] pro-[Y] arguments and have them spend all day in a culture that is anti-[X] and pro-[Y] and rewards them on that basis, that this won\u2019t move them on net from [X] towards [Y].</p>\n<p>I also am so sick of \u2018your kid needs \u2018socialization\u2019 or to be around exactly the right type and number of other children or else horrible things will happen, so you should spend five figures a year and take up the majority of their lives to ensure this. Which is totally, very practically, a thing people constantly say.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;Your child is a genius.</p>\n<p>They may be ahead of the class, but they won\u2019t learn how to work with others and help them catch up.</p>\n<p>That isn\u2019t your child\u2019s job, of course, but it will be an invaluable skill going forward. Want them to be a leader some day?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Kind of sounds like you want to make it their job. Yes, the entire philosophy is that if your child falls behind, it is bad for them. But if they somehow get ahead, that is also not good, and potentially even worse. Instead they should spend their time learning to\u2026 help others \u2018catch up\u2019 to them, also known as teaching?</p>\n<p>As for \u2018learning to work with others\u2019 this is such a scam way of trying to enslave my kid to do your work for you, I can\u2019t even.</p>\n<p>If you want your child to be a leader, fine, teach them leadership skills. You think the best way to do that is have them in a classroom where the teacher is going over things they already know? Or enlisting them to each other kids? How does that work?</p>\n<blockquote><p>You know those prodigies who end up in college at 16? What kind of experience do you think they\u2019re having?</p>\n<p>Absolutely zero college kids &#8211; sorry, adults &#8211; will want to hang around a 16 year old for reasons that I hope are obvious.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is completely false. Adults very much want to hang out with bright eager 16 year olds, reports a former bright eager 16 year old. Yes, they won\u2019t want to hang out to do certain things, but that\u2019s because they\u2019re illegal or they think you\u2019re not ready. So, as William Eden points out, you can just\u2026 not tell them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Let your kid grow up like everyone else.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019ve seen everyone else. No.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;Your child has been bullied.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m sure it\u2019s safer at home. Is that your plan for the rest of their childhood?</p>\n<p>Getting the school to fix the situation, or switching schools, or hell, paying the popular kids to protect your child, is still better than keeping them at home.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Do you even hear yourself? Schools are a place where violence and a lot of property crime, and most forms of verbal bullying are de facto legal. And you are saying that you can\u2019t respond with exit. Paying the popular kids to protect your child? What universe do you live in? Does that ever, ever work? Do you have any idea what would happen in most cases if you tried, how much worse things would get?</p>\n<p>Yes, of course you can try to \u2018get the school to fix the situation\u2019 but they mostly won\u2019t. And switching schools may or may not be a practical option, and probably results in the same problem happening again for the same reasons. If kids sense you\u2019re the type to be bullied, they\u2019ll bully you anywhere, because we create the conditions for that.</p>\n<blockquote><p>As a parent, it is not your job to curate your child\u2019s entire existence and decide what ideas they hear or who they socialize with.</p>\n<p>They will grow up and resent you for it.</p>\n<p>Your job is to guide them and provide context to what they\u2019re experiencing outside of your presence.</p></blockquote>\n<p>No, parent, deciding how to raise your kids and what they get exposed to isn\u2019t your job, f*** you, that\u2019s the state\u2019s job, via the schools, except they are optimizing for things you actively hate, and also mostly whatever is convenient for them and their requirements. And who said you are \u2018deciding what ideas they hear or who they socialize with\u2019 here anyway?</p>\n<p>In school, the kid is exposed to whatever the state decides. The kid has basically zero say until high school and very little until college. At home, the kids has lots of say. Because they can talk to you, and you can respond. Same with who they hang out with &#8211; they\u2019re not forced to spend all day with a randomly assigned class, nor are you suddenly forced to dictate who their friends are.</p>\n<p>He doubles down downthread on it being a bad thing if you curate your child\u2019s experiences, and try as a parent to ensure the best for them (while also doubling down that most home school parents don\u2019t do this). Sorry, what?</p>\n<blockquote><p>When it comes to stats like \u201chomeschooled kids perform better on tests,\u201d there\u2019s a selection bias problem.</p>\n<p>Every public school kid takes tests like the SAT or ACT. Only the college-bound homeschool kids do.</p>\n<p>Parents decide the curriculum. There is no homeschool diploma.</p>\n<p>The idea of a tradwife teaching her 8 blonde kids in a farmhouse is the EXCEPTION when it comes to homeschool.</p>\n<p>More often than not, homeschool is a dumping ground for kids who have failed out of or been expelled from everywhere else. It\u2019s a dead end to their education.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You got to love the adverse selection argument followed right away by \u2018it\u2019s mostly a dumping ground for expelled kids.\u2019 And also the whole \u2018you shouldn\u2019t choose this for your child\u2019 with the (completely false) claim that most such children got expelled, so they don\u2019t have much choice. It contradicts the entire narrative above, all of it.</p>\n<p>As for the argument on tests, well, we can obviously adjust for that in various ways.</p>\n<p>There is of course also a class of people who say they are \u2018homeschooling\u2019 and instead are \u2018home not schooling\u2019 where the kids hang out without any effort to teach them. That\u2019s often going to be not great, and you should check, but that\u2019s what the tests are for. And others will spend a bunch of focus on cultural aspects (or what some would call indoctrination), just like regular school does, and some will take that too far. But again, that\u2019s what the tests are for.</p>\n<p>For final thoughts on homeschooling this time, I\u2019m turning this over to Kelsey:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/KelseyTuoc/status/1945526738886509033\">Kelsey Piper</a>: Homeschooling is one of those things where the people who do it have generally made it one of the major focuses of their life and put thousands of hours of thought into it &#8211; which curriculum to use, which philosophy/approach, which tests and camps and resources, etc</p>\n<p>which makes the tossed-off contributions of people who have given homeschooling about 5 hours of thought in their lives particularly maddening. Now, this dynamic shows up in other contexts and doesn\u2019t always mean that the people who do something full time are right!</p>\n<p>But the odds that a criticism that you came up with after having thought about homeschooling on and off when you see a tweet about it will resonate, be useful, be meaningful or even be literally true are just not good.</p>\n<p>\u2018you\u2019re not qualified to teach your kids\u2019 I\u2019m familiar both with the large scale literature on homeschool outcomes and on the actual test scores of the homeschooled/alt-schooled kids I know. There just isn\u2019t a productive conversation to be had here until you acknowledge that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So I guess what we\u2019re really trying to say here is\u2026</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You Cannot Defer To Experts In A World Like This</h4>\n\n\n<p>I mean this universally, not only regarding children or education.</p>\n<p>The entire educational \u2018expert\u2019 class very obviously is engaged in enemy action. They are very obviously trying to actively prevent your children from learning, and trying to damage everyone\u2019s families and experiences of childhood, in ways that are impossible to ignore. And they are using their positions to mobilize the state to impose their interventions by force, in the face of overwhelming opposition, in one of the most important aspects of life.</p>\n<p>If that is true, then the procedure \u2018find the people who are labeled as experts and defer to them\u2019 cannot be a good procedure, in general, for understanding the world and making life decisions. If you want to defer to opinions of others, you need to do a much better job than this of figuring out which others can be safely deferred to.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Lighter Side</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/MegaChanRevival/status/1876397404578099435\">MegaChan: THE PAGE.</a></p></blockquote>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Tv4g!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bde5954-5c40-43fb-a14a-dc864b586b1d_1317x2048.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/peterwildeford/status/1908158867583955432\">Extra credit.</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>Peter Wildeford: Lots of news articles out there about how students are dumb, but then there\u2019s this.</p>\n<p>Polycarp: An answer I received from a student on my most recent test [#8 is B btw]</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ns7T!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64ea417c-b4ff-4d71-87fa-e98d246852f1_1200x900.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/FrTotleben92742/status/1912137215276089471\">Credit where credit is due.</a></p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sWwe!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F099b14ef-3016-47f1-8f1b-1ab1b0e7ca92_960x1200.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<blockquote><p>Albert Gustafson: Same energy.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AvAQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac275ddf-10d8-4020-95c0-dc96305f8577_278x180.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</blockquote>"
