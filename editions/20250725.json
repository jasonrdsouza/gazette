That signing up for an educational quest into <a href=\"https://omarchy.org\">Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/lisatomic5/status/1344346004900835330\">history</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Inquiry-ebook/dp/B0026772N8/\">motorcycle repair</a> actually is an incredibly effective alternative to therapy! At least for men who'd prefer to feel useful over being listened to, which, in my experience, is most of them.</div><div><br />This is why I find it so misguided when people who undertake those quests sell their journey short with self-effacing jibes about how much <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmemes/comments/7m11g8/average_arch_linux_user_oh_and_did_you_know_that/\">an unattractive nerd</a> it makes them to care about their hobby. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi detailed back in 1990 how peak human happiness arrives exactly in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202/\">these moments of flow</a> when your competence is stretched by a difficult-but-doable challenge. Don't tell me those endorphins don't also help counter the darkness.</div><div><br />But it's just as much about the fact that these pursuits of competence usually offer a great opportunity for community as well that seals the deal. I've found time and again that people are starved for the kind of <a href=\"https://x.com/dhh/status/1947681059988017417\">topic-based connections</a> that, say, learning about Linux offers in spades. You're not just learning, you're learning with others.<br /><br /></div><div>That is a time-tested antidote to depression: Forming and cultivating meaningful human connections. Yes, doing so over the internet isn't as powerful as doing it in person, but it's still powerful. It still offers community, involvement, and plenty of invitation to <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-responsibility-is-the-reward-69e5b73f\">carry a meaningful burden</a>.</div><div><br />Open source nails this trifecta of motivations to a T. There are endless paths of discovery and mastery available. There are tons of <a href=\"https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/\">fellow travelers</a> with whom to connect and collaborate. And you'll find an unlimited number of meaningful burdens in maintainerships open for the taking.</div><div><br />So next time you see that meme, you should cheer that the talk therapy table is empty. Leave it available for the severe, pathological cases that exercise and the pursuit of competence can't cure. Most people just don't need therapy, they need purpose, they need competence, they need exercise, and they need community.</div>\n</div>"

I've given it similar time and similar thought.<br /><br />But then I step outside tech for a moment, ground myself in other professions, and realize how odd it would be to ask the same kind of question to a knife maker. \"Hey master bladesmith, you\u2019ve made a dozen knives this year. Same as last year. Same as the last 20. If you love metal so much, why not help build a battleship? Think of all that metal!\"<br /><br />Or a cabinet maker. \"Hey, ok I get it \u2014 you take raw wood and you turn it into beautiful furniture. Again and again and again. Don't you think a wood addict like you should consider getting into forestry? Imagine!\"<br /><br />That would be a ridiculous line of questioning. So why is it persuasive in tech?<br /><br />I think part of it is that we're talking about software. An endlessly malleable medium that can truly be anything. With no conceptual limits, it\u2019s easy to think you should keep expanding. But why?<br /><br />There's nothing at all wrong with honing in, developing your craft, making variations of things you're good at, and getting better each time. Nothing small about it. Nothing unfulfilling about it.<br /><br />So instead of looking sideways at what others are building \u2014 or upward toward the mythical \u201cnext level\u201d \u2014 we focus ahead on what we're good at. We like to make useful, straightforward things we need. Specific tools and familiar ingredients combined in different ratios, different molds, for different purposes. Like a baker working from the same tight set of pantry ingredients to make a hundred distinct recipes. You wouldn't turn to them and say \"enough with the butter, flour, sugar, baking powder, and eggs already!\"<br /><br />Getting the same few things right in different ways is a career's worth of work.<br /><br /></div><div>-Jason</div>\n</div>"
