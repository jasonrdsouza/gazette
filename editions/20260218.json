We did our best, but now, with the clarity of hindsight, it\u2019s easy to see all the ways the ground was shifting under us as we wrote.</p>\n<p>When we started the book in 2018, Honeycomb was the only observability company, and our definition of observability\u2014high cardinality, high dimensionality, explorability\u2014was the only definition. By the time the book came out in 2021, everyone was rebranding their products as observability, Gartner had waded into the fray.. it was a mess.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the mature thing to do would be to have gone back and rewritten the book in light of the evolving market definition. But while I won\u2019t speak for my co-authors, after 3.5 years, I was pretty fucking desperate to be done.</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset can-restack\">\n<source type=\"image/webp\" />\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 534px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"362\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/substackcdn.com/image/fetch/%24s_%21PfU9%21%2Cw_1456%2Cc_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cq_auto%3Agood%2Cfl_progressive%3Asteep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a31b632-1d2b-4034-95b2-beb8f6bfdf23_604x391.png?resize=534%2C362&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"534\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Artist\u2019s rendering of the traditional authorial glow of pride, joy and deep satisfaction upon completing any book manuscript</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>I swore I would never go through that again.

Number one, it absolutely needed to be written; number two, I definitely wanted to help write it.</p>\n<p>SO MUCH has changed. SO MUCH needs saying. When we met up in June to pull together a new outline, it seemed to just flow out of us.</p>\n<p>A few of the many things that were not at all clear in 2018, but are crystal clear today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Who we are writing for</strong>\u00a0(software engineers)</li>\n<li><strong>What they are doing</strong>\u00a0(instrumenting their code and analyzing it in production, with and without AI)</li>\n<li><strong>What observability means to analysts and the market at large</strong>\u00a0(literally anything to do with software telemetry)</li>\n<li>The integrations game is over, and\u00a0<strong>OpenTelemetry has won</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Most companies still don\u2019t have real observability</strong>. And they don\u2019t know it. \ud83d\ude15</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am excited and incredibly grateful for the opportunity to take a second whack at this book in the era of AI.

Until a few months ago, for the vast majority of people, &#8220;using AI&#8221; meant talking to a chatbot in a back-and-forth conversation. But over the past few months, it has become practical to use AI as an agent: you can assign them to a task and they do them, using tools as appropriate. Because of this change, you have to consider three things when deciding what AI to use: Models, Apps, and Harnesses.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0VjC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59cd7383-bdba-4322-8714-006f0157e0e1_4582x1337.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"425\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0VjC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59cd7383-bdba-4322-8714-006f0157e0e1_4582x1337.png\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">The exact same model, Claude Opus 4.6, asked the exact same question, &#8220;Compare ChatGPT and Claude and Gemini&#8221; in three different apps and harnesses.

These are what determine how smart the system is, how well it reasons, how good it is at writing or coding or analyzing a spreadsheet, and how well it can see images or create them. Models are what the benchmarks measure and what the AI companies race to improve. When people say &#8220;Claude is better at writing&#8221; or &#8220;ChatGPT is better at math,&#8221; they&#8217;re talking about models.</p><p><strong>Apps</strong> are the products you actually use to talk to a model, and which let models do real work for you. The most common app is the website for each of these models: chatgpt.com, claude.ai, gemini.google.com (or else their equivalent application on your phone). Increasingly, there are other apps made by each of these AI companies as well, including coding tools like OpenAI Codex or <a href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/claude-code-and-what-comes-next\">Claude Code,</a> and desktop tools like Claude Cowork. </p><p><strong>Harnesses</strong> are what let the power of AI models do real work, like a horse harness takes the raw power of the horse and lets it pull a cart or plow. A harness is a system that lets the AI use tools, take actions, and complete multi-step tasks on its own. Apps come with a harness. Claude on the website has a harness that lets Claude 4.6 Opus do web searches and write code but also has instructions about how to approach various problems like creating spreadsheets or doing graphic design work. Claude Code has an even more extensive harness: it gives Claude 4.6 Opus a virtual computer, a web browser, a code terminal, and the ability to string these together to actually do stuff like researching, building, and testing your new website from scratch. Manus (recently acquired by Meta) was essentially a standalone harness that could wrap around multiple models. OpenClaw, which made big news recently, is mostly a harness that allows you to use any AI model locally on your computer. </p><p>Until recently, you didn&#8217;t have to know this. The model <em>was</em> the product, the app was the website, and the harness was minimal. You typed, it responded, you typed again. Now the same model can behave very differently depending on what harness it&#8217;s operating in. Claude Opus 4.6 talking to you in a chat window is a very different experience from Claude Opus 4.6 operating inside Claude Code, autonomously writing and testing software for hours at a stretch. GPT-5.2 answering a question is a very different experience from GPT-5.2 Thinking navigating websites and building you a slide deck.</p><p>It means that the question &#8220;which AI should I use?&#8221; has gotten harder to answer, because the answer now depends on what you&#8217;re trying to do with it. So let me walk through the landscape.</p><h2>The Models Right Now</h2><p>The top models are remarkably close in overall capability and are generally &#8220;smarter&#8221; and make fewer errors than ever. But, if you want to use an advanced AI seriously, you&#8217;ll need to pay at least $20 a month (though some areas of the world have alternate plans that charge less). Those $20 get you two things: a choice of which model to use and the ability to use the more advanced frontier models and apps. I wish I could tell you the free models currently available are as good as the paid models, but they are not. The free models are all optimized for chat, rather than accuracy, so they are very fast and often more fun to talk to, but much less accurate and capable. Often, when someone posts an example of an AI doing something stupid, it is because they are either using the free models or because they have not selected a smarter model to work with.</p><p>The big three frontier models are <a href=\"https://claude.ai/\">Claude Opus 4.6 </a>from Anthropic, Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https://gemini.google.com/\">Gemini 3.0 Pro</a>, and OpenAI&#8217;s <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/\">ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking</a>. With all of the options, you get access to top-of-the-line AI models with a voice mode, the ability to see images and documents, the ability to execute code, good mobile apps, and the ability to create images and video (Claude lacks here, however). They all have different personalities and strengths and weaknesses, but for most people, just selecting the one they like best will suffice. For now, the other companies in this space have fallen behind, whether in models or in apps and harnesses, though some users may still have reasons for picking them.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uPZ-!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58559981-9fb2-4a07-b3e6-b3d0d73914e8_1205x428.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"428\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uPZ-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58559981-9fb2-4a07-b3e6-b3d0d73914e8_1205x428.png\" width=\"1205\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">This is only a slight exaggeration - for casual chats where being right doesn&#8217;t matter, you can use smaller models, otherwise please pick advanced models!</figcaption></figure></div><p>When you are using any AI app (more on those shortly), including phone apps or websites, <strong>the single most important thing you can do is pick the right model,</strong> which the AI companies do not make easy. If you are just chatting, the default models are fine, if you want to do real work, they are not. For ChatGPT, no matter whether you use the free or pay version, the default model you are given is &#8220;ChatGPT 5.2&#8221;. The issue is that GPT-5.2 is not one model, it is many, from the very weak GPT-5.2 mini to the very good GPT-5.2 Thinking to the extremely powerful GPT-5.2 Pro. When you select GPT-5.2, what you are really getting is &#8220;auto&#8221; mode, where the AI decides which model to use, often a less powerful one. By paying, you get to decide which model to use, and, to further complicate things, you can also select how hard the model &#8220;thinks&#8221; about the answer. For anything complex, I always manually select <strong>GPT-5.2 Thinking Extended</strong> (on the $20 plan) or <strong>GPT-5.2 Thinking Heavy</strong> (on more expensive plans). For a really hard problem that requires a lot of thinking, you can pick GPT-5.2 Pro, the strongest model, which is only available at a higher cost tier.</p><p>For Gemini, there are three options: Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 3 Thinking, and, for some paid plans, 3 Pro. If you pay for the Ultra plan, you get access to Gemini Deep Think for very hard problems (which is in another menu entirely). Always pick <strong>Gemini 3 Pro or Thinking</strong> for any serious problem. For Claude, you need to pick <strong>Opus 4.6</strong> (though the new <strong>Sonnet 4.6 </strong>is also powerful, it is not quite as good) and turn on the &#8220;extended thinking&#8221; switch.</p><p>Again, for most people, the model differences are now small enough that the <em>app </em>and <em>harness</em> matter more than the model. Which brings us to the bigger question.</p><h2>The Chatbot Interfaces</h2><p>The vast majority of people use chatbots, the main websites or mobile apps of ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, to access their AI models. In fact, we can call the chatbot the most important and widespread AI app. In the past few months, these apps have become quite different from each other.</p><p>Some of the differences are which features are bundled with AI:</p><ul><li><p>Bundled into the Gemini chatbot (and accessible with the little plus button): you can access nano banana (the best current AI image creation tool), Veo 3.1 (a leading AI video creation tool), Guided Learning (when trying to study, this helps the AI act more like a tutor), and Deep Research</p></li><li><p>Bundled into ChatGPT is even more of a hodgepodge of options accessible with the plus button. You can Create Images (the image generator is almost as good as nano banana, but you can&#8217;t access the Sora video creator through the chatbot), Study and Learn (the equivalent to Guided Learning in Gemini, but there is also a separate Quizzes creator for some reason), Deep Research and Shopping Research (surprisingly good and overlooked), and a set of other options that most people will not use often, so I won&#8217;t cover here.</p></li><li><p>Claude has only Deep Research as bundled option, but you can access a study mode by creating a Project and selecting study project. </p></li><li><p>All of the AI models let you connect to data, such as letting the AI read your email and calendar, access your files, or connect to other applications. This can make AI far more useful, but, again, each AI tool has a different set of connectors you can use.</p></li></ul><p>These are confusing! For most people doing real work, the most important additional feature is Deep Research and connecting AI to your content, but you may want to experiment with the others. Increasingly, however, what matters is the harness - the tools the AI has access to. And here, OpenAI and Anthropic have clear leads over Google. Both Claude.ai and ChatGPT have the ability to write and execute code, give you files, do extensive research, and a lot more.  Google&#8217;s Gemini website is much less capable (even though its AI model is just as good),</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sNyH!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44e62d7f-ed4c-44d3-bc93-b4b2867a581b_5312x4355.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"1194\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sNyH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44e62d7f-ed4c-44d3-bc93-b4b2867a581b_5312x4355.png\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>As you can see, asking a similar question gets working spreadsheets and PowerPoints from ChatGPT and Claude, along with clear citations I can follow up on.

I do expect that Google will catch up here soon, however.</p><p>One final note on Chatbots. GPT-5.2 Pro, with the harness that comes with it, is a VERY smart model. It is the model that just helped <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/new-result-theoretical-physics/\">derive a novel result in physics</a> and it is the one I find most capable of doing complex statistical and analytical work.

A growing set of other apps wrap these same models in more powerful harnesses, and they matter.</p><p><strong>Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Google Antigravity</strong> are the most well-developed of these, and they are all aimed at coders. Each of them gives an AI model access to your codebase, a terminal, and the ability to write, run, and test code on its own. You describe what you want built and the AI goes and builds it, coming back when it&#8217;s done or stuck. If you write code for a living, these tools are changing your job. Because they have the most extensive harnesses, even if you don&#8217;t code, they can still do a tremendous amount.</p><p>For example, a couple years ago, I became interested in how you would make an entirely paper-based LLM by providing all of the original GPT-1&#8217;s internal weights and parameters (the code of the AI, listed as 117 million numbers) in a set of books. In theory, with enough time, you could use those numbers to do the math of an AI by hand. This seemed like a fun idea, but obviously not worth doing. A week ago, I asked Claude Code to just do it for me. Over the course of an hour or so (mostly the AI working, with a couple suggestions), it made 80 beautifully laid out volumes containing all of GPT-1, along with a guide to the math. It also came up with, and executed, covers for each volume that visualized the interior weights. It then put together a very elegant website (including the animation below), hooked it up to Stripe for payment and Lulu to print on demand, tested the whole thing, and launched it for me. I never touched or looked at any code. I had it make 20 books available at cost to see what happened - and sold out the same day. All of the volumes are still available as <a href=\"https://weights-press.netlify.app/\">free PDFs on the site</a>. Now, I can have a little project idea that would have required a lot of work, and just have it executed for me with very little effort on my part. </p><div class=\"native-video-embed\"></div><p>But the coding harnesses remain risky for amateurs and, obviously, focused on coding. New apps and harnesses are starting to focus on other types of knowledge work.</p><p><strong>Claude for Excel and Powerpoint </strong>are examples of specific harnesses inside of applications. Both of them provide very impressive extensions to these programs. Claude for Excel, in particular, feels like a massive change in working with spreadsheets, with the potential for a similar impact to Claude Code for those who work with Excel for a living - you can, increasingly, tell the AI what you want to do and it acts a sort of junior analyst and does the work. Because the results are in Excel, they are easy to check. Google has some integration with Google Sheets (but not as deeply) and OpenAI does not really have an equivalent product.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IOnc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc527f70-b3e4-498b-80bb-bfa03f24dd5b_1900x1175.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"Image\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"309.6840659340659\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IOnc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcc527f70-b3e4-498b-80bb-bfa03f24dd5b_1900x1175.png\" title=\"Image\" width=\"501\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><strong><a href=\"https://claude.ai/downloads\">Claude Cowork</a></strong> is something genuinely new, and it deserves its own category. Released by Anthropic in January, Cowork is essentially Claude Code for non-technical work. It runs on your desktop and can work directly with your local files and your browser. However, it is much more secure than Claude Code and less dangerous for non-technical users (it runs in a VM with default-deny networking and hard isolation baked in, for those who care about the details) You describe an outcome (organize these expense reports, pull data from these PDFs into a spreadsheet, draft a summary) and Claude makes a plan, breaks it into subtasks, and executes them on your computer while you watch (or don&#8217;t). It was built on the same agentic architecture as Claude Code, and was itself largely built <em>by</em> Claude Code in about two weeks. Neither OpenAI or Google have a direct equivalent, at least this week. Cowork is still a research preview, meaning it&#8217;s early and will eat through your usage limits fast, but it is a clear sign of where all of this is heading: AI that doesn&#8217;t just talk to you about your work, but does your work.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5NR5!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F933c53d7-43f9-455e-b4e7-2ee52f4a33ee_1565x1184.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"463.2032967032967\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5NR5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F933c53d7-43f9-455e-b4e7-2ee52f4a33ee_1565x1184.png\" width=\"612\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">NotebookLM lets you conduct research reports and gather source documents (on the left), ask questions of the sources and material (the middle) and turn them into things like slide shows (on the right)</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong><a href=\"https://notebooklm.google.com/\">NotebookLM</a></strong> is Google&#8217;s answer to a different problem: how do you use AI to make sense of a lot of information? You can ask NotebookLM to do its own deep research, or else add in your own papers, YouTube videos, websites, or files, and NotebookLM builds an interactive knowledge base you can query, turn into slides, mind maps, videos and, most famously, AI-generated podcasts where two hosts discuss your material (you can even interrupt the hosts to ask questions). If you are a student, a researcher, or anyone who regularly needs to make sense of a pile of documents, NotebookLM is a very useful tool..</p><p>And then there is <strong>OpenClaw</strong>, which I want to mention even though it doesn&#8217;t fit neatly into any of these categories and which you almost definitely shouldn&#8217;t use. OpenClaw is an open-source AI agent that went viral in late January. It runs locally on your computer, connects to whatever AI model you want, and you talk to it like you were chatting with a person using standard chats like WhatsApp or iMessage. It can browse the web, manage your files, send emails, and run commands. It is sort of a 24/7 personal assistant that lives on your machine. It is also a serious security risk: you are giving an AI broad access to your computer and your accounts, and no one knows exactly what dangers you are exposing yourself to. But it does serve as a sign of where things are going.</p><h1><strong>What to do now</strong></h1><p>I know this is a lot. Let me simplify.</p><p>If you are just getting started, pick one of the three systems (ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini), pay the $20, and select the advanced model. The advice from my book still holds: invite AI to everything you do. Start using it for real work. Upload a document you&#8217;re actually working on. <a href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/management-as-ai-superpower\">Give the AI a very complex task in the form of an RFP or SOP.</a> Have a back-and-forth conversation and push it. This alone will teach you more than any guide.</p><p>If you are already comfortable with chatbots, try the specific apps. NotebookLM is free and easy to use, which makes it a good starting place. If you want to go deeper, Anthropic offers the most powerful package in Claude Code, Claude Cowork (both accessible through Claude Desktop) as well as the specialized PowerPoint and Excel Plugins. Give them a try. Again, not as a demo, but with something you actually need done. Watch what it does. Steer it when it goes wrong. You aren&#8217;t prompting, you are (as I wrote in my last piece) managing.</p><p>The shift from chatbot to agent is the most important change in how people use AI since ChatGPT launched. It is still early, and these tools are still hard to figure out and will still do baffling things. But an AI that does things is fundamentally more useful than an AI that says things, and learning to use it that way is worth your time.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/subscribe\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/a-guide-to-which-ai-to-use-in-the?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share\"><span>Share</span></a></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!O-pO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff77c79c7-9fb2-4cd0-b075-a6201a212a6c_1456x816.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"816\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!O-pO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff77c79c7-9fb2-4cd0-b075-a6201a212a6c_1456x816.png\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><p></p>"

This one may or may not be an all-time low, but it&#8217;s pretty good.</p><p>These data are counterintuitive. Are they wrong? </p><h2>Could This Be An Artifact Of Reporting Bias?</h2><p>People could be so inured to crime that they stop reporting it to the police. Or the police could be so overwhelmed that they stop accepting the reports. Since most crime statistics are based on police reports, this would look like crime going down. There&#8217;s some evidence of this happening in specific situations, like <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/i/59053420/claim-6-san-franciscos-soft-on-crime-policies-led-to-rising-crime\">shoplifting in San Francisco</a>. Could it be the whole effect? </p><p>No, for three reasons.</p><p><strong>The National Crime Victimization Survey</strong> <a href=\"https://bjs.ojp.gov/data-collection/ncvs\">is</a> a government-run survey of a 240,000 person nationally representative sample. They find random people and ask whether they were the victims of crimes in the past year. This obviously doesn&#8217;t work for murder, but they keep statistics on rape, assault, larceny, and burglary. Their numbers mostly mirror those reported by police and used in the usual statistics about crime rates. But here there&#8217;s no extra step of needing to trust the police enough to make a report: the surveyors ask the victims directly. Although there could be biases in this methodology too, it would be an extraordinary coincidence if they exactly matched the proposed reporting bias to police.</p><p>Also, you can use NCVS and police reports to calculate reporting rates directly. Overall, they seem to have <em>increased</em> over time - did you know that the 9-1-1 emergency hotline wasn&#8217;t available in most areas until the 1970s? This is especially true for aggravated assault (which will become important later). </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!43la!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7726a00f-8995-4c88-bd7a-62d9a894279c_610x438.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"438\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!43la!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7726a00f-8995-4c88-bd7a-62d9a894279c_610x438.png\" width=\"610\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">(<a href=\"https://sci-hub.st/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2010.00182.x\">source</a>: Baumer and Lauritsen)</figcaption></figure></div><p>There&#8217;s one caveat - FBI statistics show that crime had a small local peak in 2020/2021, then fell in 2023 - 2025. The most recent NCVS survey, in 2024, shows a smaller fall, leaving us still above 2019 lows. There&#8217;s <a href=\"https://jasher.substack.com/p/deciphering-the-2024-national-crime\">some debate</a> over whether the FBI vs. NCVS numbers are better for the 2022 - 2025 period, but they don&#8217;t change the overall trajectory or the fact that we&#8217;re at least close to record lows.</p><p><strong>Murder </strong>is almost always reported to and investigated by police; there&#8217;s a person who should be alive but isn&#8217;t, and people inevitably notice and care about this. Therefore, reported murder rates should be accurate. But murder has decreased at about the same rate as every other crime. Therefore, we should believe that other crimes have gone down too (for the objection that murder statistics are unusually untrustworthy because of improving medical care, see below).</p><p>And <strong>car theft </strong>is <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/24/what-the-data-says-about-crime-in-the-us/\">consistently reported</a> to the police, because insurances require a police report before they will compensate the lost car. So even if the victim doesn&#8217;t trust the police to do a good job investigating, they report it anyway. But car theft rates <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/191216/reported-motor-vehicle-theft-rate-in-the-us-since-1990/\">have declined</a> at similar rates to other crimes. This is further evidence that the decline can&#8217;t be explained by poor reporting.</p><h2>Could This Be An Artifact Of Improving Medical Care?</h2><p>Good medical care can help victims survive, transforming murders into attempted murders or aggravated assaults (after this: &#8220;AM/AA&#8221;). If the same gunshot is only half as likely to kill someone today as it would have been in 1960, then a seemingly-equivalent murder rate would correspond to twice as many people getting shot. Could this explain the apparent decline in murders?</p><p>The argument would go something like: murder is the only crime that we&#8217;re completely sure gets reported consistently. But the murder rate is artificially depressed by improving medical care. Therefore, maybe the seemingly-low murder rate is because of the medical care, the seemingly-low rates of other crimes are because of reporting bias, and actually crime is up.</p><p>We&#8217;ve already seen that several parts of this can&#8217;t be true: other crimes like car theft are reported consistently, and among the inconsistently reported ones, reports are more often increasing than decreasing. But the part about murder also fails on its own terms. </p><p>The source for the claim that improving medical care lowers murder rates is <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/108876790200600203\">Harris et al</a>, which analyzed crime from 1960 - 1999 and concluded that &#8220;the principal explanation of the downward trend in lethality involves parallel developments in medical technology&#8221;. </p><p>They found that aggravated assaults rose faster than murders during this time; AAs increased by 5x, while murders &#8220;merely&#8221; doubled. Under the reasonable assumption that these crimes have similar generators, they suggested that the cause was improved medical care saving the lives of those who would have otherwise died, converting potential murders into AAs. If murders rose at the same rate as AAs, then the true murder rate could be up to 3x higher than reported.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8FyR!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1aa5677-aac7-472f-9c52-7bf0568043bf_583x316.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"316\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8FyR!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1aa5677-aac7-472f-9c52-7bf0568043bf_583x316.png\" width=\"583\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Source: FBI UCR</figcaption></figure></div><p>But more recent research, especially <a href=\"https://sci-hub.st/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1088767914557810\">Eckberg (2014)</a>, challenges this story.

In these data, AAs and murder rose at about the same rate. He concluded that (my emphasis):</p><blockquote><p>Their lethality trend is not compatible with the previous finding [of declining lethality] across 1973 through 1999, remaining stable rather than falling.

Likelihood of dying in the hospital went down, probably because trauma care improved (although this could also be because more of the sickest patients died before entering the hospital). <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5508146/\">Cook et al</a> studied gunshot lethality during a slightly different period - 2003 - 2012 - and also found that it stayed the same overall.</p><p>There are three plausible explanations for gun injuries getting worse over time:</p><ol><li><p>Improved weapons technology (e.g. switch to semi-automatics)</p></li><li><p>Shooters have been in criminal communities a long time and have a good intuitive sense of the likelihood that victims survive. As medical care improves, shooters invest more effort into harming their victims in order to maintain the same likelihood of lethality. For example, it might have been 1970s conventional wisdom in criminal communities that you only had to get one shot in, but it might be 2020s conventional wisdom that you have to get at least three shots to be sure.</p></li><li><p>Changing nature of violence. Many late-20th-century shootings were robberies gone wrong. But armed robberies have decreased even more dramatically than other crimes, because of store security cameras and lower reliance on cash. In an armed robbery gone wrong, the shooter probably just shoots the clerk once and gets out. Now that there are fewer armed robberies, a higher percent of shootings involve shooters who really want to kill the victim and are working hard to make it happen. That means more gunshots to more critical areas.</p></li></ol><p>I conclude that the 1960 - 2000 data are weak, but the best research (Eckberg&#8217;s) suggests stable lethality per act of violence during this time. The 2000 - 2020 data are stronger, and also suggest at-least-stable lethality per act of violence, and can even tell us why: severity of injuries is increasing at a rate comparable to the improvement in medical care.</p><p>Is it suspicious that two very different things are changing at exactly the right rate to cancel one another out, let us ignore the whole problem, take crime statistics at face value? I think so! It would be less suspicious if most of the explanation was (2) - the shooters specifically compensating for increased victim survival rates - but I can&#8217;t tell if this is true or not. But keep in mind that the alternate explanation - that apparent crime rates are around the same as in 1960 because a true increase in crime rates has been masked by improved medical care and reporting bias - also requires two things changing at exactly the same rate in a suspicious way. If we&#8217;re going to do this, we ought to at least take the suspicious cancellation that&#8217;s supported by the data.</p><p>Why are so many forms of crime (murder, violent crime, and property crime) at or near historic lows? This is an unsolved question among criminologists, but proposed answers include:</p><ul><li><p>High crime in the 1970s was caused by lead poisoning, but lead levels have declined precipitously (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93crime_hypothesis\">plausible but controversial</a>)</p></li><li><p>Mass incarceration worked (very plausible for 1990s, but hard to explain why crime continues to decline even as incarceration rates decrease)</p></li><li><p>Increased abortion rates among the underclass prevented the birth of future criminals (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalized_abortion_and_crime_effect#2005_criticism_by_Foote_and_Goetz\">very strongly challenged</a>, but <a href=\"https://freakonomics.com/podcast/abortion-and-crime-revisited-update-2/\">proponents still stand by it</a>)</p></li><li><p>High crime in the 1970s was caused by the drug trade. The rise of cell phones has replaced street-corner drug dealers with &#8220;a guy I know from college&#8221;, which necessitates fewer street-corner turf wars.</p></li><li><p>Security cameras and DNA testing have increased clearance rates. The smart criminals know they&#8217;ll be caught and don&#8217;t commit crimes; the dumb criminals commit one crime, get caught, <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/prison-and-crime-much-more-than-you\">go to prison</a>, and are out of commission for a while.</p></li><li><p>Increased psychiatric care: all of the would-be criminals are on SSRIs, antipsychotics, and Adderall.</p></li><li><p>Welfare programs, community policing, Hugs Not Crime After School Activity Circles, and/or whatever Palantir is doing actually work.</p></li><li><p>The anti-police backlash after Black Lives Matter <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/what-caused-the-2020-homicide-spike\">increased crime so much</a> that it caused a backlash-to-the-backlash that gave police even more community support and resources than they had before (this is my explanation for why crime dropped so profoundly in 2023, 2024, and 2025 in particular)</p></li><li><p>All the criminals are too addicted to video games and Instagram to commit any crimes.</p></li></ul><p>Zooming out a level, why shouldn&#8217;t crime be at historic lows? We&#8217;re a safetyist culture. Car accident fatalities are near historic lows after we mandated airbags and other safety features. Childhood injuries and deaths are near historic lows after we mandated that all playgrounds be made of Styrofoam. Various forms of hospital error are near historic lows after we let lawyers sue hospitals for zillions of dollars if they weren&#8217;t. Why should crime be the exception?</p><p>The next question is: why do people&#8217;s intuitions clash so violently with the statistics? More on that soon.</p>"

Anthropic very much wants to help DoW defend our country and make us strong. It is clear there have been some large misunderstandings here about how LLMs work.</p>\n<p>They are not ordinary tools like spreadsheets that automatically do whatever the user asks, nor would it be safe to make them so, nor do they predictably adhere to written rule sets or take instructions from their CEO in a crisis. And they are probabilistic. You do not and cannot get absolute guarantees.</p>\n<div>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-25108\"></span>\n\n\n</div>\n<p>The only way to know if an AI model will do what you need in a crisis is something you needed to be do regardless of potential refusals, and which is also what you must do with human soldiers, which is to run the simulations and mock battles and drills and tests that tell you if the model can do and is willing to do the job.</p>\n<p>If there are irreconcilable differences and the military contract needs to end, that would be a shame and a lost opportunity, and hopefully both sides could help ensure a smooth transition, but that would ultimately be fine. OpenAI and Google are waiting as qualified alternative suppliers.</p>\n<p>The far bigger issue is that we are now at risk of having the Pentagon designate Anthropic as a \u2018supply chain risk,\u2019 the primary effect of which would be to cause expensive and severe disruptions across the defense industry and at many large companies and impose nightmaring compliance requirements indefinitely. It would make us far less safe, would be a major norm violation, and would not address any actual supply chain risks. Everyone I have seen who has encountered this proposal and knew what it meant knew it would backfire on America horribly if implemented. No one wants that other than our enemies.</p>\n<p>Alas, I am the wrong person to deliver a detailed message on this, for many reasons, so I will simply say the above for now, and then proceed to the monthly roundup.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Table of Contents</h4>\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/bad-news\">Bad News.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/government-working\">Government Working.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/the-epstein-files\">The Epstein Files.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/rip-scott-adams\">RIP Scott Adams.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/news-you-can-t-use-but-click-on-anyway\">News You Can\u2019t Use But Click On Anyway.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/we-re-putting-together-a-team\">We\u2019re Putting Together A Team.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/you-can-t-retire-i-quit\">You Can\u2019t Retire, I Quit.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/jones-act-watch\">Jones Act Watch.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/variously-effective-altruism\">Variously Effective Altruism.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/they-took-our-jobs-and-now-i-can-relax\">They Took Our Jobs And Now I Can Relax.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/while-i-cannot-condone-this\">While I Cannot Condone This.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/good-news-everyone\">Good News, Everyone.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/use-your-one-time\">Use Your One Time.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/hands-off-my-phone\">Hands Off My Phone.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/fun-theory\">Fun Theory.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/good-advice\">Good Advice.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/for-your-entertainment\">For Your Entertainment.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/plur1bus\">Plur1bus.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/gamers-gonna-game-game-game-game-game\">Gamers Gonna Game Game Game Game Game.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/sports-go-sports\">Sports Go Sports.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/the-revolution-of-retroactive-rising-expectations\">The Revolution of Retroactive Rising Expectations.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/i-was-promised-spying-cars\">I Was Promised Spying Cars.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/prediction-market-madness\">Prediction Market Madness.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/i/187901486/the-lighter-side\">The Lighter Side.</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bad News</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/dilanesper/status/2012608927075307816\">Pete Buttigieg wants to change the constitution</a> to strip corporations of personhood, and to say money is not speech, which are no good, very bad proposals in ways he most definitely understands.

It also applies in American cities. I also affirm my commitment to a whole slew of basic civil rights, the right to a lawyer and due process of law, the right to not be indefinitely detained for no reason, the right to walk around without \u2018your papers,\u2019 your right to not get physically attacked or tortured including while in official custody, your right to freedom of speech and to film what is happening to you, the right to bear arms, and my opposition to those who violate them, and to those who knowingly fund and enable such violations.</p>\n<p>I also oppose the government lying to the people, or attempting to smear murder victims, or engaging in witness intimidation, or forcibly cutting off access to such crime scenes, or trying to use such actions as a form of extortion or punishment of a particular area or its government. It also extends to creating conditions likely to lead to bad shootings that kill people even if they aren\u2019t straight up murders, or attempts to lie about what happened and the nature of the victims, and to cover it all up.</p>\n<p>I believe that government public communications lying to the public should (with notably rare and specified exceptions) be criminally illegal, and that our laws on this are inadequate and must be updated.</p>\n<p>I leave the fact question of \u2018how much of this happened or is happening\u2019 to others.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2026/01/should-you-resign.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=should-you-resign\">Alex Tabarrok asks, [when] should you resign</a> if you are part of an institution doing harm?</p>\n<blockquote><p>Alex Tabarrok: Resignation keeps your hands and conscience clean. That\u2019s good for you but what about society? Utilitarians sometimes call the demand for clean hands a form of moral self-indulgence. A privileging of your own purity over outcomes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cla.csulb.edu/departments/philosophy/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rdgrp_ethicsWilliams2.pdf\">Bernard Williams\u2019s reply</a> is that good people are not just sterile utility-accountants, they have deep moral commitments and sometimes resignation is what fidelity to those commitments requires.</p>\n<p>So what\u2019s the right move? I see four considerations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complicity: Are you being ordered to do wrong, or, usually the lesser crime, of not doing right?</li>\n<li>Voice: If you stay can you exercise voice? What\u2019s your concrete theory of change\u2014what can you actually block, document, or escalate?</li>\n<li>Timing: Is reversal possible soon or is this structural capture? Are you the remnant?</li>\n<li>Self-discipline: Will you name the bright lines now and keep them, or will \u201cjust this once\u201d become the job?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have not been put in a position to make such a choice but from a social point of view, my judgment is that at the current time<em>,</em> voice is needed and more effective than exit.\u200b</p></blockquote>\n<p>Often my view is that \u2018don\u2019t resign but do the right thing and take bold risks with zero regard to whether you are fired, since you almost quit on the margin anyway, and you make them either change or eventually fire you\u2019 is usually superior to resigning if you can do it, the exception being if your resignation would send a super strong signal. It\u2019s even reasonable to actively take a job with that intention.</p>\n<p>But there are few who can do it, staying does tend to enable the harm that is happening, and resignation beats complicity.</p>\n<p>One instinct is that if resignations would not be a way of exercising voice, as things are so far gone that no one would notice, then staying won\u2019t give you voice either.</p>\n<p>I also believe that <a href=\"https://x.com/allgarbled/status/2015666321451819190\">we should not police the failure of a particular person in private life to speak up on a particular issue they are not directly involved with, basically ever,</a> even if they are speaking up on other issues. Saying \u2018you talked about bad thing [X] being bad but not about bad thing [Y]\u2019 is a terrible anti-pattern, it goes nowhere good, and we have seen how out of control it can quickly get.</p>\n<p>Saying you are going to cap credit card interest rates is popular. <a href=\"https://t.co/aL3e8AYKIy\">Actually doing so at a number like 10% would be terrible economics and also (once people see the results) unpopular</a>. So yes, I do appreciate Trump\u2019s strategy of saying he\u2019ll do it (popular!) and then not doing it (also, relative to alternatives, popular!)</p>\n<p>California remains in crisis over the proposed wealth tax.

I am going to leave all the details about who did what to whom, or who covered what up, to others.</p>\n<p>There is one thing I think hasn\u2019t been said prominently that is worth saying, which is that I think this from Nikhil Pal Singh is on the right track but importantly wrong.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/nikhil_palsingh/status/2020200519353127412\">Nikhil Pal Singh</a>: translated from a Spanish paper:</p>\n<p>\u201cEpstein wasn\u2019t selling girls\u2019 bodies, he was selling the experience of impunity. The end product was not the sexual act, but the assurance that there would be no consequences.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The less important reason this is wrong is that he was very much also selling the actual experience along with the feeling of impunity.</p>\n<p>The more important reason this is wrong is that, as I understand these dynamics, he was often selling something more important than impunity. He sold kompromat.</p>\n<p>That sounds backwards. Why would someone want Epstein to have the ability blackmail them? That\u2019s the trap, that\u2019s bad, right? You lure these rich and powerful people to the island, get them to do horrible things, and then you have power.</p>\n<p>Because if you are now part of this conspiracy doing horrible things, and others that know about it have this leverage over you, then (as perverse and crazy as this is) that means, to types like this, that you can be trusted. You\u2019ve proven you won\u2019t care when others do maximally horrible things, and if you step out of line then they can ruin you, so obviously you won\u2019t cause any trouble. You\u2019re part of the team.</p>\n<p>That also explains a bunch of other vile behaviors that seem to be emergently misaligned, designed to be maximally evil and vile rather than because anyone actually wants to do, see or experience a given thing. This is not an accident.</p>\n<p>Everyone involved needs to be unmasked, investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. If that would truly be so disruptive that our civilization would collapse, then there is a term for what must then be done instead: Truth and reconciliation.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">RIP Scott Adams</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-dilbert-afterlife?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=89120&amp;post_id=184503512&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=67wny&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email\">RIP Scott Adams</a>.</p>\n<p>Scott Alexander offers reflections and then his <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-scott?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=89120&amp;post_id=184894292&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=67wny&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email\">standard highlights from the comments</a>. I thought it was an excellent post, and if I do die I want the writeups to similarly include both the good and the bad.</p>\n<p>I will add that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I too greatly enjoyed the old Dilbert cartoons and his early books.</li>\n<li>I was reading Adams\u2019s analysis of the Trump campaign in real time in 2016 and he absolutely figured out a bunch of central stuff everyone else missed.</li>\n<li>It\u2019s not clear the extent to which Adams\u2019s overconfident and increasingly crazy predictions were \u2018real\u2019 versus he was being strategic or doing his supposed \u2018hypnosis\u2019 thing.</li>\n<li>It became increasingly painful to read those predictions and his associated claims, and it was clear Adams was trying to copy various Trump persuasion tactics that he could spot from the outside but didn\u2019t instinctively grok well enough or have the required secondary powers to make them consistently work.</li>\n<li>After that things went increasingly off the rails and I agree with Scott Alexander that this was centrally genuine. There\u2019s quite a lot of evidence for that along the way. I do think he was also engaging in various \u2018persuasion\u2019 and \u2018hypnosis\u2019 tactics, as he understood them, so he would also Say That Which He Believed Was Not.</li>\n<li>He really did write or say a lot of things in what, to everyone but especially to someone In My Culture, is the most annoying way possible.</li>\n<li>What Adams called \u2018hypnosis\u2019 is centrally more like NLP and sloganeering, and is only \u2018hypnosis\u2019 in the sense that everything is hypnosis. It\u2019s mostly not full or \u2018real\u2019 hypnosis. The thing he was doing is real and can be powerful but it\u2019s not the same, and he often botched the execution.

The latter was used to avoid Neutrality Laws and ship aid &#8211; particularly 100 octane gas &#8211; to the UK. Liberia, as one of the few independent states in Africa needed economic support.</p>\n<p>3&#x20e3;Marshall Plan of 1949 provides loans to counties to rebuild critical infrastructure, including shipyards. Many of which adopt the pre-fabrication method of the US</p>\n<p>4&#x20e3;US set up the Military Sea Transportation Service in 1949 (now Military Sealift Command) to handle sealift for the Dept of Defense, thereby reducing its level of dependency on the US merchant marine.</p>\n<p>5&#x20e3; New cargo handling technologies are introduced, but a few &#8211; LASH, SeaBee, Roll-on/Roll-off &#8211; are not commercially viable and lead to the demise of some key shipping companies.</p>\n<p>6&#x20e3; Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 leads to the creation of the Interstate Highway System. This reduces the need for coastal (cabotage) shipping as cargo shifts to trucks.</p>\n<p>7&#x20e3; The introduction of DC8 and 707 in 1958 shifted the movement of people from rail and ship to plane. This opened up cargo capacity on the nation\u2019s rail system.</p>\n<p>8&#x20e3;Colonial Pipeline 1962 saw a massive reduction in the number of product tankers needed from the Gulf of Mexico to the US East Coast</p>\n<p>9&#x20e3; Vietnam War demonstrated the utility of the containership (see The Box) but the failure to invest a new program to sponsor ship construction until the MMA 1970, allowed Europe and Japan &#8211; using some of those protectionist methods you oppose &#8211; to surpass the US.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\ud83d\udd1f\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f51f.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" />The 1980s saw the end of construction differentials under the Merchant Marine Act of 1936. This witnessed the end of ship construction for ships in the international trade as the US Navy wanted to ship construction of their 600-ship Navy exclusively into private yards, but the end of the Cold War saw US yards lose not just commercial, but also military business.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So to summarize:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We didn\u2019t hold other countries for economic ransom in 1946. How dare we.</li>\n<li>Liberia has a ship registry.</li>\n<li>We helped other countries have their own shipyards. How dare we.</li>\n<li>The military sealift command uses its own ships.</li>\n<li>Cargo handling techniques were introduced that were not commercially viable, so key shipping companies died.</li>\n<li>The Interstate Highway System reduced shipping demand.</li>\n<li>Airplanes reduced shipping demand and opened up rail capacity.</li>\n<li>The Colonial Pipeline reduced demand in 1962.</li>\n<li>The US government did not pay for the development of container ships in time.</li>\n<li>The US Navy stopped subsidizing the commercial shipyards.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A lot of this is trying to say, oh, we have roads and trains and pipelines and airplanes, so who even needs ships? The rest (aside from #2 which is deeply silly, given the vast number of similar alternatives and that it\u2019s irrelevant anyway) is \u2018you didn\u2019t give us enough money and subsidies, and didn\u2019t extort or exploit our allies enough.\u2019</p>\n<p>And that all explains why we have approximately zero shipbuilding and zero ships, and we should keep having approximately zero ships to protect that approximately zero shipbuilding. It keeps us strong, you see.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Variously Effective Altruism</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://coefficientgiving.org/research/allocating-175m-to-givewells-recommendations-for-2026/\">Coefficient giving renews its grant the GiveWell\u2019s recommended charities,</a> upping its commitment to $175 million for 2026.

It is dramatized in a few popular works of fiction, including the Incredibles, and so here is your friendly neighborhood infrastructure nerd saying this is very real.</p>\n<p>It was, in my recollection, literally written down that we could not *tell* the caller about the existence of the escape hatch.</p>\n<p>Trainee: Are we allowed to hint about the existence of the escape hatch?<br />\nTrainer: The rule is you are not allowed to tell the caller about it.</p>\n<p>Trainee: That didn\u2019t answer my question.<br />\nTrainee: Didn\u2019t it. Moving on.</p>\n<p>I was nowhere near sophisticated at reading subtexts at the time in life where I took that training to understand that different people in the room understood the trainer differently.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is bizarre and perverse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Retrospective review of the written rules, which must exist, will discover that they contain a rule which the company is extremely comfortable with defending.

Clicking a button in the computer program awards the caller money from the company.</p>\n<p>The company is not willing to have its CS reps push that button for no reason whatsoever, but in its considered judgement spends ~0 management attention reviewing the decision of $10/hr 18 year olds to click that button. So it trains them on a rule, and also on what the military would call \u201ccommander\u2019s intent\u201d about that rule, and to the extremely limited degree it trusts its Tier One CS workers, trusts that they are the final authority on clicking.</p>\n<p>Note that I said ~0 management attention. My line manager once asked me whether I understood the button. Although I did not understand why he asked that question, retrospectively, it must have been because I was anomalous on a weekly report circulated back to him.</p>\n<p>The entirety of that calculation.</p>\n<p>Me: Yes sir I understand the button.<br />\nManager: And you always had a reason to click the button.<br />\nMe: Yes sir I always have a reason to click the button.<br />\nManager: Carry on, Patrick.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow costly was the button?\u201d</p>\n<p>I likely cost the company more by pressing it at the low-but-anomalous frequency I did than the company paid me in wages. Very within the model, right.</p>\n<p>And this is one reason why I, when talking to CS reps, sometimes whether is there a set of facts under which they have personal authority to click a button. Very few businesses specifically anticipate that question in the rulebook.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hands Off My Phone</h4>\n\n\n<p>Remember that <a href=\"https://x.com/moultano/status/2017816889632985120\">the 5th amendment protects your passwords but not your fingerprints</a>.</p>\n<p>So as a good principle, if it is plausible the US Government would try to get into your phone, and you wouldn\u2019t want them to do that, don\u2019t enable fingerprint unlock.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/runasand/status/2017659019251343763\">Runa Sandvik</a>: The FBI was able to access Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson\u2019s Signal messages because she used Signal on her work laptop.

I agree, but fun is not the opposite of boredom. If the service was actually moving you, if you cared about what you were saying, it wouldn\u2019t be boring.</p>\n<p>Then you miss out on all the other benefits of having a shared community and ethical system, regardless of what you think of the religious beliefs themselves.</p>\n<p>I also saw people complaining about how church used to last an hour and now it is often ninety minutes.

I did not realize how bad things had gotten. What I find most confusing is that these are film students, who want to study film and make film, and they still can\u2019t do it. I do sympathize with the complaint that old movies can be painfully slow, but when a film student literally can\u2019t name a film they watched recently, have only watched Disney films, or can\u2019t sit through a showing, maybe go do something else?</p>\n<p>Professors are split as to whether to accept this, or try to help students fix it. I strongly endorse the later strategy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/2013979603778277577\">A common theme of movies set in either authoritarian regimes</a>, or in the past, is that living under authoritarian regimes or in the past kind of really sucked a lot. As Matthew Yglesias points out, everyone everywhere has problems but you\u2019d much rather have liberal democracy problems of family drama and anxiety in the style of Sentimental Value, in a modern liberal democracy, than you would have the problems of Hamnet where your children can\u2019t get medical care (and you can\u2019t communicate with your spouse easily when you have to live apart) or in Secret Agent when you\u2019re in an authoritarian regime.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/SandyofCthulhu/status/2020241732517130568\">A very strong endorsement of the memoirs of U.S. Grant</a>, and <a href=\"https://x.com/SandyofCthulhu/status/2020314344987455564\">here\u2019s a great anecdote</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Plur1bus</h4>\n\n\n<p>To not be left behind, I watched the first season of Plur1bus.

I\u2019m mildly glad I stuck it out.</p>\n<p>As others have noted, it cares more about particular characters than its overarching plot. I was disappointed that they did what media often does now, which is take a potentially interesting philosophical or moral question, and then give one side an increasing set of reasons why \u2018oh obviously they\u2019re wrong.\u2019 A recent example that isn\u2019t much of a spoiler would be in the new Superman movie.</p>\n<p>Indeed, not only have I \u2018seen this movie before\u2019 several times, as Carol puts it (upcoming link url itself is a potential spoiler in both directions so if you don\u2019t want to know don\u2019t look), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_season_4\">I\u2019ve seen this show before in quite some detail</a>, including remarkably similar catches to tip the scales.

The same goes for other simulated negative actions. As with many such heuristics, this would fall apart if there was reason for someone to actively fake this attribute, but you can usually rule that out and it almost never happens.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been playing through the Dragon Quest 2D-HD remakes. First up was Dragon Quest 3, now I\u2019m on Dragon Quest 1, as this is the explicitly intended order.</p>\n<p>My feeling on Dragon Quest 3 was that it was a fun game as a remake, but it had a few key flaws.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As with many old games, when you fix Quality of Life issues like how you save the game or what happens if you die, or you give too clear indicators of where to go, you disrupt key balancing mechanisms. The barriers, and having to figure things out, are inherent to a lot of the fun, including needing to fight your way to a boss.</li>\n<li>The new Monster Wrangler class is basically a \u2018you have to look up the info\u2019 class, since it scales with how many monsters you catch, and it is clearly the way you are \u2018supposed to\u2019 beat the game given Wild Side. Way too many of the monsters and bosses in the late game will shut you out of casting spells, which forces you to switch over to Monster Wrangler.</li>\n<li>It\u2019s way too easy to randomly die in the later dungeons if you\u2019re at levels that keep the bosses interesting, in ways that don\u2019t feel fair.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For Dragon Quest 1, I\u2019m not done yet, but I think it extends those mistakes and is largely a failure, because it loses the elegance of the original and tries to shoehorn in a lot of extra spells and extra story that I feel don\u2019t add anything. I get that the original was basically one long grind, but that\u2019s kind of the point. Also, you spend a lot of time during which healing during battles de facto doesn\u2019t work, which means you just have to unleash and hope you don\u2019t die.</p>\n<p>But mostly the game destroys the key tensions in the original Dragon Quest 1, which is that if you push harder you might die and have to go back to the castle and lose half your gold, and also you need to map and figure things out. I\u2019m still going to finish, but it\u2019s kind of out of a sense of honor or obligation than that I\u2019m having that much fun.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/Liv_Boeree/status/2021315141539688771\">Liv Boeree is correct</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/TommySiegel/status/2021265434994004069\">Tommy Siegel</a>: every relationship needs one of each, i think</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jZFy!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9c33914e-662f-40f8-84bf-84bdbd8fcc53_1200x1200.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/Liv_Boeree/status/2021315141539688771\">Liv Boeree</a>: no the best is when you\u2019re both green but use that shared love language to make the experience feel like yellow</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sports Go Sports</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2026/01/who-is-good-at-soccer.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=who-is-good-at-soccer\">Successful soccer players tend to have many exceptional cognitive skills</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2026/02/the-economics-of-the-nba-trading-deadline-from-my-email.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-economics-of-the-nba-trading-deadline-from-my-email\">Discussion of the economics of the NBA trading deadline</a>, as teams respond to their incentives and find loopholes in the rules. They need to hire some of us gamers to design better rules, especially around preventing tanking but also in other ways.</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s tanking, where we all are talking price. Everyone agrees that NBA teams that can no longer compete are under no obligation to maximize their chances of winning more games.

So as long as losing sometimes gets you those players, tanking is inevitable. He contrasts with the NFL where individual players are less valuable (less than he makes it out, yes Sam Darnold won the Super Bowl convincingly but it turns out he\u2019s actually Good At Job and the QB is like a quarter of your team, and NFL teams \u2018should\u2019 tank way more, but yes).</p>\n<p>I see six schools of thought about ethical tanking.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Tanking is ethical, full stop, it is the league\u2019s job to set the rules.</li>\n<li>Tanking by the front office is ethical, tanking by the coach or players is not.</li>\n<li>Tanking by nonplayers is acceptable, but not by the players.</li>\n<li>Tanking by nonplayers is acceptable, but only to the point of indifference to winning or putting a competitive product on the field this year.</li>\n<li>Tanking by nonplayers is acceptable, but only to the point of plausible deniability.</li>\n<li>Tanking is fine if and only if your fans approve of it.</li>\n<li>Tanking is never acceptable, how dare you, sir.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can all agree that a player actively trying to lose the game is not acceptable, although if they decide to try a new play or be selfish with their stats, well, okay then.</p>\n<p>I can see an argument for all six positions. I think for now the answer should basically be #6, if the fans cheer when you tank then the NBA is the one with the problem.</p>\n<p>Ultimately the current lottery is half measure. I see a few different ways out of this, shortening the season would help a lot, but fundamentally you need to make it so that teams want to win the game. I see basically two ways to do that.</p>\n<p>Method one is financial incentives. Put a financial value on each game. You can buy those top picks if you want, but they will not come cheap. Claude estimates that $3 million per game would mostly do the trick, and you\u2019d have to adjust the luxury tax rate for obvious reasons. But, man, that\u2019s good TV.</p>\n<p>The other solution is to take away the incentive to tank entirely. Bite the bullet. All non-playoff teams pick in a fully random order, or something else drastic. You could get creative, and have a loser\u2019s playoff or late season reversed incentive for the top pick in some fashion. Have fun with it.</p>\n<p>You could also simply accept that tanking is fine, actually, and let it be in the open.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Revolution of Retroactive Rising Expectations</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/zdch/status/2013279490898636971\">Zac Hill</a>: The other thing that happens in this discourse is that people get the timelines all wrong.

Either you have traders who get beat, who are hedging, or who are subsidizing the market, or who are manipulating prices or themselves.</p>\n<p>\u200bI think it is inevitable that the bulk of the volume will be where there is the best product-market fit, and it will be on places where the information is not so socially valuable, like sports and crypto, over short time horizons.</p>\n<p>I also think this is fine, as it serves several purposes.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It draws in liquidity and eyes, which can then be directed elsewhere.</li>\n<li>It creates an incentive to draw in eyes or improve reputation, by providing socially valuable markets.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As in, at equilibrium, Polymarket and others should be creating some markets that are money-losing but that function as brand building and advertising.

The problem with AMMs is that most of the subsidy often ends up wasted, because you get run over, and make dumb trades, and don\u2019t get the capture much of the benefits of two-way volume. The AMM is a deeply dumb trader.

A lot has been going on in my life lately (my blog will have a post out on Friday with more information), and as a result I haven't really had the energy to work on Anubis in publicly visible ways. There are things going on behind the scenes, but nothing is really shippable yet, sorry!</p>\n        <p>I've also been feeling some burnout in the wake of perennial waves of anger directed towards me. I'm handling it, I'll be fine, I've just had a lot going on in my life and it's been rough.</p>\n        <p>I've been missing the sense of wanderlust and discovery that comes with the artistic way I playfully develop software. I suspect that some of the stresses I've been through (setting up a complicated surgery in a country whose language you aren't fluent in is kind of an experience) have been sapping my energy. I'd gonna try to mess with things on my break, but realistically I'm probably just gonna be either watching Stargate SG-1 or doing unreasonable amounts of ocean fishing in Final Fantasy 14. Normally I'd love to keep the details about my medical state fairly private, but I'm more of a public figure now than I was this time last year so I don't really get the invisibility I'm used to for this.</p>\n        <p>I've also had a fair amount of negativity directed at me for simply being much more visible than the anonymous threat actors running the scrapers that are ruining everything, which though understandable has not helped.</p>\n        <p>Anyways, it all worked out and I'm about to be in the hospital for a week, so if things go really badly with this release please downgrade to the last version and/or upgrade to the main branch when the fix PR is inevitably merged.
