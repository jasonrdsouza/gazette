                "<p>Every now and then, people ask me why I write. I don\u2019t get paid to write here, so it\u2019s not immediately obvious why I keep writing.</p>\n\n<p>I think writing is one of the most valuable things you can do, and I recommend everyone try it. Here\u2019s why:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>It makes you a better thinker and communicator.</strong> Writing is a muscle. The more you write, the easier it gets, and your ability improves. You\u2019ll learn to make clearer arguments, crisper explanations, and better empathize with your audience. These skills are applicable to everything.</li>\n  <li><strong>You\u2019ll get feedback that makes you a better writer.</strong> Feedback exposes weak arguments and strengthens the good ones. Plus, learning to listen to feedback is another skill that is universally applicable.</li>\n  <li><strong>You\u2019ll meet people interested in the same things you are.</strong> Looking through my correspondence, it\u2019s amazing how many of my favorite people to chat with I met through writing online. (BTW, this goes both ways. If you read something that resonates with you online, write them a note thanking them and telling them what you liked!)</li>\n  <li><strong>Your past thinking will be archived and searchable.</strong> This is more valuable than you think. If you invest time to hone a piece, you\u2019ll turn back to it more often than you\u2019d expect. Further, reviewing old pieces and threads over time will reveal what worked and what didn\u2019t while making your progress tangible.</li>\n  <li><strong>The value of your writing compounds.</strong> The value <em>to you</em>, that is. I don\u2019t think my pieces from 6 years ago are improving anyone\u2019s life, but the contacts I\u2019ve made and pieces I\u2019ve crafted have grown into a foundation I get to leverage everyday.</li>\n  <li><strong>Writing gives you a license to explore and organize your thoughts.</strong> This is the fun bit. Chasing down an idea that interests you, forming questions and then investigating them; it\u2019s a joy. The second most common question I get about my writing is, \u201cHow do you motivate yourself to write?\u201d This is the answer. There are so many drafts that live, dormant in my draft folder. So many times I start a piece and lose interest. And then: something will <em>click</em> and I\u2019ll draft, investigate, and finish a piece in an hour (here\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/12/19/how-model-use-has-changed-in-2025.html\">two</a> <a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/10/20/speeds-and-swarms.html\">examples</a>). These aren\u2019t always the most substantive pieces, but they keep the practice going and the momentum up.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It\u2019s hard to form new habits. But writing is s the best investment you can make <em>today</em>. Here\u2019s a few tips for getting started:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Be okay with bad writing.</strong> Most writing isn\u2019t great! If my hit rate is 1 out of 5, I\u2019m <em>thrilled</em>. Get comfortable publishing things that aren\u2019t perfect. I know many people who wait too long to publish and, well, never do. They do this for <em>years</em>. If they\u2019d gotten the ball rolling back then, they\u2019d be better writers today. It\u2019s weird: you\u2019d think regular private writing would be sufficient to get better. But it isn\u2019t. There\u2019s no stakes. No feedback. The only way to get better is to ship. Some people worry about the risk of bad writing. I think the biggest risk comes from being an asshole (so don\u2019t be an asshole!) But the actual risks are quite low: most bad writing is neutral, it remains unread.</li>\n  <li><strong>You need to do the writing. Not AI.</strong> Writing is exercise. If I brought a forklift to the gym and used it to lift weights, what would be the point?</li>\n  <li><strong>But AI is a wonderful editor.</strong> When you\u2019re getting started, it\u2019s intimidating to ask people for feedback on drafts. Thankfully, AI is great at this! Paste in your draft and prompt it with something like, \u201cThis is a blog draft where I am trying to argue X, read the piece and identify any spelling or grammar errors, places where I am not being clear or where a reader might be confused, or areas where my argument is weak.\u201d Take it with a grain of salt, but this is usually very, very helpful.</li>\n  <li><strong>Don\u2019t overthink where to publish.</strong> Make pages public on Notion. Use Github pages. Use Substack, if you must. The only thing you cannot omit is an easy contact form and a way for someone to subscribe. I screwed this up for too long. RSS is not sufficient. Comments don\u2019t count (in fact, turn them off). Let people email you with a form, one-on-one. The other thing to keep in mind is to pick something with low friction. If it takes too many steps to create a new post, you won\u2019t.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I hope you start a blog this year. Or revive an old one.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019d like some further advice, <a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/contact.html\">feel free to reach out</a>!</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<form action=\"https://buttondown.com/api/emails/embed-subscribe/dbreunig\" class=\"embeddable-buttondown-form\" method=\"post\" target=\"popupwindow\">\n  <label for=\"bd-email\">Enter your email to receive the occasional update.</label>\n  <div class=\"form-input\">\n    <input id=\"bd-email\" name=\"email\" type=\"email\" />\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Subscribe\" />\n  </div>\n</form>"

My AI coding agents have been using Linear as the project and issue tracking tool on a new project. I've opened Linear's web interface...twice? And I'm pretty sure I've logged into the mobile client. But Claude and friends? They use Linear every day.</p>\n<p>To date, I've been using the first-party Linear MCP and a third party one that I'd found before Anthropic started publishing an &quot;official&quot; Linear plugin in partnership with Linear.</p>\n<p>It works great.</p>\n<p>There's just one problem. The official Linear MCP has 25 tools, using a total of 19,659 tokens of context on every single session. The third-party MCP is a little slimmer at 17k and change. But that's still nearly 10% of the full context window. For <em>every</em> context window.</p>\n<p>This morning, after breakfast, I sat down and started chatting with Claude about what a better Linear tool might look like. We discussed just using a unix commandline tool. We discussed using a unix commandline tool + a <a href=\"https://agentskills.io\">skill</a>. We discussed a Skill + a single-tool MCP client that was <em>just</em> a pure GraphQL client.</p>\n<p>I asked Claude to read <a href=\"https://blog.fsck.com/2025/10/19/mcps-are-not-like-other-apis/\">my blog post on MCP design</a>.</p>\n<p>We ended up with something nice and streamlined. It totals out at 975 tokens, including instructions for how to learn more about how to use the tool. I ended up talking Claude into making the MCP fully self-documenting by including a 'help' action.</p>\n<p>We ended up compromising on tool design. Claude really thought that it would be fine always reading the instructions and just using raw GraphQL for everything. I overruled it and decided that the most common operations (working with tickets) merited first-class actions. Everything else is GraphQL backed up by the 'help' action.</p>\n<p>It's called <a href=\"https://github.com/obra/streamlinear\">Streamlinear</a>. Ultimately, I'm responsible for the name. I didn't say no. I asked Claude to come up with a list of punny names. Everything else it suggested was being used for a Linear client already.</p>\n<p>I asked Claude to talk about the new tool and what it's like:</p>\n<p><a class=\"glightbox\" href=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251227-132229.png\"><img alt=\"pasted image 20251227 132229\" src=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251227-132229.png\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is the tool loadout for the 'official' MCP:</p>\n<p><a class=\"glightbox\" href=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251227-134359.png\"><img alt=\"pasted image 20251227 134359\" src=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251227-134359.png\" /></a></p>\n<p>And this is what Streamlinear looks like:</p>\n<p><a class=\"glightbox\" href=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251227-134628.png\"><img alt=\"pasted image 20251227 134628\" src=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251227-134628.png\" /></a></p>\n<p>Give it a spin and let me know how it goes.</p>"

It was the first day of school for the year, and I was studying at <em>Sekolah Kebangsaan Batu Lanchang</em>, which in English is \u201cBatu Lanchang National School\u201d. When you\u2019re seven years old, being told that you\u2019ve got to wait an hour to see your best friend is an insurmountable obstacle. It feels like <em>forever</em>. The year it would take to go up another grade is, accordingly, so long that it\u2019s not even imaginable.</p> <p>I recall thinking, probably in simpler language, \u201cI probably won\u2019t make it to eight years old. A year is way too much time for something random to happen.
