                "<p>The screen on my phone is about half the size of a credit card. I bought it to overcome my smartphone addiction, but discovered something far more interesting: People are utterly fascinated by it. So much so that there\u2019s nothing about me or anything I\u2019ve ever done that has gotten as much attention as my phone.</p> <figure>  <source class=\"responsive-img-srcset\" /> <img class=\"img-fluid rounded z-depth-1\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://lukaspetersson.github.io/assets/img/jelly-star.png\" width=\"60%\" />  </figure> <p>I used to be addicted to my smartphone, and it made me a worse person. My work was less focused and productive. I lost creative ideas because my phone stole those precious moments of boredom. And I was a worse friend - every time I reached for my phone, I signaled to the people around me that they weren\u2019t the most important thing at that moment.</p> <p>For many years, I tried to find a solution. First, I tried app blockers. That often worked for a few months, but eventually I always found a reason to turn them off (temporarily, I lied to myself). After realizing that app blockers would not do it, I bought a dumb phone. However, that did not last long either. Today\u2019s society expects you to have a smartphone for basic tasks like transportation, meeting friends, banking and navigation. Once, I could not find a friend at the agreed location, and I could not contact them without WhatsApp. I also tried to wear a smart-watch without a phone for a while, but this was also too limiting.</p> <p>For a while, I gave up on my quest for a solution. Until I met Esben, who carried a small phone (Jelly Star). Still a smartphone (Android), but very, very small. I immediately bought one and it has had the desired effect. The screen is so small that you don\u2019t really want to use it. I\u2019m, of course, very happy about this, but there\u2019s another effect that unexpectedly has been even bigger - it is the best conversation starter ever.</p> <p>It is impossible to convey how much interest I get from people around me when I pull out my phone. In my post-big-phone life, I have small conversations daily with strangers at all places where I have to show my phone. Whether I\u2019m scanning my boarding pass at the airport, paying at the supermarket checkout, showing tickets at the movie theater, checking in at the doctor\u2019s office, or mingling at networking events; every single time the phone comes out, a conversation begins. The funniest encounter was at the post office where the guy at the counter asked if he could hold the phone, then went to the back office with it to show all his colleagues. 10 minutes later he came back with it.</p> <p>It is safe to say that nothing about me has ever interested so many people as my phone does.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think a single person has seen my phone without making a comment about it. The conversation always, always goes like this: Them: \u201cWhat is that?\u201d Me: \u201cMy phone. Yes, I know, it is small.\u201d Them: \u201cWhy?\u201d Me: \u201cBecause it is so bad that I don\u2019t get addicted to it.\u201d After this, they always stand frozen for a while with their jaw on the floor and a smile signaling reluctant admiration. I find that reaction very interesting. Let me tell you a fictional story to convey this reaction. Imagine two finance bros who compete to be the best during college, but lose contact after graduation. Twenty years later, they meet again. One is now a successful banker (who rarely sees his kids). He learns that the other, his previous rival, moved to Bali and worked in a surf shop. He stands frozen for a while with his jaw on the floor and a smile signaling reluctant admiration. Admiration because he realizes that\u2019s the better path, but reluctant because he does not want to admit that to himself.</p> <p>Similarly, people who see my phone know that their smartphone is not good for them, but they don\u2019t want to admit it because they don\u2019t want to give up the drug they are addicted to.</p> <p>Most people stick to their drug, but some are seriously intrigued, so here is a short review of the phone for these people:</p> <ul> <li>Typing is ok. Short messages, quick notes and search queries are no problem, but I always go to my laptop to write longer messages.</li> <li>Two-finger zooming on maps is hard with such a small screen.</li> <li>I use a third-party minimalist homescreen launcher. This makes the phone very laggy at times (I never had this problem with my previous Android phones).</li> <li>Battery is ok. Worse than an iPhone, but you use the phone less so it is not an issue.</li> <li>The camera is bad. I still take pictures to capture memories, but never with the expectation to get a beautiful picture.</li> <li>It\u2019s cheap (~$200).</li> <li>Precise localization in Google Maps is bad.</li> <li>Music listening is no problem. You can download Spotify and Bluetooth works. Even a headphone jack!</li> <li>There\u2019s a fingerprint sensor, but it is very bad. But remember, it is still a smartphone, so all apps on the Play Store work. This is a double edged sword - some willpower is still needed. It was named one of the top 100 best inventions of 2025 by Times Magazine, but I don\u2019t really know why.</li> </ul> <p>My life is much better without what today\u2019s smartphones can offer. And since there is very little innovation here, with the yearly upgrades getting smaller and smaller, I don\u2019t think I will ever use a normal smartphone again. Maybe some new type of device that replaces what we use the phone for today could do it, but until then, I\u2019m happy with my Jelly Star.</p> <p>Follow me on <a href=\"https://x.com/lukaspet\">X</a> or subscribe via <a href=\"https://lukaspetersson.com/feed.xml\">RSS</a> or <a href=\"https://lukaspet.substack.com/\">Substack</a> to stay updated.</p> <p>Thanks to Sebbi Fodor, August Ereus and Esben Kran for feedback &lt;3</p>"

                "<p><strong>Dream a Bit.</strong> Nothing innovative was created by committee. You have to stumble on that odd idea at 3:15a and recognize that you&#8217;ve never seen it before. Maybe no one has seen it. Let it bump around your head a bit. Stare at it from a couple of different angles. Do whatever you do to let it stew, but pitch Jason at some point. Pitch him because he&#8217;s just as crazy as you, and he won&#8217;t shut it down because he knows what you know: innovation is a fight. He&#8217;ll raise an eyebrow when you make no sense, but he&#8217;ll still ask insightful questions. Keep talking with him. Soon, he&#8217;ll believe more than you.</p>\n<p><strong>Ask for Help.</strong> Nothing innovative was created by a committee, but it does require a team. You can see the blast radius of your idea, but you need Laura because scale requires not just a team, but an understandable process to drive that team. You need help. Maybe it isn&#8217;t Laura, but it is most certainly someone who is definitely not you. In fact, the more they aren&#8217;t you, the better. The more their vision and values differ from yours, the higher the chance of success.</p>\n<p><strong>Set Clear Expectations.</strong> Nothing innovative was created without the team understanding the vision. Explain the vision; it&#8217;s better if it starts as a smaller, palatable, tractable idea. Walk through the pitch and the draft of the strategy. Ask Terrance. His tolerance for ambiguity is zero, and he will explain why we can&#8217;t set reasonable expectations with this pitch. Someone once said, &#8220;Feedback is a gift,&#8221; and they were right. By clearly setting measurable and objective expectations, we can start. The act of starting is more important than the vision being perfect.</p>\n<p><strong>Do Your Best to Exceed Expectations.</strong> Nothing compelling was created by a team meeting expectations. Once you&#8217;ve begun, you&#8217;ll see progress, but key decision points will show up, and you&#8217;ll need to decide: Do more? Do less? Cut our losses? Admit defeat? Ask Stewart. He is unencumbered by the constraints of reality. Stewart understands that the art of creation involves:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Being an expert on the situation in front of us.</strong> Do you know what experts sound like? They sound like they fucking know what they are talking about. Experts make the fakers sound like they just read the latest summarization of ChatGPT: vapid, empty, obvious, and sloppy data.</li>\n<li><strong>Ignoring the constraints of time and resources.</strong> Do you want to know how to piss off just about everyone? Ignore objective reality. Ignore the structure that gives everyone purpose. The question is: are you trying to build something new or not?</li>\n<li><strong>Diving into the problem with expert opinions and a plan that most folks don&#8217;t believe</strong>. Your degree of discomfort with this plan tells me everything I need to know, not just about its viability, but its potential impact.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Do the Work.</strong> Nothing compelling was ever built without many days of drama-free productivity. Ask anyone on the team. We do our best work when we can focus. The Drama People<img alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /> trade in drama, and sometimes we need them to highlight and address brokenness, but if the The Drama People<img alt=\"\u2122\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /> are running the show, we&#8217;re not working, we&#8217;re worrying. You&#8217;re going to need Sarah \u2014 she has zero tolerance for drama. She&#8217;ll stare drama straight in the eye until it realizes its pointlessness.</p>\n<p><strong>Shit Happens. Deal with It.</strong> Nothing compelling was built by a team of talented people who didn&#8217;t deal with the shit. Yeah, I wrote shit. It&#8217;s a swear word. If this word makes you uncomfortable, I have more bad news. So much more than bad shit is going to stand between you and building the next thing. Ask Maria, she&#8217;ll tell you. She&#8217;s seen the shit and she knows better than most that bullshit kills culture, it promises unachievable insanity, and it is incapable of delivering the impossible.</p>\n<p>Deal with it. No one believes you can do it; most everyone only believe what they have already seen, and if what you were trying to build was obvious, it would&#8217;ve already been done. The obstacles, the shit, are the clearest sign you are onto something. Repeat the loop. Ask for help, reset expectations, exceed those reset expectations, and prepare for more shit. It&#8217;s coming.</p>\n<p><strong>Admit You Are Wrong.</strong> Nothing compelling was created by people who didn&#8217;t fuck up. See, well, you actually screwed up. That was a bad decision, and it took us down an expensive and inefficient path to a dead end. You know how I know? Eliza told me, and, more importantly, I listened. Listen to the people you trust. You&#8217;ve been selling well-intentioned ego-based inspiration for a while now, and if you don&#8217;t listen to smart humans who tell you the truth, you will achieve an impressive nothing or, worse, a mediocre something.</p>\n<p><strong>Fearlessly Alter the Plan.</strong> Nothing compelling was created by people who didn&#8217;t change everything. It&#8217;s not just a bad idea and a dead end;  it&#8217;s a deeply flawed strategy that can not succeed. This will feel like failure until you talk to Erik. He has no skin in the game, he speaks the truth, and, most importantly, he knows how to speak to you. This combination of attributes dispels the sense of failure and allows you to move forward. He&#8217;s not going to fix it; that&#8217;s your job.</p>\n<p>So.</p>\n<p><strong>Dream a Bit.</strong>  Nothing innovative was created by not trying again. Ask Jason again. He has time.</p>"

They say there will be privacy toggles, but of course then everyone knows you have something to hide, and they\u2019ll highlight that you did it. I\u2019m mostly in support of this, as it should help control various bot and astroturfing problems. I think that\u2019s worth the cost.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/nikitabier/status/1979994223224209709\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The plan to avoid penalizing Twitter links</a> is that when you click on a link in the iOS app it will keep the post itself accessible on the bottom of the screen so that you can easily like, repost or respond to the original post while you read. I guess this is a marginal improvement?</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you could do these things more often with tweets that have links or longer articles, especially the likes and retweets.</p>\n<p>The unfortunate natural pattern is that if you provide a witty comment, the barrier to liking it is low. Whereas if you provide actual value in the form of a link or Twitter article, or you read something on Substack, the threshold for liking it is \u2018I actually read the damn thing and not only liked it but didn\u2019t have any issues with anything in it, and also remembered to like it afterwards\u2019 which makes it highly unlikely.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I\u2019m going to make a request: If you think the world would be better off if more people read the link or article on Twitter, then like the post with the link or article. If not, not. Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/more-streaming-video-is-bad\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The bulk of \u2018social media\u2019 is now actually short form television</a> that uses an algorithm. This, as Matthew Yglesias notes, is bad. Short form algorithmic video is bad news. Social media as originally intended, where you are social and consume various media from people you are social with, is a mixed bag, but the new thing is terrible. Regular television has big downsides, but also advantages. This seems obviously much worse, and I\u2019ve said it before but it bears repeating.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/tszzl/status/1981549585656066118\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Xi views TikTok as \u2018spiritual opium\u2019 rather than something important</a>, is totally fine with that, and is allowing the TikTok sale as a bargaining chip.</p>\n<p>What happens if you start a fresh Twitter account using a VPN and the For You page? <a href=\"https://x.com/BumrahBachi/status/1987565617483051126\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Soren Kierkegaard found (pre-election) a 4:1 ratio of right to left wing tweets</a>.

It\u2019s also clearly willful. No one has been charged under the ADA before, but violations carry a 2 year jail term. Statute of limitations is 5 years.</p>\n<p>Under the Constitution and under the ADA, it is illegal to spend money without funding for that purpose. The president may not spend money to do something unless there\u2019s actually money to carry it out and that action is expressly allowed.</p>\n<p>\u2026 Military pay is appropriated one year at a time, with a one-year period of availability. The fiscal year ended on September 30th, and we did not pass new appropriations bills (the government is shut down), so there\u2019s no money available to pay the troops (or to do lots of things).</p>\n<p>\u2026 [various technical reasons what they\u2019re doing is very not legal] \u2026</p>\n<p>\u2026 And the craziest part is this was needless. Congress would\u2019ve passed a military pay bill with near unanimous support! Congressional Ds have been begging Rs to bring a bill to pay the military to the floor! But Johnson refuses to gavel in because he doesn\u2019t want an Epstein vote.</p>\n<p>So just how bad is this? I got a text from an appropriator friend saying \u201cThe Republic has fallen. Pack it in.\u201d</p>\n<p>I think there are five levels of potential badness here. Once you\u2019ve decided to violate the ADA, you\u2019re only bound by self-imposed limitations. But depending on what the White House is self-imposing, this can range from \u201cBAD\u201d to \u201cThe Republic has fallen, pack it in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026 Taken together w/ impoundments, this\u2019d break everything. The president is claiming the power to not spend money he doesn\u2019t want to and now also to spend money where it\u2019s not allowed. And SCOTUS might say no one has standing to stop him. That would make him an appropriations king.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In this case everyone agrees you pay the troops and the money can be reconciled (if it hasn\u2019t been already) so the de facto fig leaf is \u2018it is common knowledge this would have been approved\u2019 but that\u2019s not a norm you can rely on in this spot, the violations of principles here are rather egregious, and once you do it once what stops it happening again? What stops them from spending any and all public funds on whatever the hell they feel like?</p>\n<p>In general, we follow a pattern of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A rule is broken that, if fully and properly exploited, would mean the Republic has fallen, and it\u2019s time to pack it in.</li>\n<li>Things get a little bit worse but the thing is not exploited maximally.</li>\n<li>The Republic does not fall and we do not pack it in.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So we can do things like have unidentified masked people kidnapping citizens off the street and acting like this is fine, we can sink boats in international waters without trial or a declaration of war, have relatives of the president make a billion in crypto, have the Department of Justice selectively prosecute personal enemies on direct presidential orders,<a href=\"https://x.com/JHWeissmann/status/1982203712287265191\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> impose punitive tarriffs on one of our most reliable, friendly and important trading partners</a> because of dislike of an advertisement, pardon or <a href=\"https://x.com/jamiedupree/status/1979310672916943220\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">give clemency to ten Republican congressmen convicted of corruption style crimes including actual George Santos</a>, weaponize the IRS to go after opposition groups, actively work to destroy vaccinations and PEPFAR and for some reason tylenol, <a href=\"https://x.com/CGasparino/status/1981496719863955913\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">warn major media companies to sell to the correct bidder</a> or else they won\u2019t approve the deal, outright demand $230 million from the treasury for his personal account right in the open, and so on and so on, and yet things are mostly normal.</p>\n<p>For now.

I think the actual limiting factor here is mostly time.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Will Manidis: with the exception of museum quality/rareness, antique prices have fallen off a cliff over the past 10 years. you can decorate your home like a 18th century royal with pieces unthinkable 99% of humans across history, but instead you live amongst minimalist ikea slop</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/david_perell/status/1982851789150933024\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">David Perell:</a> I\u2019ve been interviewing people who have beautiful homes about how they decorated them, and the biggest surprise is how they almost all insist that good design is more about taste than money.</p>\n<p>Yes, it costs more to buy a great sofa than a bad one. But there are plenty of millionaires living in homes that feel like an airport lounge.</p>\n<p>The actual limiting factor is taste and time. The taste to know what looks good and the time it takes to find what you\u2019re looking for. What\u2019s key is that the second-hand furniture market is quite inefficient.</p>\n<p>To be sure, there is a spectrum: at one end, you have thrift stores (cheap, chaotic, and unvetted). At the other, you have Sotheby\u2019s (curated, clean, and highly vetted). The sweet spot is somewhere in the middle.</p>\n<p>So how do you find pockets of glorious inefficiency?</p>\n<p>One way is to make friends with people who own antique shops. I have a friend in San Francisco who knows a few collectors in town. They know her taste, and when something comes in that matches her style, they call her. And because of this, she never has to wait 17 weeks for a backordered couch from CB2.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the key point: If you have a strong sense of taste and understand the game, you\u2019ll consistently spend less to design a house that feels alive and uniquely yours.</p>\n<p>Good design, it turns out, is a byproduct of taste and attention, not money.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/Spyzguyz/status/1982870723061297208\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Speiser</a>: In NYC and the Hudson Valley there are numerous vintage and antique furniture stores selling great stuff at reasonable prices.

But when I look over at our IKEA-style drawers in this room do I wish they were old school?

To get the handyman market to clear here, you would need to be able to summon someone as easily as with an Uber, and the total cost per successful repair would need to be kept at roughly $100, so yeah, not going to happen in New York City.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/DegenRolf/status/1979195756012785941\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">In a forecasting competition</a>, evaluators failed to find better predictors more persuasive. They did notice the better predictors showed signs of intelligence, rationality and motivation, but this was counteracted by others presenting with higher confidence. This suggests an easy fix if people care to get it right.</p>\n<p>Listed under bad news because I wouldn\u2019t want this playbook to be the right book, Andreesen and Collision discuss Elon Musk\u2019s management style.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/pnegahdar/status/1981830714279833760\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Bearly AI and Parham</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Engineer-first organizations and find truth by speaking with those working on the floor (avoid management layers).</li>\n<li>Every week, find the most important bottleneck at a company and parachute in to fix it.</li>\n<li>Keep model of all engineering and business moving parts in his head (obviously, not many can do this).</li>\n<li>Create cult of personality in and outside of the company (continually drive attention, without marketing or PR).</li>\n<li>Pick single most import target metric for business at a time (eg. SpaceX = $ per kilo to orbit)</li>\n<li>Constantly create urgency (which often shortens time horizons for projects).</li>\n<li>Focus on capital efficiency</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My theory is this is all very much a package deal if you try do more than about two of them. If you try to do half these things, it won\u2019t work. You have to do most or all of them, or try a different approach, and as noted few people can do #3 and I would also add #4, or #2 in any useful sense. You need to be able to keep all the pieces in place, do the engineering work and also create a widespread cult of personality to justify that you keep f***ing with everyone and everything and making everyone\u2019s lives miserable all the time.</p>\n<p>Looking back on MetaMed in this light, I think we often fell into the \u2018do many but not enough of these things and not hardcore and consistently enough\u2019 bucket (not intentionally, I wasn\u2019t modeling on Musk at all), and that\u2019s one high level explanation of why it didn\u2019t work. If I\u2019d been able to go harder in the key missing places, then it plausibly would have worked to the extent the plan was workable at all (or pivoted).</p>\n<h4>The Rage of the Plastic Straw Ban</h4>\n<p>Why do people care so much about bans on plastic straws? Let us count the ways.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Gearoid Reidy: McDonald\u2019s Japan is finally abandoning its unpopular paper straws, replacing them with lids that diners can drink from directly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/no_on_15/status/1982768464793403655\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Sam D\u2019Amico</a>: A nine year old wrote a \u201cstudy\u201d for a school project and we all ended up drinking glue for over a decade.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/no_on_15/status/1982768464793403655\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">no_on_15:</a> I will never understand how people became so distressed over paper straws.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/caesararum/status/1982776582453235929\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">caesararum</a>: as \u201cpeople\u201d lemme count the ways</p>\n<p>&#8211; paper straws are inferior at their main job</p>\n<p>&#8211; they fall apart within minutes of use &#8211; they impart taste to what you\u2019re drinking</p>\n<p>&#8211; there\u2019s evidence they leach more and worse chemicals than plastic</p>\n<p>&#8211; they have a weird texture when you put your mouth on them</p>\n<p>&#8211; the seam and softness and weird pliability _feel_ off</p>\n<p>&#8211; ocean plastics have never been about single use plastics in the west</p>\n<p>&#8211; legislators burned up time, political capital, and credibility advancing these laws</p>\n<p>&#8211; we\u2019re probably going to find out plastic straws use less total GHG anyway</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/KelseyTuoc/status/1982875758906523723\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Kelsey Piper:</a> One more for your list: My toddler absolutely cannot use a paper straw at all. She bites it a bit, which plastic can handle and which destroys paper immediately.</p>\n<p>Shea Levy (quoting Marcel Dumas): One more: The only answer to \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal\u201d is \u201cfine, then let me win.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kelsey Piper: I think part of why the straws are such a flashpoint is because they\u2019re such a pure example of making things worse and then going \u2018why do you care so much? get a life\u2019 when people observe that now their lives are worse.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Kelsey is spot on. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s such a huge deal, it\u2019s that every time it happens it is so obvious that your life has been made worse essentially out of spite and stupidity and innumeracy, and every time it rubs this in your face. And then they lie to you, and say the paper straws are fine. They\u2019re not fine, they are worse than nothing. That\u2019s why it fills me with rage, even though I cannot remember the last time I used a straw.</p>\n<h4>Affordability Politics</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/11/i-worry-about-affordability-politics.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Tyler Cowen worries about \u2018affordability politics</a>.\u2019 He\u2019s not against the abstract concept, but the ways people respond to lack of affordability don\u2019t correspond to the good ways to create real affordability. We respond in such spots by restricting supply and subsidizing demand instead of expanding supply, so we find a problem and then go make it worse.</p>\n<p>So yes, I worry about this too. In general, any time people say \u2018the market has failed to provide what we want\u2019 you are not going to like the proposed intervention.</p>\n<h4>Monks In The Casino</h4>\n<p>Recommended: <a href=\"https://www.derekthompson.org/p/the-monks-in-the-casino\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Derek Thompson writes about The Monks In The Casino</a>, as in the young men in America who don\u2019t live nominally healthy and ascetic lives in many senses but stay home, isolated, in front of computer monitors, without even feeling lonely, often addicted to things like porn and gambling as the economy looks increasingly like a casino. They take financial risks online, but no risks in physical space. Betting is getting easier while living gets harder.</p>\n<p>I may say more later, for now read the whole thing.</p>\n<h4>Procrastination Is Bad Actually</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/zencephalon/status/1981446740780654746\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">People will attempt to justify anything</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Zen: \u201cI procrastinated for days and then it only took 20m when I sat down to do it <img alt=\"\ud83d\ude2d\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f62d.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" />\u201d</p>\n<p>Give your system more credit.

Are there times when you actually need more subconscious processing? I mean I guess but mostly that\u2019s the flimsiest of excuses. Do the thing already.</p>\n<h4>Many Successful People Adjust Behaviors More</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/robinhanson/status/1982810283195191373\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Do top people vary behaviors more? Where is causation here?</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>Robin Hanson: Top people have more conflicting stories about them as both nice and jerks. Because, I think, their behavior is in fact more context dependent. As that is in fact a more winning social strategy.</p>\n<p>Triangulation: Also: high status attracts both detractors and sycophants.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In most situations for most people, even top people, I believe nice is correct regardless, jerk is a mistake, this pays dividends over time.</p>\n<p>As you get to the top the jerk stories get amplified a lot more. You do have to be willing to be hard nosed in some situations, and there are those who are more willing to consider you a jerk because you\u2019re successful. That doesn\u2019t mean be a jerk, even to someone with no power.</p>\n<p>However, there is a particular strategy based around maximal incentive gradients, and its final form only works at the top. Trump is the avatar of this.</p>\n<p>One minute you\u2019re the best, the next you\u2019re the worst, and then you\u2019re back to the best. So you have maximum reason to be sure you\u2019re the best and not the worst.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re high enough in relative status and power or usefulness that people still want to deal with you at all, this can be very powerful. If you\u2019re not, it doesn\u2019t work, because no one will want to associate with you at all. So you can only deploy this strategy to the extent, and in the contexts, where people have no choice but to engage.</p>\n<p>In some places there\u2019s an equilibrium that drives such strategies out, and I prefer such spaces. But the top of business and politics reward it.</p>\n<h4>Take The Money And Run</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/oscredwin/status/1986977146586177920\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Venezuelan President Maduro did not actually say</a> (to our knowledge) that if the US gives him amnesty, removes his bounty and gives a comfortable exile he\u2019ll leave office. But let\u2019s suppose that he made this offer. Should we take it?</p>\n<blockquote><p>Andrew Rettek: It\u2019s like the trolley problem but instead of one person it\u2019s a bag of money and instead of 5 people it\u2019s an entire country.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In terms of causal decision theory, of the direct consequences, obviously yes. You greatly improve an entire nation in exchange for a tiny bag of money. Great deal.</p>\n<p>Alas, that is not the full deal. The deal also is that future dictators will know they likely have a similar option, even if they are pretty terrible. This goes both ways.</p>\n<p>First the good news:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If others take similar deals, you can rescue other countries similarly.</li>\n<li>If others know they have this option, they can invest fewer resources in regime stability and buying off loyalty of their chain of command, since failure to maintain power is now often much less bad.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Then the bad news:</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>This makes being a dictator a much, much better deal.</li>\n<li>This encourages them to maintain strong bargaining positions.</li>\n<li>This also gives them more incentive to steal money and squirrel it away.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We face similar hostage situations all the time at smaller scale. We strike a balance. We do often pay ransoms, negotiate for hostages and so forth. We also have limits. I think in general we are too willing to negotiate, and should more often tell such folks to go to hell and accept that this particular situation will often end poorly as a result.</p>\n<p>On the dictator level it is less clear. In this case I would take the deal, if it came not only with him leaving but with a transition to democracy. Indeed, one could make a conditional deal, where his immunity depends on the transition.</p>\n<h4>Work Harder</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ATabarrok/status/1983591259605221477\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">If the job interview was too easy, perhaps you don\u2019t want the job</a>. Worthwhile interviews are two ways, you want to be sure you will have good colleagues who work hard and the job will challenge you, and that is a fit for your interests. I the interview is too easy, you probably could have aimed higher. The paper here finds that the perceptions from a job interview are indeed informative about the job.</p>\n<p>When I left my interview at Jane Street Capital, I was very excited to work there. When I did my other finance interview? Not so much.</p>\n<h4>Work Smarter</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/tszzl/status/1982929076609528177\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">I strongly agree with Roon here</a>, for most (but not all) classes of intellectual tasks. For physical tasks it will probably suck to be you doing it but in terms of productivity you can 996 (work 12 hours a day 6 days a week) all you want.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Roon: most likely you will not get the most out of yourself by 996ing. generally that\u2019s a way to destroy the self. I subscribe to the Ferris bueller\u2019s day off theology that says you\u2019ll probably get the most out of yourself by being maximally uninhibited so the universe sings with you.</p>\n<p>it\u2019s more important to Go To War when dharma is calling, and you will know when it happens, than to 996 as a permanent way of life. for people like elon [musk] and sam [altman] that may be every day but it\u2019s probably not yours.</p></blockquote>\n<h4>Anti-Suicide Chairs</h4>\n<p>They are pitching us\u2026 <a href=\"https://chairdeskexpert.com/guide/anti-suicide-chairs/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">anti-suicide chairs?</a> It seems a lot of the argument here is literally \u2018the chair doesn\u2019t help you physically kill yourself\u2019 and a bunch of weird claims about things like \u2018creating a supportive and inclusive environment and reducing stigma and encouraging dialogue\u2019 and I\u2019m calling full BS on all that.</p>\n<p>Indeed, my guess is the best thing you can do for people in trouble via chairs is to get them actually comfy chairs, so they feel better.</p>\n<h4>The Great American Songbook</h4>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/wdavidmarx/status/1977162349107900770?s=46\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">David Marx</a>: Rolling Stone <a href=\"https://t.co/EHiNBMD1Y2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">compiled a \u201cThe 250 Greatest Songs of the 21st Century\u201d list</a>, and while the specific inclusions are debatable, it gives a sense of the 21st century canon as it\u2019s forming.</p>\n<p>I noticed a bias towards the early 2000s so I ran the numbers.</p>\n<p>I tallied the number of entries per year, and there\u2019s a steady and linear decline, with a very clear dip in the last half of the Aughts.

If you\u2019d made a similar list from the 20th century, I expect I\u2019d have known most of the songs. When I browsed this list, I was running at maybe 15%, and that\u2019s simply to know them, not like them. To be fair to the list, the ones I did recognize seemed like mostly good picks.</p>\n<p>Tanmay Khale emailed Tyler Cowen to suggest that modern songs <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/10/tanmay-khale-on-the-decline-in-iconic-songs-over-time-from-my-email.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=tanmay-khale-on-the-decline-in-iconic-songs-over-time-from-my-email\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">are suffering from unfair regularization of scores</a>, where they are compared to other modern songs or to how much better they are than prior efforts, so they don\u2019t look great. I agree there is some of this going on, our standards to break through are higher, but I think that\u2019s more about the low hanging fruit being picked, you don\u2019t need to be \u2018better\u2019 so much as you need to be original, which is increasingly hard. There\u2019s some amount of better necessary to break through into a canon to overcome familiarity barriers, but also people can get really familiar with big hits quickly.</p>\n<p>Music is different from sports here because you don\u2019t only play against simultaneous competition.

On their own AppleTV+ is $13/month and Peacock is $10/$15 depending on if you accept ads, so that\u2019s a deep discount. That\u2019s in addition to the $30 HBO/Hulu/Disney+ package, which is also strong. You should have Amazon Prime anyway, so throw in Netflix and YouTube Premium, Paramount+ is optional, and you\u2019re all set unless you watch sports.</p>\n<p>The problem is you\u2019re then very tempted to rotate between packages. The long term equilibrium is presumably one package with all of it, so you aren\u2019t constantly either toggling between services or feeling bad about not doing so. Alternatively, they should up their yearly subscription discount game, which I would also find acceptable.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile there\u2019s a war. Disney owns ESPN and ABC, as well as Hulu and Fubo.

The obvious deal would have been Netflix, why not unify the core broadcast with Drive to Survive, but I don\u2019t mind what they ended up doing. Apple is also a powerful ally.</p>\n<p>I think AppleTV+ is exactly on point in saying it wants to own entire entire sports.

Also the transition to the NIL era has invalidated many past strategies, making previously excellent coaches no longer good, see Dabo Swinney (probably).</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset\">\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"354\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iPMg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a3b0461-de7c-4b02-923d-7fd3b22de46c_436x354.png\" title=\"\" width=\"436\" /></p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>It still does not make sense to me. You might not love the coach but at an 80%+ discount you think you can do better? You need to be firing them in the middle of the season like this? It\u2019s madness, I tell you.</p>\n<p>I think with Franklin and Kelly in particular the problem is that they did great jobs in recruiting, so expectations got very high, then the teams didn\u2019t deliver and they thought let\u2019s axe the coach. Big mistake.</p>\n<p>The other note is that if the coaches get rehired then the cost will be a lot less, and one expects the top names on this list to get new jobs. LSU and Penn State might not want them, but plenty of schools would love Kelly or Franklin. I\u2019d love to get Franklin for Wisconsin, it seems like a perfect fit.</p>\n<p>Whereas one I definitely agree with here is Mike Gundy. Gundy is a prime example of a previously excellent coach who is adrift in the new era, you have to cut your losses.</p>\n<p>One obvious suggestion is to tie the buyouts directly to the record. You say, okay, if we fire you without cause you are owed 85% of the contract, but if you have X losses or fail to hit some milestone, then that\u2019s cause. Seems simple enough, and the coaches at this level have big egos and don\u2019t expect to fail.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/SethBurn/status/1981018286302085305\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The NFL might be getting ready to move to the 4th and 15 alternative to onside kicks</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Jonathan Jones: NFL EVP Troy Vincent told team owners today that it may be time to look at the fourth-and-15 proposal that has been offered as an alternate to the onside kick. The lack of recoveries on onside has disappointed the league.</p>\n<p>Seth Burn: This will be a disaster if teams can bait the refs into giving cheap defensive holding or DPI flags.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You want to calibrate about how often the team can convert. Right now the onside kick recovery rate is too low. The yards to go can be adjusted to taste, and with many yards to go you don\u2019t have to give the refs an excuse.</p>\n<p>If the refs are actively looking to throw a flag in order to extend the game, and are basically cheating in this particular spot, that\u2019s a different problem. I presume they wouldn\u2019t do it because this is bad for the game.</p>\n<p>Also the cheap automatic first downs from such penalties should be clamped down on in any case. There are any number of rules changes to fix this, the most obvious being that there can be two types of such flags, the way there\u2019s both running into and roughing the kicker, and you don\u2019t get an automatic first down unless it\u2019s flagrant.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/the-nba-gambling-scandal-explained\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Nate Silver offers his thoughts on the NBA betting scandal.</a> Our perspectives on this are broadly similar. Sports betting can be good fun and good business, and the context of odds can enhance sports, but the current regime of legalized sports gambling on your phone is terrible and current books do not deserve your sympathy.</p>\n<p>They especially don\u2019t deserve sympathy for when their whales (big customers getting taken for huge amounts that are allowed to do basically anything for huge limits without questions) end up becoming beards (as in placing bets on behalf of actual professional gamblers) and bet $100k or more on an obscure player prop. They\u2019re choosing to do game theoretically unsound things and taking calculated risks. If you\u2019re gonna play with fire then sometimes you\u2019re gonna get burned.</p>\n<p>My view of player props is that people who seek them out should be allowed to have their fun, sure why not, it\u2019s cool info and a cool mini-game and in some cases it\u2019s even a loss leader (since the wise person betting can pick off your mistakes and passes otherwise), but that the sportsbooks pushing them (and also pushing parlays) on recreational players is predatory behavior. And if they raise the limits on the props, especially on obscure players, that\u2019s at their own risk.</p>\n<p>I also don\u2019t have much sympathy for the recreational gamblers who take the other side of insider NBA bets. The NBA lines are, as Nate says, full of information about injuries and player usage and intent to tank, often not publicly known, to the point where this is the main thing driving lines away from where they naively \u2018should\u2019 be, and where most NBA fans at a sports bar could tell you what the line \u2018should\u2019 be if everyone potentially available was healthy and playing. Evaluating and tracking injuries is the main skill. That\u2019s the game you\u2019re playing. Either play it, or don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>One place I disagree is where Nate mentions in his point #7 that if we banned FanDuel and DraftKings that 70% of that volume might move offshore rather than vanishing. I agree some percentage would move if there were no alternatives, but I would be utterly shocked if it was on the order of 70%. All the advertising would be gone. All the integration with media and teams and stadiums would be gone. Funding would be non-trivial again, as Nate notes you\u2019d largely need to use crypto. You wouldn\u2019t have an app with an optimized UI and wouldn\u2019t be getting all the hyper aggressive customized push notifications on your phone. The entire context would change. No, it wouldn\u2019t go fully back to the old level of activity, but it would drop a lot.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.natesilver.net/p/the-nfl-has-entered-the-scorigami\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The broader NFL shift is that not only are kickers getting better</a> (as per this very fun article from Nate Silver), offenses are getting better across the board and also making better decisions, and the reason we don\u2019t notice the extent of this is that drives are taking up more time so the scores don\u2019t fully reflect the shift.</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset\">\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"856\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!h3Pc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc7088ad-9074-4e88-b67c-bc019538442e_1119x856.png\" width=\"1119\" /></p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/SethBurn/status/1985802686449766694\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">When NFL teams depart</a> from draft consensus on player value they consistently do worse. So teams should use the consensus board for player value, except for when they have particular private information (such as on injuries), especially teams like the Jets with poor track records.</p>\n<p>You do still have to account for positional value, and what you in particular need because the trading market is illiquid. It\u2019s fine to make small departures based on what you do and don\u2019t need, but that should be it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1990222205574381748\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">I actually do understand the calls for capping concession prices at stadiums</a>.</p>\n<p>Lindsay Owens here claims that teams are outright making mistakes, that in Atlanta raising ticket prices while lowering concession prices increased sales volume and revenue and fan satisfaction. I buy it.</p>\n<p>My read is that the higher concession prices raise marginally more revenue, but that you don\u2019t want to be at the top of the revenue curve on this because the bad feeling of overpaying too much not only drives fans away from purchases, it makes the overall experience worse, as the stadium experience is Out To Get You. What you want is to be able to basically order whatever you want and not feel bad about it, and the team should want this for you too.</p>\n<p>It makes the overall experience much better, keeps people coming back, and turns them into long term fans. In general, teams should be doing less short term profit maximizing at their stadiums. I bet that on most current margins this outweighs the value of the price discrimination.</p>\n<p>This is not the same as requiring \u2018all-in pricing\u2019 on tickets, which I think is just good, and yes you lose the ability to do price discrimination which in theory leaves something on the table. However, I think there are enough differences that I do not want to \u2018force them into a good move\u2019 via law.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Sometimes People Cheat At Poker</h4>\n<p>Nate also discusses the poker cheating scandal, where I\u2019m happy to defer to him and his notes match my understanding. Poker is fun, either with your buddies or at a casino, but if you\u2019re not at a casino avoid raked games where the host turns a profit, there\u2019s too much cheating risk and risk of involvement with people who are bad news. If you get invited to a home game, don\u2019t go unless you understand why you\u2019re invited.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d highlight the note that cheaters are usually extremely greedy and unable to keep their cheating subtle, as per Nate\u2019s #39. If they were capable of only \u2018cheating small\u2019 then they wouldn\u2019t be cheating, so if you pay attention you can usually sense things aren\u2019t right even if you can\u2019t prove it.</p>\n<p>Hence the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/13lbu55/chauncey_allegedly_scammed_people_out_of/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ability of Matt Berkey to call out the Billups game as rigged</a> two years ago. If you listen to the podcast clip, everything was the opposite of subtle, with players constantly making plays that make absolutely no sense unless cheating is involved.</p>\n<p>Also, as per #40, it doesn\u2019t matter if you think the game is good enough you can win anyway, don\u2019t play in a game where you\u2019re being cheated, period.</p>\n<p>A similar phenomenon exists in Magic: The Gathering. If someone is cheating, they\u2019re almost always highly suspicious. The problem is that unlike poker you often don\u2019t choose who you play your Magic matches against, so you can be stuck against a likely cheater who hasn\u2019t formally been caught yet.</p>\n<h4>Opportunity Knocks</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/moreisdifferent/status/1988650405258297385\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">New York City will</a> have its <a href=\"https://t.co/VDxHZgpF9T\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Secular Solstice and Mega-Meetup</a> on the weekend of December 20th.
