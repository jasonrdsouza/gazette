The eyeballs actually rotate clockwise or counterclockwise within the eye socket. This keeps the pupils oriented to the horizontal.</p>\n\n  <p>[\u2026]</p>\n\n  <p>To test out this theory, I took photos of Lucky the goat\u2019s head in two different positions, down and up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><br />\n(2) <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adu1052\">Novel color via stimulation of individual photoreceptors at population scale</a> (h/t Benny)</p>\n\n<p>The cones in our eyes all have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell\">overlapping spectra</a>. So even if you look at just a single frequency of light, more than one type of cone will be stimulated.</p>\n\n<p>So, obviously, what we need to do is identify individual cone cell types on people\u2019s retinas and then selectively stimulate them with lasers so that people can experience never-before-seen colors.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Attempting to activate M cones exclusively is shown to elicit a color beyond the natural human gamut, formally measured with color matching by human subjects. They describe the color as blue-green of unprecedented saturation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When I was a kid and I was bored in class, I would sometimes close my eyes and try to think of a \u201cnew color\u201d. I never succeeded, and in retrospect I think I have aphantasia.</p>\n\n<p>But does this experiment suggest it <em>is</em> actually possible to imagine new colors? I\u2019m fascinated that our brains have the ability to <em>interpret</em> these non-ecological signals, and applaud all such explorations of qualia space.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n(3) <a href=\"https://www.ies.org/fires/simplifying-melanopsin-metrology/\">Simplifying Melanopsin Metrology</a> (h/t Chris &amp; <a href=\"https://alexholcombe.substack.com/\">Alex</a>)</p>\n\n<p>When reading about <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/blue-light/\">blue-blocking glasses</a>, I failed to discover that the effects of light on melatonin don\u2019t seem to be mediated by cones or rods at all. Instead, around 1% of retinal photosensitive cells are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsically_photosensitive_retinal_ganglion_cell\">melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These seem to specifically exist for the purpose of regulating melatonin and circadian rhythms. They have their own <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Overview_of_the_retina_photoreceptors_(b).png\">spectral sensitivity</a>:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/links-3/retina_photoreceptors.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>If you believe that sleep is mediated entirely by these cells, then you\u2019d probably want to block all frequencies above ~550 nm. That would leave you with basically only orange and red light.</p>\n\n<p>However, Chris convinced me that if you want natural melatonin at night, the smart thing is primarily rely on <em>dim</em> lighting, and only secondarily on blocking blue light. Standard \u201cwarm\u201d 2700 K bulbs only reduce blue light to around \u2153 as much. But your eyes can easily adapt to &lt;10% as many lux. If you combine those, blue light is down by ~97%.</p>\n\n<p>The brain doesn\u2019t seem to use these cells for pattern vision at all. Although\u2026</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In work by Zaidi, Lockley and co-authors using a rodless, coneless human, it was found that a very intense 481\u00a0nm stimulus led to some conscious light perception, meaning that some rudimentary vision was realized.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><br />\n(4) <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/inflight-auctions\">Inflight Auctions</a></p>\n\n<p>Airplanes have to guess how much food to bring. So either they waste energy moving around extra food that no one eats, or some people go hungry. So why don\u2019t we have people <em>bid</em> on food, so nothing goes to waste?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I expect passengers would absolutely hate it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><br />\n(5) <a href=\"https://www.atvbt.com/the-good-sides-of-nepotism/\">The Good Sides Of Nepotism</a></p>\n\n<p>Speaking of things people hate, this post gives a theory for why you might rationally prefer to apply nepotism when hiring someone: Your social connections increase the cost of failure for the person you hire. I suspect we instinctively apply this kind of game theory without even realizing we\u2019re doing so.</p>\n\n<p>This seems increasingly important, what with all the AI-generated job applications now attacking AI-automated human resources departments.</p>\n\n<p>My question is: If this theory is correct, can we create other social structures to provide the same benefit in other ways, therefore reducing the returns on nepotism?</p>\n\n<p>Say I want you to hire me, but you\u2019re worried I suck. In principle, I could take $50,000, put it in escrow, and tell you, \u201cIf you hire me, and I actually suck (as judged by an arbiter) then you can burn the $50,000.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sounds horrible, right? But that\u2019s approximately what\u2019s happening if you know I have social connections and/or reputation that will be damaged if I screw up.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n(6) <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Fragment/Text_fragments\">Text fragment links</a></p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve spent decades in the dark ages of the internet, where you could only link to entire webpages or (maybe) particular hidden beacon codes.</p>\n\n<p>But we are now in a new age. You can link to any text on any page. Like this:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/grug#:~:text=phenylalanine\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">https://dynomight.net/grug#:~:text=phenylalanine</code></a></p>\n\n<p>This is not a special feature of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dynomight.net</code>. It\u2019s done by your browser.</p>\n\n<p>I love this, but I can never remember how to type <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">#:~:text=</code>. Well, <em>finally</em>, almost all browsers now also support <em>generating</em> these links. You just highlight some text, right-click, and \u201cCopy Link to Highlight\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>If you go to <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/thanks/\">this page</a> and highlight and right-click on this text:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/links-3/link.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>Then you get <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/thanks/#:~:text=coincidentally%20stabilize\">this link</a>.</p>\n\n<details>\n  \nThis works out of the box in Safari and Chrome-esque browsers. In Firefox (from my cold, dead hands) you currently have to edit a preference.\n\n\n  <ol>\n    <li>type <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">about:config</code> into the address bar</li>\n    <li>paste <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dom.text_fragments.create_text_fragment.enabled</code></li>\n    <li>click the \u201c\u21cc\u201d symbol so that \u201cfalse\u201d changes to \u201ctrue\u201d.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n</details>\n\n<p><br />\n(7) (Not technically a link)</p>\n\n<p>Also, did you know you can link to specific pages of pdf files? For example:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gwern.net/doc/longevity/glp/semaglutide/2023-aroda.pdf#page=8\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">https://gwern.net/doc/longevity/glp/semaglutide/2023-aroda.pdf#page=8</code></a></p>\n\n<p>I just add <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">#page=</code> manually. Chrome-esque browsers, oddly, will do automatically if you right-click and go to \u201cCreate QR Code for this Page\u201d.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n(8) <a href=\"https://caseymilkweed.substack.com/p/response-to-dynomight-on-scribble\">Response to Dynomight on Scribble-based Forecasting</a></p>\n\n<p>Thoughtful counter to some of my math skepticism. I particularly endorse the point in the final paragraph.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n(9) <a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/decision-conditional-prices-reflect\">Decision Conditional Prices Reflect Causal Chances</a></p>\n\n<p>Robin Hanson counters my post on <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/futarchy/\">Futarchy\u2019s fundamental flaw</a>. My candid opinion is that this is a paradigmatic example of a <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/heat/\">\u201cheat mirage\u201d</a>, in that he doesn\u2019t engage with any of the details of my argument, doesn\u2019t specify what errors I supposedly made, and doesn\u2019t seem to commit to any specific assumptions that he\u2019s willing to argue <em>are</em> plausible and <em>would</em> guarantee prices that reflect causal effects. So I don\u2019t really see any way to continue the conversation. But judge for yourself!</p>\n\n<p><br />\n(10) <a href=\"https://manifold.markets/BoltonBailey/futarchys-fundamental-flaw-the-mark\">Futarchy\u2019s fundamental flaw - the market</a></p>\n\n<p>Speaking of which, <a href=\"https://thequantummilkman.substack.com/\">Bolton Bailey</a> set up a conditional prediction market to experimentally test one of the examples I gave where I claimed prediction markets would not reflect causal probabilities.</p>\n\n<p>If you think betting on causal effects is always the right strategy in conditional prediction markets, here\u2019s your chance to make some fake internet currency. The market closes on July 26, 2025. No matter how much you love me, please trade according to your self-interest.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n(11) <a href=\"https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/war-and-peace/louise-maude_aylmer-maude\">War and Peace</a></p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m reading War and Peace. You probably haven\u2019t heard, but it\u2019s really good.</p>\n\n<p>Except the names. Good god, the names. There are a <em>lot</em> of characters, and all the major ones have many names:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Andr\u00e9y</li>\n  <li>Nikol\u00e1evich</li>\n  <li>Bolk\u00f3nski</li>\n  <li>Andr\u00fasha</li>\n  <li>Andr\u00e9</li>\n  <li>Prince Andr\u00e9y</li>\n  <li>Prince Bolk\u00f3nski</li>\n  <li>Prince Andr\u00e9y Nikol\u00e1evich</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Those are all the same person. Try keeping track of all those variants for 100 different characters in a narrative with many threads spanning time and space. Sometimes, the <em>same</em> name refers to <em>different</em> people. And Tolstoy loves to just write \u201cThe Princess\u201d when there are three different princesses in the room.</p>\n\n<p>So I thought, why not use color? Whenever a new character appears, assign them a color, and use it for all name variants for the rest of the text. Even better would be to use color patterns like <span style=\"color: crimson;\">Bol</span><span style=\"color: darkslateblue;\">k\u00f3n</span><span style=\"color: olivedrab;\">ski</span> / <span style=\"color: crimson;\">Prince</span> <span style=\"color: darkslateblue;\">Andr\u00e9y</span> <span style=\"color: olivedrab;\">Nikol\u00e1evich</span>.</p>\n\n<p>This should be easy for AI, right?</p>\n\n<p>I can think of ways to do this, but they would all be painful, due to War and Peace\u2019s length: They involve splitting the text into chunks, having the AI iterate over them while updating some name/color mapping, and then merging everything at the end.</p>\n\n<p>So here\u2019s a challenge: Do you know an <em>easy</em> way to do this? Is there any existing tool that you can give a short description of my goals, and get a full name-colored pdf / html / epub file? (\u201cIf your agent cannot do this, then of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/176254-if-the-rule-you-followed-brought-you-to-this-of\">what use</a> is the agent?\u201d)</p>\n\n<p>Note: It\u2019s critical to give <em>all</em> characters a color. Otherwise, seeing a name without color would be a huge spoiler that they aren\u2019t going to survive very long. It\u2019s OK if some colors are similar.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s also the issue of all the intermingled French. But I find that hard not to admire\u2014Tolstoy was <em>not</em> falling for audience capture.</p>\n\n<p>(And yes, <a href=\"https://www.projectwap.com/\">War and Peace, Simplified Names Edition</a> apparently exists. But I\u2019m in too deep to switch now.)</p>\n\n<p><br />\n(12) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin#Statistics\">Twins</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The human twin birth rate in the United States rose 76% from 1980 through 2009, from 9.4 to 16.7 twin sets (18.8 to 33.3 twins) per 1,000 births. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_people\" title=\"Yoruba people\">Yoruba people</a> have the highest rate of twinning in the world, at 45\u201350 twin sets (90\u2013100 twins) per 1,000 live births possibly because of high consumption of a specific type of yam containing a natural <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoestrogen\" title=\"Phytoestrogen\">phytoestrogen</a> which may stimulate the ovaries to release an egg from each side.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I love this because, like:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/links-3/yams-cartoon.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>(That actually happened. Yams had that conversation and then started making phytoestrogens.)</p>\n\n<p>Apparently, some yams naturally contain the plant hormone <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diosgenin\">diosgenin</a>, which can be chemically converted into various human hormones. And that\u2019s actually how we used to <em>make</em> estrogen, testosterone, etc.</p>\n\n<p>And if you like that, did you know that estrogen medications were historically made from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_estrogens\">urine of pregnant mares</a>? I thought this was awesome, but after reading a bit about how this worked, I doubt the horses would agree. Even earlier, animal ovaries and testes were used. These days, hormones tend to be synthesized without any animal or plant precursor.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re skeptical that more twins would mean higher reproductive fitness, note that yams don\u2019t believe in Algernon Arguments.</p>"

My guess is a slightly better language model would solve most of them&#8230;for all I know, some of the larger image models have already fixed these issues. These are the sorts of problems I expect to go away with a few months of future research.</p></blockquote><p>Commenters objected that this was overly optimistic. AI was just a pattern-matching &#8220;stochastic parrot&#8221;. It would take a deep understanding of grammar to get a prompt exactly right, and that would require some entirely new paradigm beyond LLMs. <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/a-guide-to-asking-robots-to-design/comment/6856811\">For example, from Vitor</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Why are you so confident in this? The inability of systems like DALL-E to understand semantics in ways requiring an actual internal world model strikes me as the very heart of the issue. We can also see this exact failure mode in the language models themselves. They only produce good results when the human asks for something vague with lots of room for interpretation, like poetry or fanciful stories without much internal logic or continuity.</p><p>Not to toot my own horn, but two years ago you were naively saying we'd have GPT-like models scaled up several orders of magnitude (100T parameters) right about now (<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/10/the-obligatory-gpt-3-post/#comment-912798\">https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/10/the-obligatory-gpt-3-post/#comment-912798</a>).</p><p>I'm registering my prediction that you're being equally naive now. Truly solving this issue seems AI-complete to me. I'm willing to bet on this (ideas on operationalization welcome).</p></blockquote><p>So we <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/a-guide-to-asking-robots-to-design/comment/6945486\">made a bet</a>! </p><blockquote><p>All right. My proposed operationalization of this is that on June 1, 2025, if either if us can get access to the best image generating model at that time (I get to decide which), or convince someone else who has access to help us, we'll give it the following prompts:</p><p>1. A stained glass picture of a woman in a library with a raven on her shoulder with a key in its mouth</p><p>2. An oil painting of a man in a factory looking at a cat wearing a top hat</p><p>3. A digital art picture of a child riding a llama with a bell on its tail through a desert</p><p>4. A 3D render of an astronaut in space holding a fox wearing lipstick</p><p>5. Pixel art of a farmer in a cathedral holding a red basketball</p><p>We generate 10 images for each prompt, just like DALL-E2 does. If at least one of the ten images has the scene correct in every particular on 3/5 prompts, I win, otherwise you do. Loser pays winner $100, and whatever the result is I announce it on the blog (probably an open thread). If we disagree, Gwern is the judge.</p></blockquote><p>Some image models of the time refused to draw humans, so we agreed that robots could stand in for humans in pictures that required them.</p><p>In September 2022, I got some good results from Google Imagen and <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/i-won-my-three-year-ai-progress-bet\">announced I had won the three-year bet in three months</a>. Commenters yelled at me, saying that Imagen still hadn&#8217;t gotten them quite right and my victory declaration was premature. The argument blew up enough that Edwin Chen of Surge, an &#8220;RLHF and human LLM evaluation platform&#8221;, stepped in and asked his professional AI data labelling team. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230323051504/https://www.surgehq.ai/blog/dall-e-vs-imagen-and-evaluating-astral-codex-tens-3000-ai-bet\">Their verdict was clear</a>: the AI was bad and I was wrong.

but it&#8217;s an obvious step up in matching the styles, and these were all produced on the first try. In retrospect, it feels like judges were right to dismiss former models, which were sort of blundering about and getting some of them right by coincidence. 4o just works.</p><p>Edwin is presumably still on his yacht, but original contest judge Gwern gave it his seal of approval, saying:</p><blockquote><p>I think I agree he has clearly won the bet. As you say, the images look correct and I'm willing to call the ball 'red' because of the overall yellow tint (good old color constancy).</p></blockquote><h2>In Memoriam: Your Last Set Of Goalposts, Gone But Not Forgotten</h2><p>It&#8217;s probably bad form to write a whole blog post gloating that you won a bet.</p><p>I&#8217;m doing it anyway, because we&#8217;re still having the same debate - whether AI is a &#8220;stochastic parrot&#8221; that will never be able to go beyond &#8220;mere pattern-matching&#8221; into the realm of &#8220;real understanding&#8221;.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/my-bet-ai-size-solves-flubs\">My position has always been</a> that there&#8217;s no fundamental difference: you just move from matching shallow patterns to deeper patterns, and when the patterns are as deep as the ones humans can match, <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/28/meaningful/\">we call that</a> &#8220;real understanding&#8221;. This isn&#8217;t quite right - there&#8217;s a certain form of mental agency that humans still do much better than AIs - but again, it&#8217;s a (large) difference in degree rather than in kind.</p><p>I think this thesis has done well so far. So far, every time people have claimed there&#8217;s something an AI can never do without &#8220;real understanding&#8221;, the AI has accomplished it with better pattern-matching. This was true back in 2020 when GPT-2 failed to add 2+1 and <a href=\"https://thegradient.pub/gpt2-and-the-nature-of-intelligence/\">Gary Marcus declared</a> that scaling had failed and it was time to &#8220;consider investing in different approaches&#8221; (according to Terence Tao, working with AIs is now &#8220;on par with trying to advise a mediocre, but not completely incompetent, static simulation of a graduate student&#8221;). I think progress in AI art tells the same story.</p><p>There is still one discordant note in this story.

So is there still some sense in which the AI is &#8220;just pattern matching&#8221;, but the human is &#8220;really understanding&#8221;? Maybe AIs get better at pattern-matching as they scale up, and eventually they&#8217;ll get good enough for every conceivable reasonably task, but they still won&#8217;t be <em>infinitely </em>good in the same way humans are?</p><p>I think there&#8217;s something going on here where the AI is doing the equivalent of a human trying to keep a prompt in working memory after hearing it once - something we <em>can&#8217;t</em> do arbitrarily well. I admit I can&#8217;t prove this, and it&#8217;s not necessarily intuitive - the AI does have a scratchpad, not to mention it has the prompt in front of it the whole time. It&#8217;s just what makes sense to me based on an analogy with math problems, where AIs often break down at the same point humans do (eg they can multiply two-digit numbers &#8220;in their head&#8221;, but not three-digit numbers). I think this will be solved when we solve agency well enough that the AI can generate plans like drawing part of the picture at a time, then checking the prompt, then doing the rest of it. This may require new skills, like self-reference and planning, which might be added in by hand, emerge naturally from the scaling and training process, or some combination of both.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!H0q2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b9b2a42-14f5-4fac-8bc1-c58842e2403f_1024x1536.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"780\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!H0q2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b9b2a42-14f5-4fac-8bc1-c58842e2403f_1024x1536.png\" width=\"520\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ca6n!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe85ffe8d-6d8c-4d42-9dcd-f415d0d53467_1024x1536.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"765\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ca6n!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe85ffe8d-6d8c-4d42-9dcd-f415d0d53467_1024x1536.png\" width=\"510\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>If you disagree, let me know - maybe we can bet on it!</p><p><em>Thanks to everyone who helped operationalize, judge, and generate images for this bet.
