Let&#8217;s abstract this into &#8220;processing 1,000 forms&#8221;.</p></li><li><p>Suppose they have 100 bureaucrats, and each bureaucrat can process 10 forms per year.</p></li><li><p>Seems like they can approve 1 drug per year.</p></li><li><p>If you fire half the bureaucrats, now they can only approve one drug every 2 years.</p></li><li><p>That&#8217;s worse!</p></li></ol><p>A few years ago, <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/contra-drum-on-the-fish-oil-story\">I debated Kevin Drum</a> about (what I considered) a particularly egregious case where the FDA dragged its feet approving a life-saving medication. Drum argued that the FDA had behaved well. In support, he found some quotes from the doctor working on the medication, who praised all the FDA bureaucrats she had interacted with, calling them extremely helpful. This bothered me for a while, until I realized that <em>of course</em> it was true. In the model above, each bureaucrat processes ten forms. If the bureaucrats are benevolent, this might look like talking to the doctors, walking them through the process of figuring out their ten forms, and doing the work to add their ten forms to the FDA&#8217;s growing pile of evidence supporting the application.</p><p>All of this co-exists comfortably with the insight that making doctors fill out a thousand forms before they can use a medication is an impediment to medical progress.</p><p>This really sunk in for me when I read an article about the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban in 2021. Many Afghans had collaborated with the Americans, eg as translators, in exchange for a promise of US citizenship. As the Taliban advanced, they called in the promise, begging to be allowed to flee to America before they got punished as traitors. The article focused on a heroic effort by certain immigration bureaucrats, who worked around the clock with minimal sleep for the last few weeks before Kabul fell, trying to get the citizenship forms filled in and approved for as many translators as possible. It made an impression on me because nobody was opposed to the translators getting citizenship, and the bureaucrats were themselves the people in charge of approving citizenship applications, so what exactly was forcing them to go to such desperate lengths? If you ponder this question long enough, you become enlightened about the nature of the administrative state.</p><p>If you don&#8217;t, you end up like Ramaswamy, who seems to think that halving the number of bureaucrats will halve the number of forms that need to be filled out. I think in his worldview, the FDA will think &#8220;Now that we have fewer bureaucrats, it would take forever to complete our current process, so let&#8217;s simplify the process.&#8221; </p><p>Maybe he is working off a thesis where red tape expands to consume the resources available to it (as measured in bureaucrats). But my impression is that the amount of red tape is determined more by things like:</p><p><em>&#8212; How likely is it that their decision will get challenged in court?</em> </p><p>And if it gets challenged in court, what amount of paperwork do they have to show the judge to prove that they made the decision on a &#8220;reasonable basis&#8221;?</p><p>For example, when I type &#8220;FDA sued&#8221; into Google, the top result is <a href=\"https://www.food-safety.com/articles/10025-lawsuit-filed-against-fda-for-failure-to-remove-phthalates-from-food-contact-materials\">a news story from a few days ago</a>, saying that an environmental organization sued the FDA for not listening to their earlier request to ban phthalates from food. </p><p>Six years ago, the environmental groups submitted a petition (the catchily-named &#8220;Food Additive Petition 6B4815&#8221;) demanding that the FDA ban 28 phthalates. Two years ago, after consulting with industry, the FDA finally banned 23 phthalates but said that the other five were okay, releasing <a href=\"https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/fda_phthalates_decision_may_2022.pdf\">a 58 page decision</a> explaining its decision. Two days ago, the environmental groups sued, saying the remaining 5 phthalates are still bad.</p><p>I assume the lawsuit will nitpick the details of the the 58 page decision, trying to prove that it it didn&#8217;t violate any of hundreds of federal laws saying that bureaucratic decisions must be reasonable, bureaucratic decisions must be based on science, bureaucratic decisions must respond to the petitioners&#8217; complaints, bureaucratic decisions cannot have disparate impacts on different races, etc. I also assume that if the FDA <em>had</em> banned all the phthalates, they would have faced an equally serious lawsuit from Big Phthalate saying they were unfairly crippling business.</p><p>Why does it take six years to respond to a petition? My guess is because they knew they would get sued and so they have some sort of million-step process that addresses every single thing you can sue over, so that they can prove to the court that their process addresses all possible complaints and they followed it to the letter.</p><p>If you cut their bureaucrats in half, that doesn&#8217;t mean there will be fewer steps in the process. It means they&#8217;ll keep wanting not to get sued, the process will stay the same, and everything will take twice as long.</p><p><em>&#8212; What has Congress mandated that they do?</em></p><p> For example, when I Google &#8220;Congressional FDA mandate&#8221;, I get a page on HR 7248, a bill currently making its way through Congress, which says:</p><blockquote><p>This bill requires the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to establish a process that supports nonclinical testing methods for drug development that do not involve the use of animals.</p><p>Specifically, the FDA must establish a pathway by which entities may apply to have nonclinical testing methods approved for use in a particular context. Qualifying methods must be intended to replace or reduce animal testing and to either improve the safety and efficacy of nonclinical testing or reduce the time to develop a drug. The FDA must issue its decision within 180 days of receiving an application. The FDA must also prioritize the review of applications for drugs that are developed using an approved nonclinical testing method.</p><p>The FDA must annually post a report on its website that summarizes the results of the bill's implementation, including the number of applications received, types of methods that were approved, and the estimated number of animals saved as result of these methods.</p></blockquote><p>So the FDA has to establish this process and post an annual report on its website. How many bureaucrats per year does this take? Maybe five? If you halve the number of people at the FDA, you still need a constant five bureaucrats to comply with this particular law.</p><p>If the bill passes, the FDA comes up with a nonclinical testing process, and someone (eg the nonclinical testing industry) doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s good enough, they can sue the FDA for not following the law. How good a nonclinical testing process will the FDA need in order to avoid lawsuits under this bill? I assume there is a large body of administrative law answering that question, and that it will take many bureaucrats to figure this out.</p><p>Finally, I admit I&#8217;m a bit confused by this. IIRC &#8220;nonclinical testing&#8221; refers to things like testing drugs on stem cells or artificial organs instead of humans. You can obviously do this for some parts of the drug testing process, but not others; the FDA has already adjusted for this and integrated it into their guidelines to some extent. I can&#8217;t tell whether this law is a righteous attempt to correct bureaucratic foot-dragging, or a powergrab by Big Nonclinical Testing demanding that the FDA privilege their products over other forms of experiment. If the latter, the FDA may try to come up with some fake pathway that satisfies the letter of the law without really giving Big Nonclinical Testing any unfair privileges, and Big Nonclinical Testing will probably sue and say it violates this bill. How many bureaucrats do you think it will take to manage <em>that</em>?</p><p><em>&#8212; How much will they get yelled at if they take too long to approve drugs, vs. if they mistakenly approve a bad drug?</em></p><p>This is the basic determinant of all FDA drug approvals. </p><p>Halving the number of FDA bureaucrats wouldn&#8217;t have literally zero effect on this balance. It would mean that approving new drugs would be delayed twice as long. This would be a little more outrageous than the current delay, and might shift an outrage-minimizing FDA director slightly in the direction of cutting rules. But solve for the equilibrium: there would still be more delay than there is now. Also, I don&#8217;t think public outrage about long drug delays is linear with regard to delay, and public outrage at bad drugs is constant and large. So I think at best, firing bureaucrats would shift this balance a small amount, and only by making everything overall worse.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>One possible objection: this assumes that the average bureaucracy is like the FDA drug approval process. But the FDA drug approval process&#8217; job is to approve things. Maybe the average bureaucracy&#8217;s job is to ban things. Then decreasing their capacity would be good.</p><p>(Vivek gets to be main example here because he tweeted, but the same considerations apply to Elon: even though the government as a whole is delaying SpaceX rocket launches, individual bureaucrats might be speeding them up through the same 1000-forms logic as in the FDA case)</p><p>There&#8217;s certainly a spectrum from the most approval-focused bureaucracies to the most ban-focused bureaucracies. Thinking hard about this spectrum would be a step up from &#8220;instantly&#8221; firing 50% of all bureaucrats based on social security number. So maybe a steelman of Vivek&#8217;s point would be to fire 50% of people in the ban-focused bureaucracies (and maybe double the number of people in the approval-focused ones?)</p><p>I&#8217;m still skeptical that this is how it works. The past few years <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-05-28/regulate-crypto-even-libertarians-should-support-this-bill\">have seen the cryptocurrency industry demand regulation</a>, and the government mostly fail to step up (though crypto businesses <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2024/11/11/crypto-industry-trump-cryptocurrency-regulations-rules/\">hope</a> the Trump administration will do better). Why do crypto businesses want to be regulated more? Because the alternative is something where it&#8217;s not clear what&#8217;s legal and anyone could be sued or shut down at any time. The chief legal officer of Coinbase, from the second link:</p><blockquote><p>All of us are begging for sensible standards that would allow us to get back to building great products and services and spend less time and frankly, less money, arguing over legal definitions and statutes.</p></blockquote><p>This isn&#8217;t because anyone specifically banned crypto. It&#8217;s because there are bans on other things (like unlicensed securities, money laundering, etc) that crypto is vaguely related to, sometimes an agency regulating these things will tell a crypto company &#8220;sorry, we think you&#8217;re illegal&#8221;, and crypto wants some specific list of things it can follow that explicitly establish it as on the right side of money-laundering and security-licensing laws. Obviously industries would prefer that these be simple and easy standards (&#8220;oh, don&#8217;t worry, you don&#8217;t have to worry about money laundering if you&#8217;re a crypto company&#8221;), but they would settle for strict regulations as long as the regulations carve out some ability for them exist at all.</p><p>I&#8217;ve seen the same thing play out in another area I follow, cultured meat. There are many laws about what meat you can and cannot sell, how the animals have to be treated, what the sanitation standards are, et cetera. Some of these standards make no sense when applied to cultured meat; others, cultured meat naturally fails by default (you can&#8217;t prove you&#8217;re treating the animals in a certain way because there are no animals). Others are novel philosophical questions (can you sell cultured meat without saying it&#8217;s cultured? How big does the print need to be before it counts as saying that it&#8217;s cultured? What about on restaurant menus?) </p><p>Situations like these mean that there&#8217;s no clear distinction between default-yes and default-no bureaucracies. There&#8217;s no explicit ban on crypto or cultured meat. But if you cripple bureaucracies&#8217; ability to interact with these fields, it doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re fully legal, free, and happy forever. It means they&#8217;re stuck in regulatory limbo.</p><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>So it seems like you don&#8217;t want to fire bureaucrats, you want to cut red tape. In our toy model, you want to reduce the number of forms from 1,000 to (let&#8217;s say) 100. Then the same number of bureaucrats can get drugs approved ten times faster.</p><p>In our non-toy actual model of what&#8217;s going on, this would require changing incentives. </p><p>Maybe you could change judicial procedures so that fewer people sue, or the FDA needs less evidence to win any given lawsuit. This sounds hard (Vivek and Elon seem more qualified to wield chainsaws than to understand legal minutiae), possibly illegal (does the administrative branch even control how judicial procedure works?), and politically unpopular (this basically looks like telling people &#8220;f@#k you, companies can put as many phthalates as they want in food, we don&#8217;t have to prove that this decision is evidence based, and you&#8217;re not allowed to challenge us.&#8221;)</p><p>Or it would require Congress to repeal legislation mandating things. These Congressional mandates are probably things that Congressmen and their constituents (either real constituents or special interests) care a lot about, so good luck getting them repealed. Also, doesn&#8217;t Congress pass like one bill per year now?</p><p>This would normally make me pessimistic, but Vivek and other anti-bureaucracy activists have pointed to a recent success story: Idaho.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb73cf3f3-e501-49b6-b2a3-b84c602d5038_481x344.webp\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"374.03742203742206\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb73cf3f3-e501-49b6-b2a3-b84c602d5038_481x344.webp\" width=\"523\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Idaho cut their regulatory code by 38% in 2019, and since then it&#8217;s only gone down. How did they decrease red tape so fast? They did it through the power of nominative determinism. In that year, they elected a governor named Brad Little. His administration is called the Little Administration. Obviously government had to get smaller. </p><p>But on a purely exoteric level, what methods did they use to pull this off?</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cpac.org/post/zero-based-regulation-and-the-future-of-american-governance-lessons-from-idaho\">This CPAC article</a> gives the basic story:</p><ul><li><p>The Little administration instituted sunset provisions that review each regulation every five years and make sure it&#8217;s justifiable.</p></li><li><p>The Idaho regulatory code is short enough that individual agencies&#8217; portions are only a few hundred pages, and humans from those agencies can read the few hundred pages and see if they make sense.</p></li><li><p>Upon being read, many of the regulations were not justifiable, for example &#8220;rules for a lottery game show that never aired&#8221;.</p></li><li><p>The Idaho legislature is competent and reviews all regulations proposed by the state&#8217;s regulatory agencies (though it looks like they only strike down 5%). </p></li><li><p>Regulatory agencies have to justify every new regulation they make, and (unless they can present a compelling case why not) repeal two old regulations per one new one.</p></li></ul><p>I don&#8217;t have a good sense for how well this could work at the federal level. The pessimistic case is that the governor wanted a legacy of repealing regulations, there are many completely useless regulations in the code (like the one for the lottery show that never aired), bureaucrats removed these from the code to satisfy the governor, but these don&#8217;t have a big effect in real life (the show never aired, so it&#8217;s not like anyone was affected by the regulations!) This kind of thing would lower the number of pages in the regulatory code (which isn&#8217;t nothing!) but not make ordinary people&#8217;s lives easier.</p><p>But the article suggests that ordinary people&#8217;s lives were made easier, and that the move has brought businesses to Idaho. It gives the example of repealing a regulation about what kind of doors pharmacies can have. Here I guess the theory of change is that there are many stupid regulations that nobody wants to defend, and if you force people to read them and put a trivial amount of effort into justifying them, they&#8217;ll fold immediately.</p><p>Are the most burdensome federal regulations more like the pharmacy door, where nobody can remember why they exist? Or are they more like phthalates, where environmental groups and industry groups fought each other to a bloody standstill, and any attempt to change anything will be met with lawsuits? </p><p>More important, can DOGE get nominative determinism on their side? &#8220;Ramaswamy&#8221; means &#8220;Lord Rama&#8221;, who - although cool - is not really associated with smallness. But it seems like the word &#8220;Musk&#8221; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musk\">may ultimately derive</a> from the Indo-European word m&#250;h&#8322;s, meaning &#8220;mouse&#8221;.

After returning to DC, he mentioned to some White House staffers that a large rabbit had swum towards him \u201chissing menacingly\u201d and he\u2019d had to scare it away. Four months later, press secretary Jody Powell\u2014possibly after a lot of drinking\u2014mentioned this story to Associated Press reporter Brooks Jackson, which resulted in this front-page article in the Washington Post:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Washington post\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/links/washington_post.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>The country went crazy and spent more than a week mocking Carter for this ridiculous story\u2014a story that Carter only mentioned <em>in private</em>, to his staffers, and which was apparently leaked to the press <em>by Carter\u2019s own press secretary.</em> But Carter refused to comment.</p>\n\n<p>After Reagan beat Carter in the 1980 election, his administration found a photo taken by a White House photographer and\u2014the rabbit was real:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Carter rabbit\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/links/rabbit.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>See also: <a href=\"https://www.candyforbreakfast.email/\">Max Nussenbaum</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/your-book-review-the-outlier\">excellent review</a> of Kai Bird\u2019s biography of Carter, <em>The Outlier</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Note:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the fate of the rabbit is unknown.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(2) <a href=\"https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Likelihood_principle#The_voltmeter_story\">The voltmeter story</a></p>\n\n<p>Does it matter how information gets to you? For example, say a paper comes out that tries yelling at kids in school and finds that yelling is not effective at making them learn faster. You might worry: If the experiment had found that yelling <em>was</em> effective, would it have been published? Would anyone dare to talk about it?</p>\n\n<p>How much should you downweight evidence like this, where the outcome changes the odds you\u2019d see it?</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a true believer fundamentalist Bayesian, the answer is: None. You ignore all those concerns and give the evidence full weight. At a high level, that\u2019s because Bayesianism is all about probabilities in <em>this</em> world, so what <em>could</em> have happened in some <em>other world</em> doesn\u2019t matter.</p>\n\n<p>The voltmeter story is an evocative tale where this conclusion seems intuitive and hard to avoid. But is it really always valid? I constantly see people who are enthusiastic about Bayesian reasoning argue in ways that are inconsistent with this rule. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s because they aren\u2019t aware of the rule, or it\u2019s because it\u2019s a bullet they aren\u2019t willing to bite (or both).</p>\n\n<p>(3) <a href=\"https://xanadu.com/\">PROJECT XANADU\u00ae</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Founded 1960 * The Original Hypertext Project</p>\n\n  <p>\u201cXanadu\u00ae\u201d and the Eternal-Flaming-X logo are registered trademarks of Project Xanadu.</p>\n\n  <p><strong>The computer world is not just technicality and razzle-dazzle.\u00a0 It is a continual war over software politics and paradigms.\u00a0 With ideas which are still radical, WE FIGHT ON.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think this is some kind of way of\u2026 visualizing text?

Doug points out <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/05/13/why-were-turning-psychiatric-labels-into-identities\">this article</a> which mentions the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology. The idea seems to be that, instead of saying someone \u201cis a psychopath\u201d or \u201cis not a psychopath\u201d, you\u2019d measure to what <em>degree</em> they have dozens of interrelated <em>features</em> of psychopathy:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HiTOP_Model.png\"><img alt=\"Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/links/HiTOP.png\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I have no real opinion about this but I suspect it gets at some deep issues about the meaning of science and human nature, so I\u2019m hoping someone (<a href=\"https://www.experimental-history.com/\">Experimental History</a>? <a href=\"https://slimemoldtimemold.com/\">SMTM</a>?) will explain.</p>\n\n<p>(5) <a href=\"https://justismills.substack.com/p/slightly-more-than-you-wanted-to\">Slightly More Than You Wanted To Know: Pregnancy Length Effects</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Everyone agrees that pre-32 weeks is really bad, pre-37 weeks is pretty bad, and post-42 weeks is dangerous.

This is a concept album, with \u201cphonetic pseudo-Japanese\u201d lyrics apparently written using a Japanese dictionary, and recorded with a children\u2019s choir and a black-belt Judo master. It\u2019s an frantic mixture of innocence and mayhem that doesn\u2019t really fit into any existing musical genre, but I always felt that it shared some of the spirit of modern electronic music.

Viruses infect cells by having proteins on their coat bind to specific molecules on the cell membrane. Vir<em>oids</em> are pieces of RNA that are similar to viruses but with no protein coating. All known viroids only infect plant cells. They are can survive without a protein coat because they have an extremely stable (circular) structure and often just rely on damage (e.g. from insects) to get into cells.</p>\n\n<p>Well, good news!

I apologise to everyone who had timeout issues over the first week of January. This has been resolved and I have auto-scalers in place to prevent timeouts from happening in the future.</p>\n<p>Before I get into the questions, I'd like to give a shout-out to both <a href=\"https://kevquirk.com\">Kev Quirk</a> and <a href=\"https://manuelmoreale.com\">Manu</a>. I follow both of their RSS feeds and was pleasantly surprised to see the Bear Blog question challenge on their blogs, despite being off-platform. It's been so interesting and lovely reading about everyone's blogging journeys.</p>\n<p>Let's do this!</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-why-did-you-make-a-blog-in-the-first-place\">1. Why did you make a blog in the first place?</h2><p>I've been blogging in some form or another since about 2014 (10 years!). Most of my early posts were your standard coming-of-age pieces. As most young people do, I felt like I was seeing reality and my place in the universe for the first time and needed an outlet for these <em>deep thoughts</em>. Those posts are lost to time, which I'm both glad\u2014but also a little sad\u2014about.</p>\n<p>Later blogging became a way to share my experiences building delightful tools for the internet, as well as random tangents about air-powered vehicles, traffic circles, and other oddities. I found that by exploring a topic in-depth and then writing about it, it solidified my understanding of the topic. It allowed me to critique my own opinions and reason about the subject more holistically. In many ways, blogging helped me learn about the world around me, and retain that information (hopefully long-term).</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-why-did-you-choose-bear-blog\">2. Why did you choose Bear Blog?</h2><p>This is a funny question for me, since I'm the creator of the platform. But in a way it's a good question because I <strong>chose</strong> Bear Blog the most. I'd tried all of the other platforms, from self-hosting pure HTML, to Jekyll, to Hugo. I'd signed up for Ghost and Wordpress, and many more that each had <em>something</em> good, but were never quite <em>right</em>. Bear is my attempt to take all of the great platform choices, distill them down, and discard the unnecessary. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmSBIyT0ih0\">Design by subtraction</a>, if you will.</p>\n<p>I was just very lucky that so many people resonated with my opinions. Bear wouldn't be what it is without you all.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-have-you-blogged-on-other-platforms-before\">3. Have you blogged on other platforms before?</h2><p>I guess I answered this in the previous question. But yes. I've been around the block.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-do-you-write-your-posts-directly-in-the-editor-or-in-another-software\">4. Do you write your posts directly in the editor or in another software?</h2><p>I generally write my first draft in Apple Notes then transcribe it to the Bear Blog editor when it's in roughly the correct shape. I'm generally not a fan of proprietary editors that try to do too much, and Apple Notes works as expected, is free (assuming you've bought into the ecosystem), and syncs between my devices.</p>\n<p>I used to use iA writer, but just naturally found myself using Apple Notes, since it's also where I take all kinds of other notes and keep my work log.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-when-do-you-feel-most-inspired-to-write\">5. When do you feel most inspired to write?</h2><p>I rarely feel very inspired to write. Instead I feel inspired by ideas and thoughts. Most of the time writing is difficult and requires some inertia to get going, especially if I've lost <em>writing momentum</em>.</p>\n<p>If I'm to be incredibly reductive, there are two kinds of writers: One kind can't help but write. Words flow from them into the world. The other kind pull words into the world, kicking and screaming. Like getting out of bed too early after a late night.</p>\n<p>I'm sometimes one, and sometimes the other. Sometimes it's easy, and sometimes it's hard. What I aspire to, though, is to become the kind of writer who shows up regardless. The kind of writer that doesn't rely on the fleetingness of motivation. I find taking a long walk helps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6-do-you-publish-immediately-after-writing-or-do-you-let-it-simmer-a-bit-as-a-draft\">6. Do you publish immediately after writing or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?</h2><p>I generally outline a post in my head or in my notes and let the idea gestate. While I'm driving or taking a walk, or in the shower, the post kinda fleshes itself out, and I keep adding to the notes. Then (when inspiration strikes, but see question 5) I sit down and write a rough first draft. I don't edit or even look at the first draft again until the next day, where I re-read and edit it with fresh eyes before publishing.</p>\n<p>In this way my writing process is broken down into 3 phases, usually on 3 different days:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ideation</li>\n<li>Writing</li>\n<li>Editing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This isn't prescriptive, by any means. It's just what works for me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-your-favourite-post-on-your-blog\">7. Your favourite post on your blog?</h2><p>There are some posts I'm certainly more proud of than others. The one that I feel has captured <em>me</em> very well is <a href=\"https://herman.bearblog.dev/my-product-is-my-garden/\">My product is my garden</a>. However, if I can break with the rules and add another post that is more of a short story, it would be <a href=\"https://herman.bearblog.dev/the-gods-of-toil/\">The Gods of Toil</a>.</p>\n<p>I find that there's generally a negative correlation between posts that I'm very proud of, and the number of reads and upvotes it gets. My most recent post was a rant about me having to upgrade my iPhone. It has become one of my most-read posts, and I understand that it resonated with a lot of people. But I'm significantly more proud of my post on building a better ranking algorithm for Bear. I guess there's a larger subset of people who are unhappy with the state of smartphones than people who are interested in ranking algorithms. So be it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8-any-future-plans-for-your-blog\">8. Any future plans for your blog?</h2><p>The style and structure of my blog will likely remain as it is for the foreseeable future. I love the simplicity and legibility of it, but it also acts as the \"Example blog\" of Bear, so I feel it needs to show the underlying structure of the platform without any embellishments. I have, however, enjoyed seeing the creativity on so many people's blogs and have felt the pull to do similarly. Bear has explicitly been built so that it's simple to use, but also has incredible depth if you don't mind getting your hands dirty.</p>\n<p>That being said, the content on my blog is likely to shift this year. Since the platform itself is stable and mostly feature-complete, I'm going to be spending a lot more time doing interesting things and writing about them. I have a backlog of posts I've been meaning to get to, and there's no time like the present.</p>\n<h2 id=\"to-end-off\">To end off</h2><p>I don't think I've been as excited about a year as I am for 2025. I feel a crackling of magic in the air.</p>\n<p>To all of you, happy new year! May it be filled with interesting work, adventures, good food, and good people.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"IMG_0236\" src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman/img_0236.webp\" /></p>"
