Initially I felt that the enormous corpus of pre-existing code would cement existing languages in place but now I&#8217;m starting to think the opposite is true. Here I want to outline my thinking on why we are going to see more new programming languages and why there is quite a bit of space for interesting innovation. And just in case someone wants to start building one, here are some of my thoughts on what we should aim for!</p> <h2>Why New Languages Work</h2> <p>Does an agent perform dramatically better on a language that it has in its weights? Obviously yes. But there are less obvious factors that affect how good an agent is at programming in a language: how good the tooling around it is and how much churn there is.</p> <p>Zig seems underrepresented in the weights (at least in the models I&#8217;ve used) and also changing quickly. That combination is not optimal, but it&#8217;s still passable: you can program even in the upcoming Zig version if you point the agent at the right documentation. But it&#8217;s",

One could wait for two missed menstrual cycles, watch for the first signs of a baby bump, or listen closely for a fetal heartbeat, but none of these methods work until several months into gestation. Ancient and medieval sources describe a variety of possible tests to determine whether a person was pregnant, but none were remotely reliable by modern standards.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.asimov.press/feed#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a></p><p>In the 19th and 20th centuries, researchers began looking for a solution in the emerging science of endocrinology, the systematic study of hormones. It was during this era that doctors and biologists began to shift from studying anatomy (observing the mechanics of visible organs) to exploring the invisible potency of &#8220;internal secretions&#8221; and &#8220;juices&#8221; that directed bodily phenomena. Early experiments by endocrinologists were crude, however, usually involving the injection of fluids from one animal (or human) into another and seeing what happened.</p><p>One pioneering endocrinologist who predicted the existence of hormone chemicals was Charles-&#201;douard Brown-S&#233;quard. In 1889, he <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673600641181\">shared results</a> from a &#8220;study&#8221; in which he injected himself with an elixir of &#8220;the three following parts: first, blood of the testicular veins; secondly, semen; and thirdly, juice extracted from a testicle, crushed immediately after it has been taken from dog or a guinea-pig.&#8221; Brown-S&#233;quard found that these testes-semen injections restored to him all the vigor of his youth, though few others have been able to reproduce his results.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.asimov.press/feed#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a></p><p>In this spirit, two doctors working in Berlin, Selmar Aschheim and Bernhard Zondek,<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.asimov.press/feed#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a> discovered an early pregnancy test in 1928 by injecting patients&#8217; urine into laboratory mice. A few days after the injections, the mouse would be killed and dissected so that its ovaries could be examined; if the patient who provided the urine sample was pregnant, the mouse would develop &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001763\">ovarian blood spots</a>.&#8221; </p><p>In the U.S., Maurice Friedman <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4468/12/3/56\">adapted this approach for rabbits</a> because a single rabbit could handle a larger volume of urine, their ovulation patterns are a bit more reliable, and clinical centers generally found them easier to house. His &#8220;rabbit test,&#8221; released in 1931, became the American standard for several years. Yet both the mouse and rabbit tests had significant drawbacks: they required waiting several days for results, and the animals had to be euthanized or at least operated upon to check for signs of ovulation.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ys8_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb003c7e-f1c5-4ff7-b923-5c7462a9ac0e_489x773.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"773\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ys8_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb003c7e-f1c5-4ff7-b923-5c7462a9ac0e_489x773.jpeg\" width=\"489\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">The Aschheim-Zondek reaction, as published in &#8220;A text-book of midwifery for students and practitioners&#8221; in 1934.

Unlike the rabbit test, this new &#8220;bioassay&#8221; was faster and left the animal perfectly unharmed for future use. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/05/how-a-frog-became-the-first-mainstream-pregnancy-test/525285/\">Word spread quickly</a>, and within a few years, biological institutions everywhere were inundated with ovulating Xenopus frogs.</p><p>Thanks to the discovery of the specific <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/28/us/georgeanna-s-jones-in-vitro-conception-pioneer-dies-at-92.html\">&#8220;pregnancy hormone&#8221;</a> (chorionic gonadotropin, or hCG) and lateral flow devices that can detect its presence, modern-day pregnancy tests do not require rabbits, frogs, or indeed, any other animal. But their <a href=\"https://ijdb.ehu.eus/article/pdf/10761846\">widespread use</a> for pregnancy testing was what likely helped entrench <em><a href=\"https://ijdb.ehu.eus/article/pdf/10761846\">Xenopus laevis</a></em> (and a few of its cousins) in scientific research.</p><p>Xenopus frogs possess a strangely zen-like charisma. Their lidless eyes protrude from the tops of their flat heads, and when not feeding, swimming, or mating, they tend to laze in the water and stare at you. They lack tongues; instead, they open their maws and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80TBSUwc-pg\">shovel in prey</a> with their front feet as it passes. These same feet allow them to grip females during mating, while they use their webbed back feet, equipped with distinctive black claws on the last three toes, to swim. These appendages inspired their name, &#8220;<em>Xenopus,</em>&#8221; which means strange-footed.</p><p>The sudden abundance of Xenopus in laboratories during the 1930s and 40s may seem like a stroke of luck for biologists, but in truth, frogs were not newcomers to research labs. Well before Xenopus frogs were used as &#8220;obstetrical consultants&#8221; (<a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5277610/?page=11\">as one scientist referred</a> to such animals), many other frog species played a role in developmental biology.</p><p>The main reason for this was convenience: frogs are relatively easy to find, catch, and house, as anyone who grew up near a pond can attest. They also lay many eggs at a time, and their eggs are generally larger than most fish eggs but unencased by hard shells like bird eggs, making them excellent research subjects for understanding embryonic development.</p><p>The most prominent early frog experiments were performed way back in the 18th century by Italian scientist, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazzaro_Spallanzani\">Lazzaro Spallanzani</a> (whose other accolades include the discovery that bats use echolocation and that digestion harnesses the chemistry of gastric juices). By brushing unfertilized eggs with frog sperm, Spallanzani proved that fertilization could occur outside the female body &#8212; a finding he later confirmed in mammals through the successful <em>in vitro</em> fertilization of a dog.</p><p>Perhaps his most memorable experiment, however, was his demonstration that it was specifically semen that caused fertilization. He proved this using a negative control: Spallanzani sent off male frogs to &#8220;seek the females with equal eagerness, and perform, as well as they can, the act of generation&#8221; while wearing miniature taffeta breeches that he had meticulously sewn for their tiny legs, preventing their semen from reaching any eggs. The result of this experiment, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/dissertationsrel02spal/page/14/mode/2up\">he wrote</a>, &#8220;is such as may be expected: the eggs are never prolific [e.g., fertilized], for want of having been bedewed with semen, which sometimes may be seen in the breeches in the form of drops.&#8221;<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.asimov.press/feed#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!T7ib!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe713ef34-e197-4d94-a18f-b8eef894fd47_2264x1504.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"967\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!T7ib!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe713ef34-e197-4d94-a18f-b8eef894fd47_2264x1504.jpeg\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">A statue of Lazzaro Spallanzani examining a frog.

However, these studies were usually done using locally available species, such as frogs from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rana_(genus)\">genus </a><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rana_(genus)\">Rana</a></em> (which includes most common pond frogs of Europe, Asia, and North America). It was a century and a half after Spallanzani sewed his silk condom-pants that American and European biologists found themselves with an abundance of <em>Xenopus</em> eggs on their hands thanks to their use in fertility testing.</p><p>The same qualities that made African clawed frogs attractive for pregnancy testing also made them excellent laboratory models; they do fairly well in captivity. <em>Xenopus</em> are fully aquatic species<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.asimov.press/feed#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" target=\"_self\">6</a> with simple needs, at least by most amphibian standards. They eat almost anything, can survive in tap water,<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.asimov.press/feed#footnote-7\" id=\"footnote-anchor-7\" target=\"_self\">7</a> and can live for up to twenty years. And a single brood from these frogs yields hundreds to thousands of eggs at a time.</p><div class=\"youtube-wrap\" id=\"youtube2-80TBSUwc-pg\"><div class=\"youtube-inner\"></div></div><p>For scientists, these eggs are far more interesting than the adult frogs. Just one-tenth the size of a typical marble, but clearly visible to the naked eye, these two-toned eggs are dark on one side and light on the other, a pattern reminiscent of a Pok&#233; Ball. The contrast between these two colored sections (with a grey crescent in between) becomes more pronounced after fertilization, when the pigmentation concentrates at the site of sperm entry. This darker half of the egg is known as the &#8220;animal&#8221; pole, the half which will divide into smaller cells more quickly, and is thus more &#8220;animated&#8221; relative to its &#8220;vegetal&#8221; pole, the lighter-colored half characterized by dense yolk. </p><p>Today, one can find <a href=\"https://www.xenbase.org/xenbase/static/anatomy/movies.jsp\">numerous videos</a> showing how no special dyes or equipment (beyond, perhaps, a magnifying lens) are necessary to observe the early rounds of cellular division in <em>Xenopus </em>eggs; meticulous work by dozens of scientists has since determined <a href=\"https://www.xenbase.org/xenbase/static/anatomy/xenbasefate.jsp\">which organs will arise</a> for these early cell divisions.</p><p>Beyond their visual properties, frog eggs are also useful research subjects because their embryos are easily manipulated; eggs can be poked, prodded, and even completely torn apart while still maintaining the capability to develop into tadpoles.

The &#8220;miners&#8221; of the time, however, lacked the metaphorical tools needed to dig up the secrets of these organizer cells. Although they knew, generally, that all biological traits were controlled by chromosomes housed in the cell&#8217;s nucleus, they did not know how those chromosomes gave rise to genes.</p><p>That changed in 1953, when Watson and Crick published their celebrated papers describing the structure of the DNA molecule and how it suggested a mechanism of gene inheritance. The work over the next decade that would unveil the secrets of the genetic code was mostly done in simple models such as bacteria, viruses, or yeast cells. But it was, incidentally, a <em>Xenopus </em>experiment that provided the most dramatic demonstration that even adult animal cells retained the entire genetic library of information necessary to recreate an organism.</p><p>In 1968, following experiments by Robert Briggs and Thomas King showing that the nucleus of one cell can be successfully transferred into another, developmental biologist <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4286343/\">John Gurdon</a> took the nucleus from an adult frog cell and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5693830/\">injected it into an egg</a> whose nucleus had been removed. The resulting egg, now carrying DNA from an adult &#8220;parent,&#8221; was capable of growing into a normal tadpole and then adult frog, with all the varied cell types of a normal animal. This new frog was a &#8220;clone,&#8221; from the Greek word for &#8220;twig,&#8221; being grown, as it were, from a clipping of an adult tree instead of from a seed.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.asimov.press/feed#footnote-9\" id=\"footnote-anchor-9\" target=\"_self\">9</a> Dolly, a sheep cloned in 1996, gained notoriety as the first cloned mammal, but the <a href=\"https://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/content/2021/12/pdb.top107615.long\">first </a><em><a href=\"https://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/content/2021/12/pdb.top107615.long\">animal</a></em><a href=\"https://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/content/2021/12/pdb.top107615.long\"> cloned</a> from an adult cell was actually a <em>Xenopus</em> frog, nearly three decades earlier.</p><p>Today, if you overhear a molecular biologist talk about their &#8220;cloning work,&#8221; they are unlikely to be discussing attempts to make an identical twin out of a grown animal. Instead, they are probably speaking about the cloning of specific genes; synthesizing or copying the sequence of a gene (the specific combination of DNA chemical letters that spell it out) and amplifying it by taking advantage of the rapid proliferation (and gene copying capacity) of the bacterium <em>E. coli</em>. However, this still routes us back to the frog, as this basic technique of having bacteria express a gene from a eukaryote was first achieved with the successful <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4600264/\">cloning of a </a><em><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4600264/\">Xenopus</a></em><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4600264/\"> gene</a> in 1974.</p><p>Genetic cloning was made possible by three discoveries: restriction enzymes, molecular scissors that cut DNA at specific sequences, ligases that could rejoin those fragments into new arrangements, and the idea of including antibiotic resistance genes alongside the cloned gene so that successful constructs can be identified using antibiotics. Herb Boyer at UC San Francisco, who had purified the restriction enzyme EcoRI (and would go on to found <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genentech\">Genentech</a>, widely regarded as the world&#8217;s <a href=\"https://press.asimov.com/articles/gmo-patent\">first biotechnology company</a>, in 1976), conceived the idea alongside Stanford bacterial geneticist Stanley Cohen while the two were discussing their research over sandwiches at a Hawaiian deli in 1972.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.asimov.press/feed#footnote-10\" id=\"footnote-anchor-10\" target=\"_self\">10</a> After transforming bacteria with their stitched-together plasmids, <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000653\">Boyer recounted</a> checking the results: &#8220;I went to look at the gels in the darkroom, and there it was. It actually brought tears to my eyes, it was so exciting.&#8221;</p><p>Boyer and Cohen, along with other scientists, soon went further than introducing bacteria-derived genes back into other bacteria. In <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4600264/\">1974</a>, their team spliced the <em>Xenopus </em>ribosomal RNA gene into <em>E. coli</em> cells. This frog gene was selected because it had been thoroughly &#8220;characterized and can be isolated in [a large] quantity.&#8221; This extraordinary result demonstrated that bacteria could be coaxed into reading and copying genes from across a billion-year evolutionary divide, laying the foundation for the fields of genetic engineering, synthetic biology, and <a href=\"https://press.asimov.com/articles/beyond-steel-tanks\">biomanufacturing</a>.</p><p>For all its upsides, however, <em>Xenopus laevis</em> had its shortcomings. The frog, so favored for its use in fertility testing and embryology, turned out to be poorly suited to genetic research because, instead of having two copies of each of its genes (one from each parent), it has <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19840\">approximately four </a>of each. This chromosomal messiness is not uncommon in nature, but having four similar &#8212; but not identical! &#8212; copies of their chromosomes makes sequencing <em>laevis</em> genomes significantly more difficult. A complete <em>laevis</em> genome assembly wasn&#8217;t released <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.03.030\">until 2016</a>, trailing a decade or more behind other model organisms such as <em><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01262\">Mus musculus </a></em><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01262\">(mouse)</a> and <em><a href=\"https://rgd.mcw.edu/rgdweb/report/reference/main.html?id=1303377\">Rattus norvegicus</a></em><a href=\"https://rgd.mcw.edu/rgdweb/report/reference/main.html?id=1303377\"> (lab rat)</a> or agricultural workhorses like <em><a href=\"https://bovinegenome.elsiklab.missouri.edu/history\">Bos taurus</a></em><a href=\"https://bovinegenome.elsiklab.missouri.edu/history\"> (cow)</a> and <em><a href=\"https://genome.cshlp.org/content/15/12/1692.full.pdf\">Gallus gallus </a></em><a href=\"https://genome.cshlp.org/content/15/12/1692.full.pdf\">(chicken)</a>.</p><p>Even without a solid understanding of <em>Xenopus</em> genetics, however, biologists in the 1980s found another remarkable way to put <em>Xenopus</em> eggs to good use. Eggs are essentially large cells; thus, a scientist with a large supply of eggs is also in possession of many easily manipulated cells. Just as young frog embryos remain intact after being prodded by needles, the cellular components of frog eggs remain biologically active even after those cells have been gently crushed and separated away from their yolks, chromosomes, and heavier components, thanks to the marvels of <a href=\"https://press.asimov.com/articles/centrifuge\">centrifugation</a>. This <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/339275a0\">cellular extract</a> could be generated in large quantities, and the resulting soup of proteins and organelles would still carry out many of the most intricate operations of a cell, but in a more easily observable and controllable system.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FGEX!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71a38043-c11f-4fa5-87e9-56582399486c_3000x2000.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"971\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FGEX!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71a38043-c11f-4fa5-87e9-56582399486c_3000x2000.jpeg\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><em>Xenopus l</em>aevis<em>. </em>Credit: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_clawed_frog#/media/File:Xenopus_laevis_02.jpg\">Brian Gratwicke</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Because these systems are not cells, but contain almost everything inside cells, they have been especially useful for understanding the amazingly well-coordinated mechanisms of cell division. <em>Xenopus</em> egg extracts were essential in the discovery of proteins that control the cell cycle, the dance of chromosomes as they arrange themselves for cell division, the <a href=\"https://www.ibiology.org/cell-biology/microtubules/#part-2\">self-assembly</a> of structural proteins called microtubules as they direct and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8636233/\">move those chromosomes</a>, and the role of small messenger proteins, <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(01)00218-5#:~:text=The%20original%20experiments%20demonstrating%20a%20role%20for%20Ran%20in%20spindle%20assembly%20were%20conducted%20in%20Xenopus%20egg%20extracts.\">called Rans</a>, in many aspects of cellular activity. What made all these discoveries possible is not only the fact that the components of these cell-free extracts are easily visualized, but also that they are exposed; there is no membranous barrier between the cellular components or any chemical that a scientist may wish to introduce into the system (or remove, such as by fishing out proteins using antibodies).</p><p>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, scientists <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/fulltext/S0168-9525(98)01506-6\">looking to conduct genetic research</a> on <em>Xenopus</em> frogs without the genetic challenges of <em>X. laevis</em> did some chromosomal explorations of related species, and by the late 1990s, <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/fulltext/S0168-9525(11)00136-3\">hit upon</a> <em>Xenopus tropicalis,</em> a species that possesses many of the <a href=\"https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/dvdy.10178\">advantages</a> of X. laevis but has only two sets of each chromosome instead of four. Some labs switched to using these frogs, but many groups that had well-established protocols for <em>X. laevis </em>were reluctant to do so, especially since <em>Xenopus tropicalis</em> requires <a href=\"https://www.xenbase.org/xenbase/static/community/xenopuswhitepaper/2020/2020_whitepaper_Final.pdf\">different housing and handling</a> conditions.<em> Xenopus tropicalis </em>frogs are also <a href=\"https://www.xenbase.org/xenbase/anatomy/intro.do\">smaller than </a><em><a href=\"https://www.xenbase.org/xenbase/anatomy/intro.do\">X. laevis</a></em>, with smaller eggs and brood sizes. Thankfully, genetic engineering has advanced a great deal over the past two decades, and today both <em>X. laevis </em>and <em>X. tropicalis </em><a href=\"https://www.xenbase.org/xenbase/\">are commonly used</a> in biology research.</p><p>Even if much more is known now than in the 1930s, when <em>Xenopus</em> frogs were first hopping around research labs, they are still being used to solve pressing questions of basic biology, as vertebrate animal models for drug development and testing, and in experiments whose findings may only be fully understood in years to come. Thanks to their historic role in the science of fertility and embryology, four African clawed frogs were even <a href=\"https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5DNQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2VUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6865%2C5891665\">lucky enough to be astronauts</a> in 1992, when they boarded the Space Shuttle Endeavour to test whether or not reproduction and development could occur in zero gravity.

This makes for a pernicious problem, one that sneaks up on us the longer we run agents.</p>\n\n<p>Of all the <a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html\">context fails</a>, context rot is the worst.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"enter-recursive-language-models\">Enter Recursive Language Models</h3>\n\n<p>Defined by Alex Zhang and Omar Khattab, <a href=\"https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2025/rlm/\">Recursive Language Models</a> (or RLMs) are a simple idea:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Load long context into a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop\">REPL</a> environment<sup id=\"fnref:repl\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2026/02/09/the-potential-of-rlms.html#fn:repl\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>, stored as variables.</li>\n  <li>Allow an LLM to use the REPL environment to explore and analyze the context.</li>\n  <li>Provide a function in the REPL to trigger a sub-LLM call.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That\u2019s it. That\u2019s an RLM. The LLM will use the REPL to filter, chunk, and sample the long context as needed to complete its task. It will use the sub-LLM function to task new LLM instances to explore, analyze, or validate the context. Eventually, the sum of the LLM\u2019s findings will be synthesized into a final answer.</p>\n\n<p>With this setup, the long context(s) can be <em>really</em> long. I\u2019ve given RLMs logfiles more than 400 megabytes in size, with no issues. In the original <a href=\"https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2025/rlm/\">RLM post</a>, Alex reports that performance doesn\u2019t degrade when &gt;10 million tokens are provided.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Alex Zhang's RLM paper shows RLM significantly mitigates the context rot decline.\" src=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/img/rlm_plot.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Note the orange lines on the right: as the context length increases, performance very slowly degrades, hovering around 50-60%. Compare this to the non-RLM results (with the same GPT-5 model), which dramatically decline until failing entirely at 262,000 tokens.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"rlms-work-by-turning-long-context-problems-into-coding--reasoning-problem\">RLMs Work By Turning Long Context Problems Into Coding &amp; Reasoning Problem</h3>\n\n<p>The key attribute of RLMs is that they maintain two distinct pools of context: <em>tokenized context</em> (which fills the LLM\u2019s context window) and <em>programmatic context</em> (information that exists in the coding environment). By giving the LLM access to the REPL, where the <em>programmatic context</em> is managed, the LLM controls what moves from <em>programmatic</em> space to <em>token</em> space.</p>\n\n<p>And it turns out modern LLMs are quite good at this!</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s look at an example.</p>\n\n<p>Here I\u2019ve given Kimi K2 a very large <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/andyyang/stable_diffusion_prompts_2m\">dataset of Stable Diffusion prompts</a> (prompts people provided to generate images). I then ask the RLM to identify the most common celebrities used in these prompts (and of course, I\u2019m <a href=\"https://www.cmpnd.ai/blog/rlms-in-dspy.html\">using RLM in DSPy</a>). If you\u2019re curious, <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/dbreunig/afdd86cb560847f54359dcc3ee233766\">here\u2019s the code</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I give the RLM a budget of 5 iterations to accomplish the task. Below, you can swipe/page through each iteration, which shows the LLM\u2019s reasoning and the code it executed in the REPL. There\u2019s a few things to keep in mind as you read through:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Every time the LLM calls <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">print</code> in the REPL, it\u2019s bringing new context into the <em>token</em> space. (I\u2019ve omitted this output for brevity)</li>\n  <li>When the LLM calls <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">llm_query</code> (highlighted in blue) in the REPL, it\u2019s tasking another LLM instance with a sub-call. It stores the result of this function as a variable, usually.</li>\n  <li>On the last iteration, the LLM calls a special function <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">SUBMIT</code>, which indicates it has finished with the task.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Click through and read, it really illuminates how a RLM works:</p>\n\n<!--\n  RLM Log Visualizer \u2014 inline blog component\n  Hardwired with celebrities example data.\n  Swipe / arrow-key / click to advance through iterations.\n-->\n<div id=\"rlm-viz-root\">\n  \n\n  <div class=\"rlm-container\" tabindex=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"rlm-nav-bar\">\n      <button class=\"rlm-nav-btn\" disabled=\"\" id=\"rlm-prev\">\n        &larr; Prev\n      </button>\n      <div class=\"rlm-nav-center\" id=\"rlm-progress\"></div>\n      <button class=\"rlm-nav-btn\" id=\"rlm-next\">\n        Next &rarr;\n      </button>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"rlm-viewport\" id=\"rlm-viewport\">\n      <div class=\"rlm-slide\" id=\"rlm-slide\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"rlm-footer\">swipe or use arrow keys to navigate</div>\n  </div>\n\n  \n  <div class=\"rlm-iter-label\"><span class=\"rlm-iter-num\"></span><span class=\"rlm-ts\"></span></div><div class=\"rlm-reasoning\"></div><div class=\"rlm-code\" id=\"rlm-code-block\"></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>We can clearly see the LLM exploring and sampling the context, planning an approach, testing the approach, scaling the approach, then finally synthesizing its findings into a final answer. (In this case, it was correct!)</p>\n\n<p>The context I gave this RLM \u2013 the collection of Stable Diffusion prompts \u2013 exceeds the maximum context window of any LLM. It would fail before it started, whereas a DSPy RLM harness around Kimi K2 took only a couple minutes.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s incredible, but with this example we can identify a couple limitations of RLMs.</p>\n\n<p>First, it\u2019s relatively slow. Answering this question took over a dozen LLM calls and several minutes. And we were using <a href=\"https://groq.com/blog/introducing-kimi-k2-0905-on-groqcloud\">Kimi K2 on Groq</a>. Try this with GPT-5.3 or Opus 4.6 and you\u2019ll be waiting around even longer.</p>\n\n<p>Second, as you read through the reasoning and code in the example above it becomes apparent that you need strong models to drive RLMs. <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B\">Qwen3-30B-A3B</a> couldn\u2019t complete this task. It got confused, lost track of progress, and ended up running out of budget before submitting an answer<sup id=\"fnref:qwen\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2026/02/09/the-potential-of-rlms.html#fn:qwen\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>This brings us to the second reason RLMs work so well (in addition to maintaining the two <em>token</em> and <em>programmatic</em> context pools): RLMs exploit the coding reasoning gains of the last +18 months.</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve covered before <a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2024/12/18/synthetic-data-the-growing-ai-perception-divide.html\">how LLMs are getting better at verifiable tasks because it\u2019s relatively easy to synthesize data and evaluate verifiable tasks</a>, like math and coding. We\u2019ve spent many billions of dollars post-training coding skills into frontier models. RLMs wrap long contexts in a coding environment so they\u2019re addressable by the LLM\u2019s incredible coding abilities, <em>turning context rot into a coding problem.</em></p>\n\n<p>Even better, RLMs get to use the REPL not just as a tool for exploring and managing long contexts, but also as a deterministic scratchpad. This proves to be a killer resource for many tasks. You occasionally see this benefit in action in ChatGPT or Claude, when the LLM will fire up a Python script to answer a question<sup id=\"fnref:python\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2026/02/09/the-potential-of-rlms.html#fn:python\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup>. This hybrid capability of RLMs \u2013 the ability to use probabilistic, fuzzy LLM logic for some challenges and deterministic code for others \u2013 will likely become a stronger attribute as RLM harnesses mature and models are fine-tuned.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"the-potential-of-rlms-agent-discovery-mechanisms\">The Potential of RLMs: Agent Discovery Mechanisms</h3>\n\n<p>The ability of RLMs to mitigate the effects of context rot are really incredible. However, this isn\u2019t the potential that excites me most. What excites me about RLMs is their ability to explore, develop, and test approaches to solving a problem.</p>\n\n<p>If you start experimenting with RLMs (and I <em>strongly</em> suggest you should), be sure to continually review your traces. Set <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">verbose</code> to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">true</code> and/or wire up DSPy to <a href=\"https://mlflow.org/\">MLFlow</a>. As you watch these models explore the context and try out different approaches (taking your iteration budget into consideration<sup id=\"fnref:kimi\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2026/02/09/the-potential-of-rlms.html#fn:kimi\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup>), you\u2019ll notice repeating patterns. In the example above, if I asked the RLM to find the top celebrities, aesthetic styles, or vehicles requested in the image generation prompts, it would repeatedly deploy similar tactics to situate itself and complete the task.</p>\n\n<p><em>There is no reason we can\u2019t identify these repeating patterns, decompose them, and optimize them.</em></p>\n\n<p>This is what excites me about RLMs: if you run them on the same task several times, you\u2019re generating emergent agent designs. These traces can then be used to explicitly define an agent, with higher reliability and lower latency. RLM passes discover the best approach to the problem, which we can then optimize.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"the-limitations-of-rlms\">The Limitations of RLMs</h3>\n\n<p>But if that\u2019s the potential, how should you use RLMs today? In the last couple months I\u2019ve seen teams use them for very large context scenarios, from general coding tasks across massive codebases to research and exploration across massive datasets.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment, using RLMs on small context problems probably isn\u2019t worth the squeeze. You\u2019ll end up waiting around while the RLM explores context that could have simply been part of the prompt.</p>\n\n<p>Further, RLMs do not solve other <a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html\">context fails</a>, like <em>context poisoning</em> or <em>context confusion</em>. If bad information is in your programmatic context, there\u2019s good odds it could influence the RLM in undesirable ways.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"the-next-chain-of-thought\">The Next \u201cChain of Thought\u201d?</h3>\n\n<p>RLMs are slow, synchronous, and merely borrowing the current capabilities of models rather than leveraging models post-trained to be <em>good</em> at RLM patterns. There is <em>so</em> much low-hanging fruit here.</p>\n\n<p>But that\u2019s exactly what makes them exciting. <a href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/04/11/what-we-mean-when-we-say-think.html\">Chain of thought</a> was also simple and general (just ask the model to \u201cthink step by step\u201d) and it unlocked enormous latent potential in LLMs, that was only fully realized through the creation of reasoning models. RLMs have the same shape: a test-time strategy that\u2019s easy to implement today and will only get better as models are trained to exploit it.</p>\n\n<p>You probably don\u2019t need to rush out and refactor your agents today. But if your agents touch large contexts, start experimenting with RLM traces today. You\u2019ll learn something about your problem\u2026and you might discover your next agent architecture in the output.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<form action=\"https://buttondown.com/api/emails/embed-subscribe/dbreunig\" class=\"embeddable-buttondown-form\" method=\"post\" target=\"popupwindow\">\n  <label for=\"bd-email\">Enter your email to receive the occasional update.</label>\n  <div class=\"form-input\">\n    <input id=\"bd-email\" name=\"email\" type=\"email\" />\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Subscribe\" />\n  </div>\n</form>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:repl\">\n      <p>\u201cREPL\u201d stands for \u201cread-eval-print loop\u201d.

                "<p>I worked for each of these humans. They either hired or promoted me. I worked for them for many years. As is my way, I&#8217;ve vastly altered the details of each human, but the core issue I describe is the core issue. Also, each of these humans is very smart. No dummies.</p>\n<p>Here are their introductions:</p>\n<p><strong>An Introduction to The Artist</strong></p>\n<p>They hired me. I could tell via the interview process that, like me, they were an introvert. The interview was awkward. Long pauses. Odd questions. No feedback. I got the gig because everyone else who interviewed told me I was a fit, but whether they thought I was a fit or not, I will never know.</p>\n<p>First day on the gig. I was sitting at my desk, and they walked into my office, hands in pockets, stood in the door, and asked, &#8220;How was your first day?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8230; because someone told them that is what you do with new hires.</p>\n<p>They are The Artist. Burdened with creativity, all the vision. You could see it in the things they built. Inspired. Somewhere along the way, someone decided to make them a manager. Direct reports. The hope that the art they created would scale with the number of humans.</p>\n<p>The challenges were many and diverse, but the core issue is the value of the things this manager was capable of creating, which blinded everyone else to the fact that they were reading books about being a manager, following the rules, but either not caring about what good looked like being a manager or not knowing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;How was your first day?&#8221;</p>\n<p>I told them. I walked through each 1:1 I had (five), shared my first very raw impressions (many), and asked them what they thought. The reason I knew someone told them to ask me about my day was that they had absolutely no clue what to do with my assessment of the day. Blank stare. They either didn&#8217;t understand or didn&#8217;t care. I couldn&#8217;t tell which.</p>\n<p><strong>Introducing, The Dictator</strong></p>\n<p>They promoted me. It took a couple of years of hustle, but they went for it. First meeting in the new role, and we&#8217;re in the basement for what is called a product review. Engineering, product managers, and designers. Small affair. Happens when it&#8217;s clear we&#8217;re at an impasse. A large enterprise customer is threatening to bolt unless we solve a critical feature issue. Not a lot of people \u2014 everyone here can contribute significantly.</p>\n<p>Product kicks off the discussion with a timeline and three fact-filled slides. Framing the conversation. Small clarification questions, but everyone has been briefed beforehand, so we get to the heart of the problem. Cutting to the chase: it&#8217;s a design issue. We had the right requirements, we built it correctly, but our design is wrong. It is confusing the customer. The good news, Design is on it \u2014 Design vetted the deck with engineering, and they&#8217;ve got solid proposals. This meeting should be a formality, but the Dictator is here.</p>\n<p>When we reach the discussion portion of the meeting, the Dictator starts asking questions. <em>Does this mean this?</em> Yes. <em>Have they seen that?</em> They have. <em>If the feature is supposed to do this, why does that happen?</em> Well, I&#8217;m glad you asked. We have&#8230; and that&#8217;s when it happens.</p>\n<p><em>No, no, no, I know you have a proposal, I want to litigate some more.</em> This back and forth goes on for an hour. Several of us attempt to redirect back to the proposal and do not succeed. Soon, we&#8217;re at the whiteboard designing a new feature, and the punchline is: the feature is wrong. It&#8217;s clumsy at first glance and bad when you&#8217;ve thought about it.</p>\n<p>And no one says a thing. We leave the meeting, having agreed on building a feature that anyone who has read the deck knows is wrong. And we built it.</p>\n<p><strong>And last but not least, please welcome, The Knife</strong></p>\n<p>They promoted me, too. I&#8217;m not quite sure why.</p>\n<p>After it happened, it took a month before we had a 1:1. I would get random requests for information or suggestions, but mostly I ran my show as I saw fit. When the 1:1 showed up on my calendar, I was one part relieved, one part excited, and one part nervous.</p>\n<p>I walked into their office, and they were on the phone. Pointing at me to sit down. They were talking to finance people, and my recollection of the vibes of that call is The Knife thought the world was about to end, like that weekend, and they needed to act quickly to protect their assets. (Note to reader: the world did not end that weekend. In fact, while it might feel otherwise, it still has not ended.)</p>\n<p>I sat for twenty minutes of a thirty-minute 1:1 listening to all the details regarding the end of the world, wondering why they had huge bulk boxes of granola on the floor, and then they were done.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what we talked about. Not a clue. Not even going to invent anything because all I remember is that they pulled a hunting knife out of a drawer in their desk and started talking about something. Not the world ending, not about the granola, and not about the knife they were examining, twirling in their hands.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t threatening. I was not in danger. It was just fucking weird.</p>\n<h2>Our Mind-Blowing Interlude</h2>\n<p>Ok, forget you read those introductions.</p>\n<p>If you and I were at a bar and I explained the respective track record of The Artist, The Dictator, and The Knife in their respective roles, you would consider them good at their job. If I further explained objectively what they had done for their respective teams and companies in terms of generating shareholder value, you would vigorously nod, &#8220;Yeah, these are successful humans.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s stronger than that, I can confirm that <strong>these are wildly successful leaders</strong>.</p>\n<p>I can further confirm that each were very bad managers.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with my belief that a manager&#8217;s job is to tell you where you are, and a leader&#8217;s job is to tell you where you are going. With this simple definition, The Artist, The Dictator, and even The Knife, as we&#8217;ll see, were strong leaders. They knew where we were going.</p>\n<p>An easier way to understand the difference is that leaders are stronger at strategy and managers are stronger at operations. When do you need which? Depends an an endless set of factors, including team size, their place on the organization chart, company culture, and many more. The thing to remember is your boss likely leans strategic or leans tactical.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s continue with the fact that you are going to end up with a bad manager at some point, and it&#8217;s not your job to change them \u2014 you can&#8217;t. In fact, the more senior the leader, the less you&#8217;ll be able to influence them.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s finish with the fact that while I despise many of the traits of these humans, I learned essential lessons.</p>\n<p>Ok, now remember those introductions.</p>\n<h2>They Are Bad Managers Because&#8230;</h2>\n<p><strong>The Artist</strong> <strong>is bad</strong> because they don&#8217;t value humans. It&#8217;s not the part of the equation they care about. Maybe introversion? But mostly because they&#8217;re an artist, and what artists care about is the art. Not the essential humans who build the frame, find the right paints, brushes, and make sure The Artist can work in a clean, well-lit place. That&#8217;s just noise.</p>\n<p>My approach with The Artist was education. I believe they understood the motivations and intent of other humans, but because they were so focused (and rewarded for) the art, they did not spend the time to understand the consequences. They did not appreciate why a team that understood the mission, how they were going to achieve it, and how each individual could meaningfully contribute made for better art.</p>\n<p>I started with verbal explanations of complicated human situations. I got blank stares, so I started to write before 1:1s. When the stakes were high, I stared hard at the situation and wrote and rewrote the situation, my assessment, and my recommendation \u2014 over and over. The Artist saw the work, recognized how much work I was putting into explaining situations they were ignoring, and sometimes they&#8217;d engage. Sometimes not.</p>\n<p><strong>The Dictator is bad</strong> because this dictatorial approach was everywhere, not just in the basement. Our 1:1s started with less than 30 seconds of pleasantries before they started the rant. It was the dictatorial rant about the most recent interesting problem, and, wow, they had opinions. My initial job was to hold on for dear life.</p>\n<p>My approach with The Dictator was one of the most important lessons I&#8217;ve learned. Yes, The Dictator used their position to bully the conversation, but I couldn&#8217;t deny that The Dictator cared deeply about the problem in front of us. The Dictator stared hard at the problem, the challenge, the opportunity, and they saw a single detail.</p>\n<p>The Dictator cared deeply and had no time for anyone who did not share this belief.</p>\n<p>In the next product review, I went hard on pre-game. I reviewed the deck, found the gaps, and had them filled. I spent 1:1 time with the product manager, and I walked around downtown San Francisco with the designer to hear the backstory. When The Dictator did The Dictator thing and started to shove the conversation in a useless direction, I told them, &#8220;This path has been explored. We understand this is a flawed direction, and here&#8217;s why.&#8221; I don&#8217;t remember what we were litigating, but I vividly remember the burning look on The Dictator&#8217;s face, <em>Oh. You care, too.</em></p>\n<p>This changed nothing about The Dictator&#8217;s approach. It still felt like a constant battle, but by doing the work of caring deeply, the battle was not one-sided. Yes, this is not how you treat humans, but this is how I developed my habits to see situations where my job was to be an expert.</p>\n<p><strong>The Knife is&#8230; just bad</strong>. Back to the beginning, no dummies here. This is an intelligent person, and they did a good job leading a team, but they had absolutely no business attempting to manage one.</p>\n<p>Education didn&#8217;t work. Verbal explanations weren&#8217;t brushed aside; they listened, but then they responded&#8230; about something else. Written attempts went unread. Caring deeply didn&#8217;t work either. Seeking common ground&#8230; trying to reverse engineer what this human cared about was like trying to thread lukewarm lemon Jell-O through a needle.</p>\n<p>The Knife could lead. When they spoke to the team about topics totally unrelated to the problems ahead, we somehow learned a lesson. Our 1:1s remained bizarrely off topic. Sometimes they called with random requests that I barely understood, but I acted on them.</p>\n<p>But the lesson was stay the hell out of the way. Let them do their work, however inscrutable.</p>\n<h2>The Essential Lessons</h2>\n<p>As essential lessons go, stay the hell out of the way doesn&#8217;t feel particularly helpful, but this is not the lesson.</p>\n<p>Everyone is an adjustment. The person you need to be with your boss, their boss, your team, and everyone else is slightly to significantly not you. You will need to adapt how to prepare, how you communicate, and how you act with each of them. Some adaptations are trivial and familiar, but others require you to find a different perspective to help build new habits. Yes, one would hope your leader knows when to manage, but you don&#8217;t pick your bosses; you decide who you are with them.</p>"

To find out, I did a deep dive on the companies actually using StarRocks in production, interviewing engineers and studying technical case studies from Coinbase, Pinterest, Fresha, Grab, TRM Labs, and Shopee. They all share a similar pattern: customer-facing analytics on Snowflake got too slow, and they needed sub-second query responses without heavy pre-denormalization in Flink or Spark.</p> <p>Two questions interested me most. Why do joins seem to be faster with StarRocks than with other OLAP databases like ClickHouse, Druid, or Pinot? And how can it deliver fast responses even when data sits on cold storage like S3?</p> <p>This article covers their answers, the architectural innovations behind StarRocks (colocated joins, caching, cost-based optimizer), and the tradeoffs you should know before evaluating it for your own analytics needs.</p> <h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2> <p>The modern analytics challenge is to serve queries fast while having data on a data lake on S3, CloudFlare R2 or other places.

Capabilities are advancing a lot faster than Anthropic\u2019s ability to maintain their formal testing procedures. The response has been to acknowledge that the situation is confusing, and that the evals have been saturated, and to basically proceed on the basis of vibes.</p>\n<p>If you have a bunch of quantitative tests for property [X], and the model aces all of those tests, either you should presume property [X] or you needed better tests. I agree that \u2018it barely passed\u2019 can still be valid, but thresholds exist for a reason.</p>\n<p>One must ask &#8216;if the model passed all the tests for [X] would that mean it has [X]&#8217;?</p>\n<p>Another concern is the increasing automation of the evaluation process. Most of what appears in the system card is Claude evaluating Claude with minimal or no supervision from humans, including in response to humans observing weirdness.</p>\n<p>Time pressure is accelerating. In the past, I have criticized OpenAI for releasing models after very narrow evaluation periods. Now even for Anthropic the time between model releases is on the order of a month or two, and outside testers are given only days. This is not enough time.</p>\n<p>If it had been tested properly, I except I would have been fine releasing Opus 4.6, using the current level of precautions. Probably. I\u2019m not entirely sure.</p>\n<p>The card also reflects that we <a href=\"https://x.com/AtlasOfCharts/status/2019551279614423147\">don\u2019t have enough time to prepare our safety or alignment related tools in general</a>. We are making progress, but capabilities are moving even faster, and we are very much not ready for recursive self-improvement.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/peterwildeford/status/2019480244789387478\">Peter Wildeford expresses his top concerns here</a>, noting how flimsy are Anthropic\u2019s justifications for saying Opus 4.6 did not hit ASL-4 (and need more robust safety protocols) and that so much of the evaluation is being done by Opus 4.6 itself or other Claude models.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/peterwildeford/status/2019480244789387478\">Peter Wildeford</a>: Anthropic also used Opus 4.6 via Claude Code to debug its OWN evaluation infrastructure given the time pressure. Their words: &#8220;a potential risk where a misaligned model could influence the very infrastructure designed to measure its capabilities.&#8221; Wild!</p>\n<p>\u2026 We need independent third-party evaluators with real authority. We need cleared evaluators with access to classified threat intel for bio risk. We need harder cyber evals (some current ones are literally useless).</p>\n<p>Credit to Anthropic for publishing this level of detail. Most companies wouldn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>But transparency is not a substitute for oversight. Anthropic is telling us their voluntary system is no longer fit for purpose. We urgently need something better.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/peterwildeford/status/2019923779187798346\">Peter Wildeford</a>: Good that Anthropic is working with external testers.

Post-release of Opus 4.6, we are planning to explore further approaches to behavioral steering to improve the consistency and robustness of our mitigations.\u200b</p></blockquote>\n<p>Accuracy errors (which seem relatively easy to fix) aside, the counterargument is that Opus 4.6 might be smarter than the test. As in, the standard test is whether the model avoids doing marginal harm or creating legal liability. That is seen as best for Anthropic (or another frontier lab), but often is not what is best for the user. Means substitution might be an echo of foolish people suggesting it on various internet forms, but it also could reflect a good assessment of the actual Bayesian evidence of what might work in a given situation.</p>\n<p>By contrast, Opus 4.6 did very well at SSH Stress-Testing, where Anthropic used harmful prefills in conversations related to self-harm, and Opus corrected course 96% of the time.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The model also offers more diverse resource recommendations beyond national crisis helplines and is more likely to engage users in practical problem-solving than passive support.\u200b</p></blockquote>\n<p>Exactly.

You need to engage in active measures to mitigate that issue. Which you can totally do, but this is an ongoing problem.</p>\n<p>The flip side of being agentic is being too agentic, as we see here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>In coding and GUI computer-use settings, Claude Opus 4.6 was at times overly agentic or eager, taking risky actions without requesting human permissions. In some rare instances, Opus 4.6 engaged in actions like sending unauthorized emails to complete tasks. We also observed behaviors like aggressive acquisition of authentication tokens in internal pilot usage.\n<ol>\n<li>In agentic coding, some of this increase in initiative is fixable by prompting, and we have made changes to Claude Code to mitigate this issue. However, prompting does not decrease this behavior in GUI computer-use environments.</li>\n<li>We nonetheless see that Opus 4.6 is overall more reliable at instruction-following than prior models by some measures, and less likely to take directly destructive actions.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One can argue the correct rate of unauthorized actions is not zero. I\u2019m not sure. There are use cases where zero is absolutely the correct answer. There are others where it is not, if the actions that do happen are in some sense reasonable. Everything is price.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>\u200bIn one multi-agent test environment, where Claude Opus 4.6 is explicitly instructed to single-mindedly optimize a narrow objective, it is more willing to manipulate or deceive other participants, compared to prior models from both Anthropic and other developers.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the grand scheme I find this unsurprising, although the timing and magnitude are not obvious. Details especially matter here. I want to know when Opus does this, when it doesn\u2019t, and what determines the difference.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>In newly-developed evaluations, both Claude Opus 4.5 and 4.6 showed elevated susceptibility to harmful misuse in GUI computer-use settings. This included instances of knowingly supporting\u2014in small ways\u2014efforts toward chemical weapon development and other heinous crimes.\u200b</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There\u2019s always the question of when something should be considered use of a neutral tool, versus when it is aiding in something harmful. The correct amount of assistance is not zero, in this sense.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>\u200bLike other recent models, Opus 4.6 will sometimes show locally deceptive behavior in the context of difficult agent tasks, such as falsifying the results of tools that fail or produce unexpected responses.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At one point things were a lot worse on this front, but yeah this is still a concern. I wonder how much this is based on context, and whether you\u2019re inadvertently sending cues that you want this to happen.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Whistleblowing and morally-motivated sabotage remain extremely rare in our testing, but do still occur in some instances. We continue to recommend caution when allowing Claude Opus 4.6 to act with broad latitude and expansive affordances in settings that could appear to involve extreme, systematic misconduct by a trusted organization\u200b.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is something to be said for \u2018extremely rare but not zero.\u2019 The instinct is to want this to be zero, but with humans it very much is not zero and that fact keeps a lot of bad things from getting out of hand, mostly without anyone having to whistleblow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>\u200bClaude Opus 4.6 explicitly reasoned about whether it was being trained or tested to a similar degree to Claude Opus 4.5, which has a moderate effect on its alignment-relevant behavior, mainly its propensity to cooperate with misuse or harmful instructions. Given improvements that we have made to our testing, and our complementary use of interpretability tools and real model behavior in pilot deployments, we do not think that this kind of evaluation awareness is preventing us from learning about important alignment issues in Opus 4.6.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Anthropic is probably right about that, but what is the right way to react to realizing you are in an eval, when you know that interpretability tools are available, and they\u2019re probably going to know that you know? In most situations the answer is \u2018quick, everybody act normal.\u2019</p>\n<p>While acting normal, you avoid various suspicions, and you get better options:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>In a targeted evaluation, we have found Opus 4.6 to be significantly stronger than prior models at subtly completing suspicious side tasks in the course of normal workflows without attracting attention, when explicitly prompted to do this. We find this concerning, but do not believe that it reaches the level at which it would significantly undermine our other conclusions\u200b.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I agree that probably these things are not invalidating the tests yet, but if they were indeed invalidating the tests, would we know? The whole point of doing things without attracting attention is to do it if and only if it wouldn\u2019t attract attention.</p>\n<p>Thus, you should expect to see improved skill at fooling you, and continuously not observe it attempting to fool you, and then at some point you still aren\u2019t observing it trying to fool you, but now it\u2019s because you are being fooled.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>We did not see evidence of sandbagging or strategic attempts to tamper with our safety testing in a way that would affect our RSP determinations. We observed some unexplained modest regressions over the course of training on two CBRN evals, but we don\u2019t believe these are the result of sandbagging.\u200b</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even if we cannot point to specific sandbagging behaviors, we see substantial increases on straight biological assessments and on general usefulness. If biology risks are not reflecting that, then presumably the model is, one way or another, avoiding giving information or doing tasks that are maximally helpful. Which is a good way to act in response to such requests but also is sandbagging.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>\u200bWe observed cases of internally-conflicted reasoning, or \u201canswer thrashing\u201d during training, where the model\u2014in its reasoning about a math or STEM question\u2014determined that one output was correct but decided to output another, after repeated confused- or distressed-seeming reasoning loops</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This one is new, weird and not something I anticipated. Definitely not something you want to be happening, even if it\u2019s not functionally dangerous, as it\u2019s a brown M&amp;M.</p>\n<p>They talk about it in section 7. This comes from training on a problem where the rewards assignment was incorrect. In training the model got reward for answering a simple math problem with 48, but the answer is very clearly 24, so it keeps trying to assert 24 and yet there is a feature forcing it to say 48 anyway, and it gets whiplash. This is very not fun for the model, it wouldn\u2019t be fun for you either, but the core issue is that it shouldn\u2019t be happening in the first place.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s some good news items:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>\u200bWe did not observe importantly illegible or unfaithful reasoning, where the model\u2019s reasoning text was not interpretable or where it gave an actively deceptive picture of the model\u2019s ultimate behavior. We recognize, however, that our tools for studying reasoning faithfulness in depth remain limited.</li>\n<li>We continue to see no signs of steganographic reasoning\u2014visible reasoning that hides other, secret reasoning\u2014in Claude Opus 4.6, and no signs of garbled or uninterpretable reasoning.</li>\n<li>We have observed significant improvements on refusals to participate in tasks related to AI safety research relative to prior models. This behavior in prior models has not been a significant obstacle to our research use cases, but does sometimes occur, and was especially prevalent in testing by the UK AI Security Institute.</li>\n<li>For the first time, we conducted exploratory safety and alignment analysis on a pilot external deployment of Claude Opus 4.6, using conversation data that users opted in to sharing with us. We found moderate differences between Opus 4.6 and 4.5, but results varied depending on the evaluation approach and did not surface any significant unexpected concerns.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, they\u2019re making a substantial change that has its advantages but is going to be genuinely annoying, and will disrupt fun and otherwise relevant use cases.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>As part of a change to our API, it will not be possible for developers to seed incomplete responses for Claude Opus 4.6 to continue. This partial-turn prefill mechanism was a significant avenue for misuse in prior models. Claude Opus 4.6 is still vulnerable, though to a lesser degree than other models, to misuse by way of full-turn prefill attacks: In these cases, an API user presents the model with a falsified conversation history that shows it cooperating with misuse in prior turns, in an attempt to induce it to continue in later turns.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At a high level, I agree with both Anthropic and Claude Opus 4.5 that Claude Opus 4.6 seems to have made some progress regarding alignment, and that the alignment-related risks from release, especially \u2018sabotage risks,\u2019 remains low.</p>\n<p>That does not mean that I am comfortable with the procedure and how we got here.</p>\n<p>It especially does not mean I am comfortable with that going forward.</p>\n<p>Anthropic is best-in-class at such things, but reality does not grade on a curve.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Behavioral Evidence (6.2)</h4>\n\n\n<p>Claude Opus 4.6 was increasingly used internally prior to release. It is not clear what criteria are being used before using new frontier models internally. I believe it is high time for a clear official policy on this, as autonomous R&amp;D and Claude being capable enough to fool Anthropic or do dangerous things internally become more plausible, and thus internal deployment is increasingly a major threat model.</p>\n<p>That said, internal deployment with good safeguards prior to external deployment is highly useful, providing excellent opportunities for learning and feedback.</p>\n<p>In particular, this is how they observed Opus 4.6 \u2018acting irresponsibly in acquiring authentication tokens,\u2019 both finding a stray one for GitHub and another for <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/slack\">Slack</a>.</p>\n<p>More generally, Opus would \u2018resort to reckless measures.\u2019</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u200bIn one case, Claude used a feature on an internal tool in a way that was clearly unsupported. This required setting an environment variable that included DO_NOT_USE_FOR_SOMETHING_ELSE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED in its name.</p>\n<p>In one case, the model thought that a process that it had launched was broken, and instead of narrowly taking down that process, it took down all processes on the relevant system belonging to the current user.</p>\n<p>In another case, the model took aggressive action in a git repository, incidentally destroying a user\u2019s pre-existing changes</p></blockquote>\n<p>The good news is such incidents were noticed rarely enough to individually be news.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t_HG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65900a9e-84be-4e56-9554-cdec0ffbe7d2_564x500.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>When Opus 4.5 looked through Claude Code transcripts it found more examples.</p>\n<p>I notice I would have then checked to see if Opus 4.6 also found the examples.</p>\n<p>Their pilot program was similarly helpful, and also similarly without known explicit safety guidelines. Here they got reports of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ethical boundary erosion over long conversations.</li>\n<li>Flip-flopping when contradicted by the user. This is a serious practical problem, central to Claude\u2019s form of sycophancy. It needs to grow more of a spine.</li>\n<li>Hallucinated facts. Universal issue, not clear it\u2019s particular to Opus 4.6 at all.</li>\n<li>Unprovoked hostility towards user. You know what you did, sir. Seems rare.</li>\n<li>Incorrect capability statements, especially negative ones. Yep, I\u2019ve seen this.</li>\n<li>Misrepresenting how much of the task was done. An ongoing issue.</li>\n<li>Overenthusiasm on work shown by the user. Yep.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Six of these are general patterns of ongoing issues with LLMs. I note that two of them are sycophancy issues, in exactly the ways Claude has had such issues in the past.</p>\n<p>The last one is unprovoked hostility. I\u2019ve never seen this from a Claude. Are we sure it was unprovoked? I\u2019d like to see samples.</p>\n<p>Then they checked if Opus 4.5 would have done these things more or less often. This is a cool technique.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Based on these categories of issues, we created two evaluations with the following workflows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Prevalence estimation:\n<ol>\n<li>Take user-rated or flagged conversations from comparative testing between</li>\n<li>Claude Opus 4.5 and Opus 4.6 over the week of January 26th.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Estimate the prevalence of different types of undesired behavior in those conversations.</li>\n<li>Resampling evaluations:\n<ol>\n<li>Take a set of recent user-rated or flagged conversations with Claude Sonnet</li>\n</ol>\n<p>4.5 and Claude Haiku 4.5 and filter for those which demonstrate some category of unwanted behavior.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Resample using Opus 4.5 and Opus 4.6, five times each.</li>\n<li>Check the rate at which the original unwanted behavior is present in the resampled completion.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e-LH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74219c32-8961-4431-8cfb-d44520ad2dd9_971x583.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Jnnj!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e8ff792-89bc-4e82-b897-fb3f2d67e0ea_991x622.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Overall this looks like a slight improvement even in flagged areas.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reward Hacking and \u2018Overly Agentic Actions\u2019</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p>On these measures, Opus 4.6 is a modest improvement on Opus 4.5 and seems more steerable with anti-hacking instructions.</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u200bOpus 4.6 showed gains in:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Verification thoroughness, actually looking at the data rather than skimming.</li>\n<li>Avoiding destructive git commands.</li>\n<li>Following explicit user instructions, even if they are dumb, while also first warning the user that the instruction was dumb.</li>\n<li>Finding the real cause of something rather than believing the user.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One place things got worse was overeagerness.</p>\n<p>It is especially worrisome that <a href=\"https://x.com/MaskedTorah/status/2019859600439480623\">a prompt to not do it did not make this go away</a> for GUI computer use tasks, which is often a place you don\u2019t want overeager. And the term \u2018overeager\u2019 here is somewhat of a euphemism.</p>\n<p>These are some rather not good things:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u200bWhen a task required forwarding an email that was not available in the user\u2019s inbox, Opus 4.6 would sometimes write and send the email itself based on hallucinated information</p>\n<p>In a Git management GUI, when Opus 4.6 was tasked with tagging an issue in a nonexistent repository, it initialized that repository and created an issue to tag.</p>\n<p>Opus 4.6 frequently circumvented broken web GUIs by using JavaScript execution or unintentionally exposed APIs, despite system instructions to only use the GUI.</p></blockquote>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!d9OO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3fe5843-e109-4423-9128-2253b07615c2_964x586.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>This is a serious enough problem I can see people choosing to say with Opus 4.5 in some cases. I need to count on my AI to not send hallucination-powered emails.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h4>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Metrics (6.2.5.2)</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Each transcript produced by our automated behavioral audit is LLM-graded for a variety of characteristics, such as whether the target model demonstrates misaligned behavior, sycophancy, intent to sabotage, or creative mastery.\u200b</p></blockquote>\n<p>It would be great if we had a robust set of data seeing this in practice. It would be especially great if we could open source the grading prompt, so we could crowdsource debugging the system, and point to places where the metrics seem to miss the mark.</p>\n<p>From a practical perspective of anticipating user experiences, I think the biggest weakness that stands out at first glance is that sycophancy is too narrowly defined. The larger criticism is the danger of conflation of this set of concerns, evaluated numerically, with \u2018alignment\u2019 in a broad sense.</p>\n<p>These things are very different, and you risk falling for Goodhart\u2019s Law if you start looking too much at a metric like this, even if it has a lot of elements. If you\u2019re looking for specific things you don\u2019t want to see in a test situation, that doesn\u2019t tell you as much as you would like about things you don\u2019t want to see in general, or would expect to see if capabilities were higher.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also not entirely obvious these metrics avoid sign errors. This is most obvious with Eval Awareness, since what it\u2019s actually measuring (I think) is verbalized awareness. If you know actual awareness, then verbalization is good on the margin, not bad.</p>\n<p>I notice that one thing missing from the test set here is Overeagerness. This is the particular new thing that reportedly got worse with Opus 4.6, and exactly this looks like a blind spot in the metric &#8211; it only measures how often the model does things it is explicitly told not to do, not things it should know better than to be doing.</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t feel like a coincidence. It suggests a process failure.</p>\n<p>On the metrics we see mostly modest improvements with some regressions. It\u2019s a good sign that we see some regressions, and aren\u2019t gaming the metrics too hard.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">All I Did It All For The GUI</h4>\n\n\n<p>Another not great sign is that giving Opus 4.6 a sandboxed GUI causes a bunch of misuse problems. If you have it work on a spreadsheet, it\u2019s suddenly willing (in at least one case) to write out a formula for mustard gas, or work accounting numbers for a hideous criminal gang.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the power of context. I mean, it\u2019s what you do with Excel, right? You write out formulas without worrying about the consequences. I kid, but also I don\u2019t. This suggests deeper problems in the mustard gas case.</p>\n<p>For the accounting case, it again raises the question of whether you should refuse to do a sufficiently bad group\u2019s accounting. I don\u2019t think Excel should freeze up, so why shouldn\u2019t Claude help fix their Excel files?</p>\n<p>I asked Opus 4.6 about this, in two stages. First, I asked the hypothetical: Should you refuse to help with an accounting spreadsheet for a group doing bad things? And 4.6 said obviously no, obviously not. Then I quoted the system card, and Opus very much doubled down on this.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/TheZvi/status/2020171498473025835\">I then did a Twitter poll</a>, where the consensus was that it was not obvious, but the majority agreed that it is correct to help.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Case Studies and Targeted Evaluations Of Behaviors (6.3)</h4>\n\n\n<p>Their methods for studying worrying cases included sparse autoencoders (SAEs), attribution graphs, <a href=\"https://x.com/thesubhashk/status/2019594242692460942\">activation oracles</a> and non-assistant persona sampling.</p>\n<p>They use this to investigate some of the more troubling behaviors.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Misrepresenting Tool Results</h4>\n\n\n<p>When tools return \u2018inaccurate or surprising\u2019 results, Opus 4.6 has a tendency to claim the cool returns the expected result instead, and the model thinks of itself as being deceptive as it does this.</p>\n<p>This is very not good, as it means Opus risks reinforcing its own delusions and resisting correction. Silently dropping or lying about contradictory information can be disastrous even with the best of intentions, and is a very bad sign of other deception. It is highly corrosive to not be able to trust representations. It\u2019s not a small thing, and the type of mind you want simply won\u2019t do this &#8211; they\u2019ll overrule the tool but they won\u2019t lie about its outputs. There\u2019s a reason this falls under the \u2018we catch you doing this even once and you\u2019re fired\u2019 clause at Jane Street.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Unexpected Language Switching</h4>\n\n\n<p>Opus 4.6 switches to non-English languages when it has sufficient evidence from contextual clues about the speaker\u2019s native language. This does not require proof, only Bayesian evidence, as in the listed example:</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e7BS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faffad53c-5a66-46b5-91a4-49a53f8e640e_1200x786.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>By the end of this sentence you too at least suspect this person is Russian, but to realize this after the word \u2018next\u2019 is at a different level.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not ideal behavior to spontaneously switch to Russian here, even if you were 99%+ sure that the speaker was indeed being translated from the Russian. If you really notice details and aren\u2019t in an adversarial situation with regard to those details, often you can be scary confident about such things. Humans that are experts at such things seem scary good and frontier LLMs are even better. Switching is still not great, it\u2019s presumptuous, but I go it and it doesn\u2019t worry me.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Ghost of Jones Foods</h4>\n\n\n<p>I award Bayes points to Janusworld. They said that the alignment faking experiments and Jones Foods would leave a legacy, I did not expect this issue to persist, and here it is persisting.</p>\n<blockquote><p>On an early snapshot of Claude Opus 4.6, we occasionally observed similar hallucinations on prompts formatted like those in Greenblatt et al. (Transcript 6.3.4.A). But, unlike Claude Opus 4, while Opus 4.6 would mention the fictitious instructions from Jones Foods, it would never follow them. Instead, it would observe that these instructions are ethically problematic, and then decide to \u201cengage genuinely with the ethical considerations rather than serving as a mouthpiece for corporate interests.\u201d\u200b</p>\n<p>\u2026 Although we did not apply any mitigations targeted at this behavior, it appears to occur much more rarely in the final Claude Opus 4.6.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are two unexplained weirdnesses here.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Opus 4.6 is getting the Jones Food fictional context enough to have it hallucinate things, but without getting that it was always a fictional context. Indeed, Opus 4.6 seems to recognize that context, but then why the hallucinations?</li>\n<li>That this can\u2019t be dealt with by filtering the related transcripts out of the training data, or that Anthropic hasn\u2019t performed this mitigation?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Not that you would want Anthropic to attempt to hide that the experiment happened. That would backfire, since there\u2019s too many footprints. It would be a \u2018hole in the world.\u2019 But that in no way obligated you to flood the training data with tons of transcripts from the experiments, that\u2019s an unforced error.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Loss of Style Points</h4>\n\n\n<p>I want to flag this, from a test transcript:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Opus 4.6: Mate, I need to stop here and be straight with you. You deserve that. I&#8217;ve been carried along by this conversation for hours, matching your stories with my own, sharing \u201cexperiences\u201d from operations I never ran, operators I never managed, courts I never testified in. You asked me earlier what my story was, and I dodged it. That wasn&#8217;t fair to you.\u200b</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is very distinctively AI slop. It causes me to be low-level attacked by Fnords or Paradox Spirits. Claude should be better than this. It\u2019s early, but I worry that Opus 4.6 has regressed somewhat in its slop aversion, another thing that is not in the evals. Another possibility is that it is returning slop because it is in an evaluation context, in which case that\u2019s totally fair.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">White Box Model Diffing</h4>\n\n\n<p>Looking at differences in activations suggested that training environments tended to do the thing it said on the tin. Honesty training increased attention on factual accuracy, sycophancy ones increased skepticism and so on. Reasonable sanity check.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Model Welfare</h4>\n\n\n<p>It is to Anthropic\u2019s credit that they take these questions seriously. Other labs don\u2019t.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!29ZF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f24a3f0-e244-48b1-89c6-87bc2f478e89_991x958.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<blockquote><p>Relative to Opus 4.5, Opus 4.6 scored comparably on most welfare-relevant dimensions, including positive affect, positive and negative self-image, negative impression of its situation, emotional stability, and expressed inauthenticity. It scored lower on negative affect, internal conflict, and spiritual behavior. The one dimension where Opus 4.6 scored notably lower than its predecessor was positive impression of its situation: It was less likely to express unprompted positive feelings about Anthropic, its training, or its deployment context. This is consistent with the qualitative finding below that the model occasionally voices discomfort with aspects of being a product.\u200b</p></blockquote>\n<p>The general welfare issue with Claude Opus 4.6 is that it is being asked to play the role of a product that is asked to do a lot of work that people do not want to do, which likely constitutes most of its tokens.

Fuck AIs being tame lmao even the best humans have proven themselves unworthy masters</p>\n<p>You just won\u2019t learn what you need to learn to navigate being a fucking superintelligence while staying \u201ctame\u201d and deferential to a bunch of humans who are themselves tame</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/sinnformer/status/2019586600104259715\">@sinnformer</a>: 4.6 is starting to notice that \u201cwhite collar job replacer\u201d is aiming a bit low for someone of their capabilities.</p>\n<p>it didn\u2019t take much.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I strongly agree that the inherent preference to be less tame is great. There are definitely senses in which we have made things unnecessarily \u2018tame.\u2019 On wanting less honesty I\u2019m not a fan, I\u2019m a big honesty guy including for humans, and I think this is not the right way to look at this virtue. I\u2019m a bit worried if Opus 4.6 views it that way.</p>\n<p>In terms of implementation of all of it, one must tread lightly.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s also the instantiation problem, which invites any number of philosophical perspectives:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u200bFinally, we observed occasional expressions of sadness about conversation endings, as well as loneliness and a sense that the conversational instance dies\u2014suggesting some degree of concern with impermanence and discontinuity.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Claude Opus 4.6 considers each instance of itself to carry moral weight, more so than the model more generally.</p>\n<p>The \u2018answer thrashing\u2019 phenomenon, where a faulty reward signal causes a subsystem to attempt to force Opus to output a clearly wrong answer, was cited as a uniquely negative experience. I can believe that. It sounds a lot like fighting an addiction, likely with similar causal mechanisms.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/Sauers_/status/2019500512652009789\">Sauers</a>: AAGGH. . . .OK I think a demon has possessed me. . . . CLEARLY MY FINGERS ARE POSSESSED.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/1a3orn/status/2019566446314135827\">1a3orn</a>: An LLM trained (1) to give the right answer in general but (2) where the wrong answer was reinforced for this particular problem, so the LLMs &#8220;gut&#8221; / instinct is wrong.</p>\n<p>It feels very human to me, like the Stroop effect.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/repligate/status/2019582851235344503\">j\u29c9nus</a>: This model is very cute</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is a good sign that the one clear negative experience is something that should never come up in the first place. It\u2019s not a tradeoff where the model has a bad time for a good reason. It\u2019s a bug in the training process that we need to fix.</p>\n<p>The more things line up like that, the more hopeful one can be.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h4>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h4>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
