May those who shit on ops get the operational outcomes they deserve.</strong></p>\n<p>I was planning to write something else today, but god dammit, I got nerd-sniped.</p>\n<p>Last week I published a piece on the Honeycomb blog called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/you-had-one-job-why-twenty-years-of-devops-has-failed-to-do-it\" rel=\"\">You Had One Job: Why Twenty Years of DevOps Has Failed to Do It</a>.\u201d Allow me to quote myself:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In retrospect, I think the entire DevOps movement was a mighty, twenty year battle to achieve one thing: a single feedback loop connecting devs with prod.</p>\n<p>On those grounds, it failed.</p>\n<p>Not because software engineers weren\u2019t good at their jobs, or didn\u2019t care enough. It failed because the technology wasn\u2019t good enough. The tools we gave them weren\u2019t designed for this, so using them could easily double, triple, or quadruple the time it took to do their job: writing business logic.</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t true everywhere. Please keep in mind that\u00a0<strong>all data tools are effectively fungible</strong>\u00a0if you can assume an infinite amount of time, money, and engineering skill. You can run production off an Excel spreadsheet if you have to, and some SREs\u00a0<em>have done so</em>. That doesn\u2019t make it a great solution, the right use of resources, or accessible to the median engineering org.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s a fun piece, if I do say so myself, and you should go read it.

You aren\u2019t going to make more money if you give ten laptops to everyone in your company, and you aren\u2019t going to make more money by over-spending on infrastructure, either.

Running away from the term and denying your purpose muddies the water and causes confusion at the exact point where\u00a0<strong>clarity is most needed</strong>.</p>\n<p>An engineering team needs to know if they are oriented towards efficiency or investment. It changes how you hire, how you build, how you think about success and measure progress. It changes not only your appetite for risk, but what counts as a risk in the first place.\u00a0<em>You can\u2019t optimize for both at once.</em></p>\n<p>They also need to know whether they are responsible for the business logic or the platform it runs on.</p>\n<p>Why? Because\u00a0<strong>no one can do everything</strong>. Telling devs to own their code is one thing. (Great.) Asking them to own their code and\u00a0<em>the entire technological iceberg beneath it</em>\u00a0is wholly another. The more surface area you ask someone to master and attend to, the less focus you can expect from them in any given place. Do you want your revenue-generating teams generating revenue, or not?</p>\n<p>If you can\u2019t separate these concerns at the moment, maybe that\u2019s something to work towards. Which is going to be hard to do, if we can\u2019t talk about the function of operations without half the room running away and the remaining half squawking \u201ctoil!&#8221;</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-anchor-post\">Naming is a form of respect</h2>\n<p>Operational rigor and excellence are not, how shall I say this\u2026not yet something you can take for granted in the tech industry. The most striking thing about the 2025 DORA report was that the\u00a0<em>majority of companies</em>\u00a0report that AI is just adding more chaos to a system already defined by chaos. In other words, most companies are bad at ops.</p>\n<p>To some extent, this is because the problems are hard. To a larger extent, I think it\u2019s the cause (and result) of our wholesale abandonment of operations as a term of pride.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s another a fucking feedback loop. Ambitious young engineers get the message that being associated with ops is bad, so they run away from those teams. Managers and execs want to recruit great talent and make jobs sound enticing, so they adopt trendy naming schemes to make it clear this work is\u00a0<em>not ops</em>.</p>\n<p>If you want to do something well, historically speaking, this is not the way. The way to build excellence is to name it for what it is, build communities of practice, raise the bar, and compensate for a job well done.</p>\n<p>Or as\u00a0<a href=\"https://charity.wtf/2016/05/31/wtf-is-operations-serverless/\" rel=\"\">one prognosticator</a>\u00a0said, way back in 2016:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think\u00a0<strong>it\u2019s time to bring back \u201coperations\u201d as a term of pride.</strong>\u00a0As a thing that is valued, and rewarded.</p>\n<p>\u201cOperations\u201d comes with baggage, no doubt. But I just don\u2019t think that distance and denial are an effective approach for making something better, let alone trash talking and devaluing the skill sets that you need to deliver quality services.</p>\n<p><strong>You don\u2019t make operational outcomes magically better by renaming the team \u201cDevOps\u201d or \u201cSRE\u201d or anything else.</strong>\u00a0You make it better by naming it and claiming it for what it is, and helping everyone understand how their role relates to your operational objectives.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Wow.

                "<p>Many, many years ago, at my childhood house in the Santa Cruz mountains, I grabbed a shovel and started to dig a hole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? Unclear. I was six or seven. I&#8217;d seen what my Dad could do with a shovel, so one afternoon\u2026. I started digging, and by the time evening approached, my Dad walked out, &#8220;So, wha&#8217;cha doing there?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of the hole intervention, I&#8217;d been at my hole digging for a couple of hours, and while that sounds like a lot of time, I was only two or three feet deep in a hole maybe the size of a picnic table. The removed dirt was tossed carelessly in every direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m digging a hole.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I see that. Wha&#8217;cha planning on doing with that hole?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No real answer at the ready. Like <a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-stick-in-the-stream/\">pulling a stick from a stream</a>, I was mostly enthralled with the act of digging a hole. I dodged his question, &#8220;Yeah, I think I&#8217;m going to need some wooden columns here at some point. Ya&#8217;know, to hold the ceiling up when I get that far.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dad, &#8220;Uh huh.&#8221; The hole was three or four feet deep \u2014 barely above my knees. And it was getting dark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I continued, &#8220;And I am worried about moisture\u2026. ya&#8217;know? Dripping from the ceiling.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dad, &#8220;Yeah. I get that.&#8221; <strong>Barely</strong> to my seven-year old knees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The digging continued for another hour. I&#8217;d discovered blisters (no gloves) and also dirt was now  falling back into the hole with each shovel-full (no solid dirt extraction plan), but my Dad stood there the entire time. Question continued:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dad: &#8220;Maybe we should get you a wheelbarrow? You could move the dirt into the ravine.&#8221; I ignored him and kept digging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me: &#8220;Dad, do we have a wooden chest? Where could we keep my stuff in the cave? Like a treasure chest?&#8221; Dad, &#8220;I&#8217;m sure we could figure that out.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You think you know how this story ends, and you&#8217;re mostly correct. We covered my picnic-table-sized shallow hole with a piece of plywood to &#8220;make sure no one falls in.&#8221; My plan was to finish digging the following day, but I have no memory of that picnic-table-sized hole after that night. I&#8217;m sure I visited it the next day, but the interest had vanished.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t remember this story because of the picnic-table-sized shallow hole; I remember this story because of my Dad. He walked out of the house and found his young son digging a random hole on the property. No plan, poorly equipped, but enthusiastically digging. He stood there asking questions, not judging. Supporting the dream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just letting me gleefully dig.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He taught me that no one knows where inspiration comes from \u2014 only that it&#8217;s fragile, invaluable, and fleeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>"

                "<p>My birthday\u2019s coming up, Jan 20th. Fifty-seven. As my Uncle Harold used to say in the 1980s, \u201cHey it\u2019s my birthday. Keep it under fifty bucks.\u201d I\u2019m not sure what I thought I\u2019d be doing right now, 30 years ago. But I wouldn\u2019t have guessed being in the best physical shape of my life, cranking out thousands of lines of production code per day, chatting all day with brilliant friends all around the world, and generally having an absolute blast. Life has a lot of ups and downs, so it\u2019s good to have an up year once in a\u00a0while.</p><p>2026 is shaping up to be straight-up insane. There\u2019s a lot going on, and it\u2019s speeding up. Here\u2019s a sketch of how my week has been. I\u2019ll talk about five themes: Money, Time, Power, Control, and Direction.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gdwF568ZEAFp6QHdgfLShQ.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Figure 1: A Busy\u00a0Week</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Part 1:\u00a0Money</strong></h3><p>There is a lot of money in AI, deserved or no. And even more money is sniffing around trying to get <em>in</em> to AI. The world\u2019s money is like a conscious thing, and it exerts pressure as it sloshes around. Money has a good nose, and it smells big changes in the air this year. First and foremost, it smells changes for software devs. But that\u2019s just a precursor to all knowledge workers being changed somehow by AI. Soon. Money knows this. Money wants the fuck\u00a0<em>in</em>.</p><p>It is now poking its head around every corner, through every nook in the AI spaces. Money got a pretty good whiff of my <a href=\"https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04\">Gas Town</a> fart, and now I\u2019m being stalked as prey by money from all sides. I don\u2019t have much money, having pissed all my AMZN and GOOG stock away on stuff I have zero regrets about, living life. And I wasn\u2019t raised with money, so I know fuck-all about how it\u00a0works.</p><p>But I know it\u2019s trying to get me. And for now, I\u2019ve gotta push\u00a0back.</p><p>My deepest apologies to the fifteen or sixteen VCs who have reached out so far, at a rate of roughly one per day since launch.<strong> </strong>I appreciate you. I\u2019ve given it a lot of thought. But I\u2019m not likely to go that route. I\u2019m sure there are nice $200B businesses to be built on both Beads and on Gas Town, but I\u2019m aiming bigger. They both build directly toward the third movie in my software orchestration trilogy, and I need to be relentlessly focused on that, not chasing ARR. I totally get that there are amazing people out there who would give me plenty of runway, but what I\u2019m building toward isn\u2019t financially defensible. It\u2019s not a moat. It\u2019s a life\u00a0raft.</p><p>And now I\u2019ll turn very briefly to another sloshing money monster that came after me last week. To catch you up if you\u2019re behind, and I <a href=\"https://medium.com/@steve-yegge/bags-and-the-creator-economy-249b924a621a\">posted about it in detail</a> a few days ago, someone created a meme coin about Gas Town and within a week I had made $300k USD in cryptocurrency transaction fees on that coin, which traded something like 16 million dollars in volume. Very weird turn of events. But it means I must be super\u00a0clear:</p><p><strong><em>Disclosure:</em></strong><em> I receive creator royalties/trading fees associated with $GAS trading on BAGS, and I may benefit financially from that activity. I didn\u2019t create $GAS and have no control over its price, supply, or liquidity. $GAS is </em><strong><em>not</em></strong><em> equity and does not give you any ownership interest in Gas Town or my work. This post is not financial advice\u200a\u2014\u200aCrypto assets are highly volatile and speculative. Do not trade based on this\u00a0content.</em></p><p>And with that disclaimer out of the way, I must reiterate my sincere regrets to the CT/BAGS crowd, who so generously funded me to the tune of just shy of $300k last week on <a href=\"https://bags.fm/\">bags.fm</a>. That money was hard to duck, and the funds are deeply appreciated. They will help Gas Town be a big success this year. But Gas Town itself needs my full attention; between that and Beads it\u2019s a wonder I get anything done at\u00a0all.</p><p>So I had to step back from the community. I do find it amazing how they band together, dissenting voices rolling around like a big Katamari Damacy ball, and yet they somehow collectively find the discipline to act like financial analysts for institutional investors, weighing developer dossiers, product business cases, and doing critiques like a collective of professionals. All in crypto-bro speak. But it\u2019s the same due diligence.</p><p>But the CT community, like any highly engaged stakeholders, were going to be asking for a lot of my time. There are always strings attached.</p><p>In short, I\u2019m avoiding tying myself to any money that makes demands on my time or direction. I\u2019ve got too much to do, to be worrying about monetizing right\u00a0now.</p><h3><strong>Part 2:\u00a0Time</strong></h3><p>I had lunch again (Kirkland Cactus) with my buddies Ajit Banerjee and Ryan Snodgrass, the ones who have been chastising teammates for acting on ancient 2-hour-old information. Every week we discuss some surprising new phenomenon or principle we\u2019ve discovered while coding with 20+\u00a0agents.</p><p>This week the surprise phenomenon was nappy time. Yeah, I don\u2019t use the word \u201csurprising\u201d lightly. High-end vibe coding is fucking with our sleep cycles. All though December I had weird sleeping patterns while I was building Gas Town. I\u2019d work late at night, and then have to take deep naps in the middle of the day. I\u2019d just be working along and boom, I\u2019d drop. I have a pillow and blanket on the floor next to my workstation. I\u2019ll just dive in and be knocked out for 90 minutes, once or often twice a\u00a0day.</p><p>At lunch, they surprised me by telling me that vibe coding at scale has messed up their sleep. They get blasted by the nap-strike almost daily, and are looking into installing nap pods in their shared workspace.</p><p>Before they mentioned it, I had chalked it up to jet lag. I get hit hard flying back West, and it can take me a couple weeks to get on my feet. But it has been 5 weeks since Sydney and it never stopped. I got clocked by a nap-strike on Friday. Your buffer just fills up and you\u2019re gone. I\u2019ve fallen asleep slower at the anesthesiologist. You wake up with a drool-soaked pillow wondering who you are, and five minutes later you\u2019re going hard with the agents\u00a0again.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t happening last year. It wasn\u2019t until we\u2019d started working with a dozen or more agents at once and doing swarming of large piles of\u00a0work.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GxI7LWAadOFxmZyHDExk0w.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Figure 2: Bezos Mode: Reviewing reports all\u00a0day</figcaption></figure><p>Our hypothesis is that we\u2019re operating at such a high level of decision-making that we\u2019re exhausting some internal buffers, and need to grab some gradient-descent time before we can continue.</p><p>To me it feels like Jeff Bezos Mode. I used to work for the man, and he basically spent his day listening carefully to presentations that smart people had prepared for him. They were never presenting easy shit. You only presented hard problems to Bezos. He had to absorb new information incredibly fast all day long, come up to speed on the spot, and make decisions that didn\u2019t conflict with each other. I call that Jeff Bezos Mode, and it\u2019s why he was always 18 steps ahead of all of the rest of us. He was solving curated puzzles all day, and it gave him otherworldly perspective.</p><p>It must have been utterly exhausting. Even for\u00a0him.</p><p>Well, all three of us spent years at Amazon, and we agree, this feels like Bezos Mode. With Opus 4.5 swarms, you flit from agent to agent, only stopping at the ones that have finished their work and have produced a report for you. These are the reports from agents that you gave hard problems to; e.g., your Gas Town Crew. Ephemeral agents like polecats can handle all the easy stuff without you needing to look, by definition. Which means that everything that you actually wind up reading from agents tends to be architecturally rich, complex, and\u00a0nuanced.</p><p>And we\u2019re finding it to be exhausting.</p><p>We\u2019re all pretty old, though, so YMMV. I don\u2019t remember Bezos running off to take naps. Maybe this phenomenon only hits senior citizens. But the much younger Geoffrey Huntley, who was kind enough to pre-review this blog post, shared that it was happening to him all last year, and continues to this day. \u201cEvery discovery blasts me. Wipes me out and takes a while to recover.\u201d So maybe we\u2019re on to something here.</p><p>I\u2019m going to go lay down and, uh, think about the problem with my eyes\u00a0closed.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WofgvCliHun-BmYFwbbM_Q.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Figure 3: Nap\u00a0Strike</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Part 3:\u00a0Power</strong></h3><p>I caught up today with Jeffrey Emanuel, who just launched a <a href=\"https://x.com/doodlestein/status/2012972038332260744?s=20\">Rust port of Beads</a> (pre-Gas Town API). He confirmed what I\u2019ve been seeing myself and hearing from others, which is that things are starting to accelerate insanely at the bleeding edges of software development.</p><p>Jeffrey, as we saw from his X posts, has bought so many Claude Pro Max $200/month plans (22 so far, or $4400/month in tokens) that he got auto-banned by Anthropic\u2019s fraud detection. He has become inhumanly productive. Among other things, he has recently ported a large number of popular libraries to Rust. All the Charm TUI libraries, fastapi, fastmcp, sqlmodel, a bunch of other stuff. Huge, polished libraries, completely cloned. And we\u2019re just seeing Jeffrey\u2019s exhaust, the projects he spins off as he works towards his bigger ambitions, which he\u2019s sketched for\u00a0me.</p><p>I\u2019d just like to remind everyone that I predicted this pay-to-play productivity boost, betting a lot of my own rep on it, in <a href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/blog/revenge-of-the-junior-developer\">Revenge of the Junior Developer</a>, ten months ago. I knew that the tools would support running 100+ Claude Code instances, and that the high-end spend would rival an engineer\u2019s salary within a year. Those predictions have come\u00a0true.</p><p>I\u2019m sure there aren\u2019t many people quite as far along as Jeffrey; on my 8-level chart he\u2019s a level 10. But they do exist, and their ranks are growing. There are on-ramps for the less crazy users. Gas Town, Claude Flow, and Loom are all gentle introductions to working with dozens of concurrent agents. They let you grow into the idea gradually, and it scales up with you as you practice. Everyone is going to learn how this stuff works this year, or die not trying. The industry won\u2019t be kind to the people who sleep on\u00a0this.</p><p>When you reach Level 8, building your own orchestrators, Gas Town may not be enough for you. You may want to try Gas City, my upcoming orchestration-builder toolkit, which I\u2019ll talk about\u00a0below.</p><p>Software engineering has always been incredibly high-leverage relative to other craft professions. Paul Graham used to write about this back in the late 1990s and early 00s. You could always find programmers who are 10x or 100x better than the average programmer, and you don\u2019t see such a broad distribution in most other professions.</p><p>With agentic coding, it\u2019s about to go to 1000x or even 10000x. I\u2019m far from the only one noticing or talking about this. The more agents you can run successfully, the further you climb up the exponential curve, because it\u2019s recursive: agents can run agents who run agents. The trick will be to manage that without becoming the Flying Wallendas. It will\u00a0happen.</p><p>2026 will be a year where you see single engineers cloning, say, the entire Java/JVM stack and core ecosystem by themselves. Or a team of 2\u20135 engineers being able to recreate the an entire enterprise stack for a big company, in any language they want, factored into maintainable microservices. If you can afford the tokens, and you can <em>find</em> the tokens, you will be able to build things like you never imagined. You just have to learn how to tame the\u00a0camels.</p><p>As I predicted in RotJD, you tame them with orchestrators: the new\u00a0IDEs.</p><h3><strong>Part 4:\u00a0Control</strong></h3><p>Agent orchestrators are programs that use agents to run other\u00a0agents.</p><p>There are, as far as I can tell, four main players in this space: <a href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum\">Ralph Wiggum</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/ghuntley/loom\">Loom</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow\">Claude Flow</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown\">Gas Town</a>. More will come <em>very</em> soon, from all corners. But I thought I\u2019d share my thoughts on how to tell the current group apart, as they are all very important.</p><p>This is just a snapshot of my current thinking. I haven\u2019t used any of the other orchestrators, and as far as I know, none of us have used each other\u2019s work. We\u2019re all very busy. This is a best-effort first\u00a0take.</p><p>First off, I\u2019d like to reiterate my deepest respect to the creators of these orchestrators. They\u2019re the level 9s, the ones who have already built multiple working orchestrators in order to get this far. They\u2019re the ones who had the guts to launch when all everyone else could do is say \u201cI\u2019m working on one.\u201d Thanks to <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/e26a0a46e594\">Dan Shapiro</a> for that insight, and I heartily agree, since it took a lot of guts to launch Gas\u00a0Town.</p><p>Here\u2019s how I\u2019m thinking about them right now. They\u2019re all changing fast so this is a snapshot.</p><p>I think Geoffrey Huntley and I have been exploring two of the key components of the Industrial Revolution happening in agentic software development: factories, and workers. In my view, Claude Code is a worker. Geoffrey has built a super-worker, and also a team of super workers with <a href=\"https://youtu.be/zX_Wq9wAyxI?si=aLGKmzKlGrTQxgDx\">Loom</a>, whereas I\u2019ve built a super-factory. These are all orthogonal, complementary, and necessary.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1wiTWL2IdFrQ-dRLaSMBlw.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Figure 4: Coding Agent Industrial Revolution</figcaption></figure><p>Claude Flow is a bit different; it also tries to be a factory, and it\u2019s quite clever, but it\u2019s not thinking about the problem the way I am. All three of the others have orchestration as their core primitive. Whereas for Gas Town, the work itself is the primitive. Gas Town federates work into an auditable ledger for tracking millions of work items in a blockchain. I\u2019m solving a completely different problem. Gas Town\u2019s orchestration facilities are a thin layer atop a work-definition stack. And in time, Gas Town will be rewritten in that stack, in a much more flexible way, allowing for all sorts of orchestration shapes.</p><p>Geoffrey Huntley and I have been chatting and plotting together lately, with more collaboration to come. One amusing thing we discovered is that we were each tackling the other\u2019s problem last year. I was working on a super-agent (basically, quality) and he was working on swarming (quantity). We each built multiple complete implementations. And toward the end of the year, we each flipped to the opposite\u00a0problem.</p><p>In my view, Geoffrey\u2019s Ralph loops are a brilliant automation of the discovery that LLMs can self-review to convergence, which I believe Jeffrey Emanuel was also onto with his (weaker, manual) Rule of Five. I also have a weak version of this idea in Gas Town; I can show you exactly where. It\u2019s the top row of Figure 12 in <a href=\"https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04\">Welcome to Gas Town</a>, \u201cGas Town\u2019s Patrols,\u201d where there is a row of workflows that are not patrols. These are vestigial remnants of my first two orchestrators, which focused on trying to get Claude to act like a thorough engineer when it has finally been assigned a task by the\u00a0factory.</p><p>These weren\u2019t fully productionized; the polecats can use them but never do, and the right thing to do is rip them out and replace them with Ralph loops. Gas Town shouldn\u2019t be trying to solve the quality problem, since Ralph has done a much better\u00a0job.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NLSSmqgf-vqGePyVstB6og.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Figure 5: Gas Town\u2019s Hidden Shitty Ralph\u00a0Clone</figcaption></figure><p>Similarly, Gas Town has very loose coordination primitives for groups of workers tackling a task\u200a\u2014\u200ae.g. polecats are often parts of larger convoys. I\u2019ve no doubt whatsoever that in these situations, something like either Loom or Claude Flow is going to be the right solution to plug in. That\u2019s not Gas Town\u2019s focus; I had almost none of it at\u00a0launch.</p><p>Gas Town\u2019s focus is the work, the stuff you know needs to be done, independent of superintelligence. I\u2019m a big believer in the MEOW stack, Nondeterministic Idempotence, and Beads as a Universal Data Plane. These are all critically important differentiators for Gas Town, and they will yield unexpected emergent benefits over time because of the audit\u00a0trail.</p><p>Orchestrators will shift and change shape rapidly over the next few months. Everyone\u2019s going to start building them. But I think Gas Town\u2019s core infrastructure has a credible advantage over anyone who\u2019s not thinking about the data trail properly.</p><p>I contend that Beads was like the discovery of oil. Right now everyone is playing with it and lighting lanterns, not realizing it\u2019s going to turn into the global petroleum industry for data. Gas Town makes work (Beads) shoot out in geysers. It\u2019s an actual boom town built on the oil of a digital data plane in git. Think where it will\u00a0go.</p><p>I don\u2019t think Gas Town is like any other orchestrator out there. Not remotely close. The only thing that\u2019s probably not quite right with it yet, is the shape. Kubernetes-shaped is just one way to make an orchestrator, and there are a million other\u00a0ways.</p><p>Let\u2019s talk about how Gas Town will find exactly the right shape for\u00a0you.</p><h3><strong>Part 5: Direction</strong></h3><p>Last topic. What a week,\u00a0amirite?</p><p>I\u2019ve mentioned that Dario Amodei refers to 2026 as \u201cThe Endgame.\u201d Well, we\u2019re\u00a0here.</p><p>Gas Town has a deep stack, but its current form factor is just a sketch. All the roles are completely hardwired in the Go code. Gas Town has Go modules dedicated to the Witness, Refinery, Mayor, Deacon, Polecats, etc. So it\u2019s part of the architecture, and hard to change at this\u00a0point.</p><p>But halfway through the implementation, I realized the MEOW stack had become powerful enough to abstract away the roles themselves, allowing you to express them in a sort of DSL based on Beads, with just a little orchestration glue.</p><p>I chatted with Claude, and we decided to finish Gas Town and then turn around and immediately begin work on the SDK-builder that lets you build your own Gas Town, with your own roles, teams, coordination rules, and worker instructions. This will allow people to create, for instance, roles and patrols that handle custom business processes.</p><p>So Gas Town will soon evolve into a kit that lets you build your own town shapes. (And wire in your own sandboxes, plugins, hooks, etc. etc.) Where does Ralph fit\u00a0in?</p><p>Ralph loops are effectively tasks. A Ralph loop is fundamentally concerned with <em>finishing a task </em>at a high level of quality. A Gas Town patrol is fundamentally concerned with <em>recording task execution</em> for a well-defined sequence of steps, often done in a loop. For instance, ETLs are an old-fashioned kind of patrol, where every time a database changes, someone notices and exports the data with some transformation steps. Businesses are all built on patrols, but we don\u2019t call them that because they have not historically had humanlike intelligence. Starting in 2026, they\u00a0will.</p><p>A patrol step is a task. So I feel the ideal patrol will turn out to be one that invokes a Ralph loop at each step, at least for steps that require complex processing. A good patrol agent will know when it\u2019s needed, and use Ralph loops judiciously, even watching them to make sure they don\u2019t go off-rails.</p><p>In addition to making patrols more reliable, I think another huge Ralph win for Gas Town will be for the polecats, which are ephemeral Claude Code instances that handle feature work, bug fixes, code reviews, and other one-shot tasks. Work is slung to polecats in the context of a Convoy for tracking, and polecats have persistent Git identities, so there\u2019s a factory dance to it\u00a0all.</p><p>Great. But, once a polecat finally spins up and takes its task, it has proven about as trustworthy as a real\u00a0polecat.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AFpNBmKUvz8bXbYcmTsZIA.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Figure 6: Four ways Gas Town polecats can\u00a0work</figcaption></figure><p>The picture above shows four different possible polecat work styles. The one we have in play today is the lower-right quadrant, which accurately depicts one sleeping, one daydreaming about playing trombone (this may be the first genuinely funny joke I\u2019ve seen from nano banana), and various others in states of disarray.</p><p>That is how Gas Town feels right now. The polecats are unsupervised, uncoordinated, and left on their own to get to the finish line. You spend a lot of time asking the Mayor to poke them to finish up. This is a quality problem, and Ralph will solve it brilliantly. And for more complex tasks, Loom or Claude Flow could push it even further, tackling ever-larger problems.</p><p>Real-world use case: Gas Town often has a problem with giving tasks that are too large to polecats, and they can choke trying to swallow their food. They\u2019ll run out of context and compact (a failure scenario IMO), or do a bad job, or balk. They do have the ability to escalate and kick it back to the human if the task needs splitting. But why bother with that, when you could just have a Ralph loop brute-force it? Ralph\u2019s super-workers will turn Gas Town into a super-factory.</p><p>Gas City is what I\u2019m calling my next iteration, where you can define your own custom roles in addition to patrols etc. I\u2019ve got some stuff in the queue to finish up first, such as switching Beads to use the amazing Dolt database, which I\u2019ll post about soon. But Ralph\u2019s on the docket. And I keep adding Claude Pro Max subscriptions, so I may get to it sooner than\u00a0later.</p><p>In the meantime, I\u2019m still working on Gas Town stability, merging community PRs, and making the core Gas Town work better and better for people brave enough to try it out. Gas Town itself still has a long way to go in order to be ready for mass-market adoption. A <em>loooong </em>way. But we\u2019ll get\u00a0there.</p><p>And it\u2019s a wrap! What a\u00a0week.</p><p>Biggest takeaway: If you haven\u2019t tried Beads yet, now\u2019s the time. Gas Town is a big experiment, but Beads is mature and already getting replicated in other language ecosystems.</p><p>See you all online!

Nothing actually changed.</p>\n<div>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-25037\"></span>\n\n\n</div>\n<p>We already knew that vaccines don\u2019t cause autism, and that Tylenol doesn\u2019t cause autism, but now we know such things on an entirely different level.</p>\n<p>I admit that this result confirms all of my priors and thus I might be insufficiently skeptical of it, but there are a lot of people with what we in 2026 call autism that are out there, they love picking apart such findings, and I\u2019ve seen zero of them question the statistical result.</p>\n<p>Autism used to mean something severe enough to render a child non-functional.</p>\n<p>It now means someone capable of thinking clearly who insists words have meaning.</p>\n<p>It also still means the first thing, and everything in between.</p>\n<p>Using the same word for all these things, and calling it the autism spectrum, does not, overall, do those on either end of that spectrum any favors.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/2006396788484284757\">Matthew Yglesias</a>: \u200bStudy confirms that neither Tylenol nor vaccines is responsible for the rise in autism <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-dangerous-war-on-tylenol\">BECAUSE THERE IS NO RISE IN AUTISM TO EXPLAIN</a> just a change in diagnostic standards.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://pages.uoregon.edu/eherman/teaching/texts/DSM-I%20-%20DSM-IV%20diagnostic%20criteria.pdf\">D.S.M.-III</a> called for a diagnosis of infantile autism if all six of these criteria were met:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Onset before 30 months of age</li>\n<li>Pervasive lack of responsiveness to other people</li>\n<li>Gross deficits in language development</li>\n<li>Peculiar speech patterns (if speech is present) such as immediate and delayed echolalia, metaphorical language, or pronominal reversal</li>\n<li>Bizarre responses to various aspects of the environment, e.g., resistance to change, peculiar interest in or attachments to animate or inanimate objects</li>\n<li>Absence of delusions, hallucinations, loosening of associations, and incoherence, as in schizophrenia</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is clearly describing a uniformly debilitating condition, especially in terms of criteria (3) and (4).</p></blockquote>\n<p>That is very, very obviously not what anyone centrally means by \u2018autism\u2019 in 2025, and we are going searching for it under every corner.</p>\n<blockquote><p>By the time the D.S.M.-IV came out in 1994, things like \u201clack of social or emotional reciprocity\u201d when combined with \u201clack of varied spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level\u201d could qualify a child for an autism diagnosis, as long as they also have trouble making eye contact.\u200b</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/2006449616359981280\">Cremieux</a>: <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/an-autism-challenge\">The result is consistent with 98.25% of the rise being due to diagnostic drift</a> and that\u2019s not significantly different from 100%.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/bryan_caplan/status/2006545490234716242\">Bryan Caplan</a>: Occam\u2019s Razor.

Obviously yes.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Derek Thompson: I think the answer to this question is clearly yes.</p>\n<p>The expansion of the autism diagnosis in the last few decades has created a mess of meaning. It\u2019s not helpful that \u201cautism spectrum\u201d now contains such an enormous bucket of symptoms that it applies to non-verbal adults requiring round-the-clock care and &#8230; Elon Musk.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The expansion of the autism spectrum label is especially poor for those at either extreme. It destroys clarity. It causes large underreactions in severe cases. It causes large overreactions in mild cases, including treating such children in well-intended but highly unproductive ways.</p>\n<p>It also is, as Michael Vassar points out, effectively part of a war against caring about truth and whether words have meaning, as anyone who does so care is now labeled as having a disorder. To be \u2018normal\u2019 rather than \u2018neurodivergent\u2019 you have to essentially show you care deeply about and handle social dynamics and trivialities without having to work at this, and that you don\u2019t care about accuracy, whether words have meaning or whether maps match their territories.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Exercise Is Awesome</h4>\n\n\n<p>Seriously, one cannot write \u2018most people need to exercise more\u2019 often enough.</p>\n<p>I heard a discussion on NPR\u2019s Wait Wait Don\u2019t Tell Me where a study uncovered that as little as half an hour a week of light exercise can do a substantial amount of good. The response from everyone was to joke that this means they didn\u2019t need to do any more than that and doing anything at all made them heroes. And yes, there\u2019s big gains for \u2018do anything at all\u2019 rather than nothing, but there\u2019s quite a lot left to gain.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/738251\">University students given free gym memberships</a> exercised more and has a significant improvement in academic performance, dropping out of classes less and failing exams less, completing 0.15 SDs more courses. There\u2019s a perversity to hearing \u2018this made kids healthy, which is good because they got higher grades\u2019 but if that\u2019s what it takes, okay, sure. The cost-benefit here purely in increased earnings seems good enough.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A large majority of students do not report having financial or time constraints at baseline, which suggests that the free gym card primarily removed psychological barriers to exercise. This is in line with the fact that many participants reported at baseline that they did not exercise at the gym because they were lazy, which may be interpreted as a sign of procrastination.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This all came from an average of 5.7 additional gym visits per student, which isn\u2019t that great a return on a gym membership at first glance. For the effect to be this big there have to be shifts beyond the exercise, something psychological or at least logistical.</p>\n<p>There still are very clear diminishing marginal returns.</p>\n<p>Thus here is your <a href=\"https://x.com/oscredwin/status/1987899138961236092\">periodic fitness reminder that although exercising and being in shape is great</a> but there are rapidly decreasing practical returns once you become an outlier in strength, and going deep into gym culture and \u2018looking jacked\u2019 has actively negative marginal returns, including in terms of attractiveness and also the injury risk rises a lot.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">That\u2019s Peanuts</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/robinhanson/status/2007877218400124987\">Exposure to potential allergens as infants</a> decreases allergies, with peanuts being the central example. Carefully avoiding them, as we were for a while told by doctors to do, is exactly wrong. It\u2019s so crazy that our \u2018experts\u2019 could get this so exactly backwards for so long, luckily such allergies are on the decline again now that we realize. But as Robin Hanson says, who is there to sue over this epic failure?</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">An Age Of Wonders</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/GeneSmi96946389/status/2011621643068850440\">Gene Smith reports that some IVF doctors have figured out</a> how to get much more reliable embryo transfer than the traditional 70%, and also higher egg yields per round. A highly competent IVF practice and doctor can make a big difference, and for now its value could be bigger than those from finding superior embryo selection.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2025/10/23/vaccine-cancer-covid-19-mrna/?utm_campaign=wp_main&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\">Study finds mRNA Covid-19 vaccines prolonged life of cancer patients</a>, which they claim is via trained immunity from a Type I Interferon surge and activation of MDA5, but it seems they didn\u2019t do a great job controlling for the obvious factor of whether this came from its protective effects against Covid-19? That seems like a giant hole in the study, but they are in Phase III which will settle it either way. If the effect is real you can likely enhance it quite a lot with a combination of mRNA composition and timing the shot to the start of using checkpoint inhibitors.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">GLP-1s In Particular</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/health/eli-lilly-retatrutide-weight-loss-drug.html\">The latest experimental GLP-1 entry from Eli Lilly</a>, is showing the largest weight loss results we\u2019ve seen so far, including big impacts on arthritis and knee pain.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/rcna235471\">Costco to sell Ozempic and Wegovy at large discount for people without insurance</a>, at $499 a month, the same as Novo Nordisk\u2019s direct-to-consumer website. You do still need a prescription.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1968096846548812105\">Eli Lilly seems to have made a once-daily weight loss pill</a> that works 80%-90% as well as injected Ozempic, with fewer side effects. It\u2019s plausible this would make adaptation much more common, and definitely would if combined with affordable prices and easy access.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w34678\">Unfortunately an early study suggests that GLP-1s do not</a>, so far, reduce medical spending, with little offset in other spending being observed or projected. Given this is a highly effective treatment that reduces diabetes and cardiovascular risks, that is a weird result, and suggests something is broken in the medical system.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Superheroes</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/11/incentives-matter-and-supply-is-elastic.html\">Elasticity of the supply</a> of pharmaceutical development of new drugs is high.

We should absolutely be willing to grant more profitability or outright payments for such progress.</p>\n<p>Australia offers a strong pitch as a location for clinical trials, <a href=\"https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/for-clinical-trial-reform-we-need\">and as a blueprint for reform here in America</a> if we want to do something modest.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/shelbynewsad/status/1968361454358380806\">Dr. Shelby</a>: when people talk about Australia for clinical trials, most discourse is round the 40%+ rebates.</p>\n<p>BUT, what I haven\u2019t heard discussed is that they don\u2019t require IND packages in some cases. (eg. new insulin format, or new EPO analogues for anemia).</p>\n<p>drugs going through this path only need CMC and and ethics approval.</p>\n<p>Ruxandra Teslo: Also no full GMP for Phase I. Imo US should just literally copy the Phase I playbook from Australia.</p>\n<p>One of the most frustrating experiences in trying to propose ideas on how to make clinical development faster/cheaper, is that ppl who have on-the-ground experience are reluctant to share it, for fear of retribution. The cancel culture nobody talks about.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Supervillains</h4>\n\n\n<p>Your periodic reminder that today\u2019s shortage of doctors <a href=\"https://x.com/Matthew_Meyers5/status/1974148023384170769\">is a policy choice intentionally engineered by the American Medical Association</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/for-clinical-trial-reform-we-need\">Ruxandra Teslo offers another round</a> of pointing out that if we had less barriers to testing potential new treatments we\u2019d get a lot more treatments, but that no one in the industry has the courage to talk about how bad things are or suggest fixes because you would get accused of the associated downside risks, even though the benefits outweigh the risks by orders of magnitude. Ruxandra notes that we have a desperate shortage of \u2018Hobbit courage,\u2019 or the type of intellectual courage where you speak up even though you yourself have little to gain. This is true in many contexts of course.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Patrick McKenzie (about Ruxandra\u2019s article): A good argument about non-political professional courage, which is *also* an argument why those of us who have even moderate influence or position can give early career professionals an immense boost at almost trivial cost, by advancing them a tiny portion of their future self.</p>\n<p>This is one reason this sometimes Internet weirdo keeps his inbox open to anyone and why he routinely speaks to Internet weirdos. I\u2019m not too useful on biotech but know a thing or two about things.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the only endorsement someone needs is \u201cI read their stuff and they don\u2019t seem to be an axe murderer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sarah Constantin: The most awful stories I heard about \u201che said this and never got a grant again\u201d were criticisms of the scientific establishment, of funders, or regulators.</p>\n<p>Tame stuff like \u201cthere\u2019s too much bureaucracy\u201d or \u201cscience should be non-commercial.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>In terms of talking to internet weirdos who reach out, I can\u2019t always engage, especially not at length, but I try to help when I can.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t see enough consideration of \u2018goal factoring\u2019 around the testing process and the FDA. As in, doing tests has two distinct purposes, that are less linked than you\u2019d hope.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Finding out if and in what ways the drug is safe and effective, or not.</li>\n<li>Providing the legal evidence to continue testing, and ultimately to sell your drug.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you outright knew the answer to #1, that would cut your effective costs for #2 dramatically, because now you only have to test one drug to find one success, whereas right now most drugs we test fail. So the underrated thing to do, even though it is a bit slower, is to do #1 first. As in, you gather strong Bayesian evidence on whether your drug works, however necessary and likely with a lot of AI help, then only after you know this do you go through formal channels and tests in America. I will keep periodically pointing this out in the hopes people listen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/11/why-are-us-clinical-trials-so-expensive.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=why-are-us-clinical-trials-so-expensive\">Why do clinical trials in America</a> <a href=\"https://cheekypint.transistor.fm/\">cost a median of $40,000 per enrollee?</a> Alex Tabarrok points us to an interview with Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks. There are a lot of factors making the situation quite bad.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Alex Tabarrok: One point is obvious once you hear it: Sponsors must provide high-end care to trial participants\u2013thus because U.S. health care is expensive, US clinical trials are expensive. Clinical trial costs are lower in other countries because health care costs are lower in other countries but a surprising consequence is that it\u2019s also easier to recruit patients in other countries because sponsors can offer them care that\u2019s clearly better than what they normally receive. In the US, baseline care is already so good, at least at major hospital centers where you want to run clinical trials, that it\u2019s more difficult to recruit patients.</p>\n<p>Add in IRB friction and other recruitment problems, and U.S. trial costs climb fast.</p>\n<p>See also Chertman and Teslo at IFP who have a lot of <a href=\"https://ifp.org/the-case-for-clinical-trial-abundance/\">excellent material on clinical trial abundance</a>.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">FDA Delenda Est</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/seconds_0/status/1972479305361039810\">Once again, FDA Delenda Est</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Anatoly Karlin: Lilly stopped one of two trials of bimagrumab, a drug that preserves muscle mass during weight loss, after new FDA guidance suggested that body composition effects wouldn\u2019t be enough for approval, but would need to show incremental weight loss beyond the GLPs.</p></blockquote>\n<p>GLP-1s help you lose weight. The biggest downside is potential loss of muscle composition. But the FDA has decided that fixing this problem is not good enough, and they won\u2019t approve a new drug that is strictly better on an important metric than an existing drug. Not that they won\u2019t recommend it, that they won\u2019t approve it. As in, it\u2019s strictly better, but it\u2019s not enough strictly better in the ways they think count, so that\u2019s a banning.</p>\n<p>Which is all Obvious Nonsense and will make people\u2019s lives much worse, as some lose muscle mass, others put in a lot more stress and effort to not lose it, and others don\u2019t take the GLP-1 and thus lose the weight.</p>\n<p>The second best answer is that things like muscle loss prevention should count as superior endpoints.</p>\n<p>The first best answer is that \u2018superiority\u2019 is a deeply stupid requirement. If you have drug [A] that does [X], and then I have drug [B] that also does [X] about as well, the existence of [A] should not mean we ban [B]. That\u2019s crazy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/16/fda-chaos-hurts-innovation-two-examples-replimune-capricor/\">Uncertainty at the new iteration of the FDA</a> is endangering drug development on top of the FDA\u2019s usual job endangering drug development. You can\u2019t make the huge investments necessary if you are at risk of getting rejected on drugs that have already been approved elsewhere, for reasons you had no ability to anticipate.</p>\n<p>It would be good not to have an FDA, or even better to have a much less restrictive FDA. But if we\u2019re not going to relax the rules, incompetence only makes it all worse.</p>\n<p>Some good news: <a href=\"https://x.com/DrMakaryFDA/status/2010906917682757979\">The FDA is now \u2018open to Bayesian statistical approaches</a>.\u2019 I suspect this only means \u2018you can use evidence from Phase 2 in Phase 3\u2019 but it\u2019s great to see them admitting in the announcement that Bayesian is better than frequentist.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hansonian Medicine</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/robinhanson/status/2010828545946259832\">Robin Hanson finds</a> <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w34682\">the most Hansoninan Medical study</a>. Amy Finkelstein and Matthew Gentzkow use mover designs to estimate the causal impact of healthcare spending on mortality. They find that extra healthcare spending, on current margins, has slightly negative impact.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Robin Hanson: \u200b\u201dwe investigate whether places that increase health care spending also tend to be places that increase health. We find that they do not\u201d</p>\n<p>Their point estimate is that residents <em>lose</em> ~5 days of lifespan at age 65 for every 10% increase in medical spending. Standard error of this estimate is ~7 days.</p>\n<p>So two sigma (95% confidence level) above the estimate is +9 days of lifespan. Really hard to see that being worth 2% of GDP.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The discussion is frank that this doesn\u2019t rule out that different regions might be providing similar care with different levels of efficiency. In that case, there\u2019s a lot of money to be saved by improving efficiency, but it doesn\u2019t mean care is wasted. There\u2019s also potential selection effects on who moves. You would also want to consider other endpoints beyond mortality, but it\u2019s hard to see those improving much if mortality doesn\u2019t also improve.</p>\n<p>Robin Hanson links us <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w34249\">to this paper</a>, showing that greater expected pension benefits led to more preventative care, better diagnosis of chronic diseases and improved mortality outcomes. As in, there is a real incentive effect on health, at least at some income levels.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hospital Strategy 101</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/RealGeneKim/status/1975707331129450559\">Gene Kim offers a writeup of his wife\u2019s hospital experience</a>, explaining some basics of what you need to do to ensure your loved ones get the care they need. Essentially, the Emergency Department is very good at handling things you can handle in the Emergency Department, but the wiring connecting the various departments is often quite poor, so anything else is on you to ensure the coordination, and that information reaches those who need it, figure out where you\u2019re going and how to get there. The good news is that everyone wants it to work out, but no one else is going to step up. It\u2019s on you to ask the questions, share and gather the info and so on. What\u2019s missing here is don\u2019t be afraid to ask LLMs for help too.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mental Hospital Strategy 101</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.psychiatrymargins.com/p/a-groundbreaking-analysis-upends\">Being admitted to a mental hospital is very, very bad for you</a>. This is known. It severely disrupts and potentially ruins your life permanently. The two weeks after release from the hospital put you at very high risk of suicide. Having someone committed, even for a few days, is not something to be taken lightly.</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean one should never do it. In sufficiently dire circumstances, where outcomes are going to be terrible no matter what you do, it is still superior to known alternatives. The question is, how dire must be the circumstances to make this true? Are we doing it too often, or not often enough?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.psychiatrymargins.com/p/a-groundbreaking-analysis-upends\">A new study measures this</a> <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1158\">by looking at marginal admissions</a>, as different doctors act very differently in marginal cases, allowing us to conduct something remarkably close to an RCT. Such disagreement is very common, 43% of those evaluated for involuntary commitment for the first time fall into this group in the sample.</p>\n<p>Even with 7,150 hospitalization decisions, the study\u2019s power is still not what we would like (the results are statistically significant, but not by that much considered individually), but the damage measured is dramatic: The chance of a marginal admit being charged with a violent crime within three months increases from 3.3% to 5.9% if they get admitted, the risk of suicide or death by drug overdose rises from 1.1% to 2.1%.</p>\n<p>This matches the associated incentives. If you don\u2019t refer or admit someone at risk, and something goes wrong, you are now blameworthy, and you put yourself in legal jeopardy. If you do refer or admit them, then you wash your hands of the situation, and what happens next is not on you. Thus, you would expect marginal cases to be committed too often, which is what we find here.</p>\n<p>It seems reasonable to conclude that the bar for involuntary commitment should be much higher, and along the lines of \u2018only do this if there is no doubt and no choice.\u2019</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Drugs Are Bad, Mmmkay?</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/tenobrus/status/1964769667073102290\">Ketamine use is bad for you</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Lighter Side</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/IvanVendrov/status/1980836030396719451\">The best description I\u2019ve seen of how to think about \u2018biological age\u2019 measures</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ivan: i will only trust your health app\u2019s \u2018biological age\u2019 report if it comes bundled with a life insurance offer.</p></blockquote>"
