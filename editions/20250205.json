                "<h2 id=\"on-a-body-to-die-in\">On A Body To Die In</h2><img alt=\"Off the Wagon\" src=\"https://www.bramadams.dev/content/images/2025/02/Fortunio-Liceti-Image.jpeg\" /><p>Yesterday I posted this (<a href=\"https://bramses.micro.blog/2025/02/04/bad-shape-today-more-details.html?ref=bramadams.dev\">https://bramses.micro.blog/2025/02/04/bad-shape-today-more-details.html</a>) where I mentioned that my weight has actually gone up over the past week. I seem to have fallen a little bit off of the proverbial wagon. I put a lot of emotional stress on this launch party that I was building up to, and I think that the vacancy of that immediate stress just caused me to rebound into some pretty bad habits: binging junk food, not going to the gym, and sleeping a bunch. I think that at least the latter - the sleeping a bunch - made sense because I was genuinely exhausted. (I am still kind of recovering. I&apos;m writing this on Tuesday, so this was four days ago. It might take a week or two to rebound my stress levels to normal).</p><p>Today, I&apos;m thinking about how to get back on the bandwagon for the gym and start losing weight again to get to my final goal of 170-ish pounds. I think that the best place to get started is to kind of just start with calories and then make my way slowly back into the gym. I lost momentum, and it really kind of took the floor out from under me. This is a good lesson though, because in a lot of ways you need the bad days to show you the direction of where the good days could go.</p><hr /><h2 id=\"on-books\">On Books</h2><p>As for reading, I just finished the books &quot;Meditations for Mortals&quot; by Oliver Burkeman and &quot;The Life of Alexander the Great&quot; by Plutarch. &quot;The Life of Alexander the Great&quot; was pretty good. It was obviously written before chapters were invented, which reminded me that chapters are indeed a technology. It&apos;s written like a single long run-on sentence of the events of Alexander&apos;s life. There&apos;s a lot of Greek names that are very confusing and I had trouble following who was who, but overall I kind of got the general gist of what Plutarch thought about Alexander. </p><p>Alexander was obviously a renowned general and leader, but he was also embroiled in a world of myth. He was heavily superstitious and there was a lot of prayers and rituals around his life &#x2013;  and a lot of drinking too. There&apos;s a lot of these kind of demi-god type stories because that was the condition of being a ruler in his era. I think it&apos;s really interesting how humans have evolved away from comparing ourselves to gods in certain ways, but then have tried to create gods with our technology to fill the gap.</p><p>Overall, &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; I would give it four stars, a really good historical novel and I think worth reading. Especially because I&apos;ve been on a kick lately where I like reading books that were written before English was invented as a language. I think it helps connect me to the overall human condition.</p><p>The other book, &quot;Meditations for Mortals,&quot; on the other hand, unfortunately I have nothing good to say about. It was really bad. It felt like it should have been a blog post. I liked Oliver Burkeman&apos;s work, &quot;Four Thousand Weeks,&quot; &#x2013; that was really good because it was talking about how a human is, by default, a mortal creature and we keep taking on these immortal tasks. So it makes more sense, physiologically, to give up on trying to be perfect and instead just embrace imperfection. I think he carried some of the same ideology into this book, but it just didn&apos;t play out as well.</p><p>Some of the chapters were pretty interesting,  there was a few interesting ideas about like a &quot;done list&quot; which I liked, and there was another idea about &quot;operating from sanity&quot; where you do the thing you want for your future self today (aka don&apos;t wait); and there were a few other ideas that kind of stuck out to me as being useful. But overall this was just a not great, crappy self-help book. </p><p>The format itself was kind of interesting, it was short, and it was meant to be read over the course of 28 days. I think I read it over the course of 14 because I didn&apos;t want to actually sit here and read it for 28 days because I didn&apos;t like where it was going. I kind of basically gave up around day 25 or 26 mark because I was just like the boring, repetitive nature of the read.  &quot;Meditations for Mortals&quot; gets two stars.</p><hr /><p>I need to figure out a way for bramadams.dev to feed back upstream. It&apos;s important to me.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img alt=\"Off the Wagon\" class=\"kg-image\" height=\"732\" src=\"https://www.bramadams.dev/content/images/2025/02/image.png\" width=\"1000\" /></figure><p>One thing that jumps out immediately is using consistent posting to this website to feed back into the fear-greed-pain loop of not having posted and feeling guilt.</p><p> While that may be a good catalyst, it&apos;s not sustainable. I need to figure out a way to tire it into the curiosity-confidence-desire hunt loop. </p><p>I&apos;m not really sure about which strategy is best or which is most sustainable. As it stands, this website currently operates as a sink, while I operate as a source that requires energy and filters down to the sink through the layers. That&apos;s fine, but I need to be able to take that back into the source for this to be a sustainable process. Otherwise, I&apos;m trending towards zero.</p><p>Another pseudo-obvious route is to use the website as an accountability partner of sorts to keep myself motivated to continue to lose weight and read books by either attaching some kind of financial incentive or by attaching some kind of implicit incentive where I can mark off this being a successful day or something like that in my head. </p><p>But that&apos;s more of a persuasion-justification loop than it is actually practical or rational.</p>"

I seem to have fallen a little bit off of the proverbial wagon. I put a lot of emotional stress on this launch party that I was building up to, and I think that the vacancy of that immediate stress just caused me to rebound into some pretty bad habits: binging junk food, not going to the gym, and sleeping a bunch. I think that at least the latter - the sleeping a bunch - made sense because I was genuinely exhausted. (I am still kind of recovering. I&apos;m writing this on Tuesday, so this was four days ago. It might take a week or two to rebound my stress levels to normal).</p><p>Today, I&apos;m thinking about how to get back on the bandwagon for the gym and start losing weight again to get to my final goal of 170-ish pounds. I think that the best place to get started is to kind of just start with calories and then make my way slowly back into the gym. I lost",

                "<div class=\"trix-content\">\n  <div>The first time we had to evacuate Malibu this season was during the Franklin fire in early December. We went to bed with our bags packed, thinking they'd probably get it under control. But by 2am, the roaring blades of fire choppers shaking the house got us up. As we sped down the canyon towards Pacific Coast Highway (PCH), the fire had reached the ridge across from ours, and flames were blazing large out the car windows. It felt like we had left the evacuation a little too late, but they eventually did get Franklin under control before it reached us.<br /><br /></div><div>Humans have a strange relationship with risk and disasters. We're so prone to wishful thinking and bad pattern matching. I remember people being shocked when the flames jumped the PCH during the Woolsey fire in 2017. IT HAD NEVER DONE THAT! So several friends of ours had to suddenly escape a nightmare scenario, driving through burning streets, in heavy smoke, with literally their lives on the line. Because the past had failed to predict the future.</div><div><br />I fell into that same trap for a moment with the dramatic proclamations of wind and fire weather in the days leading up to January 7. Warning after warning of &quot;extremely dangerous, life-threatening wind&quot; coming from the City of Malibu, and that overly-bureaucratic-but-still-ominous &quot;Particularly Dangerous Situation&quot; designation. Because, really, how much worse could it be? Turns out, a lot.<br /><br /></div><div>It was a little before noon on the 7th when we first saw the big plumes of smoke rise from the Palisades fire. And immediately the pattern matching ran astray. Oh, it's probably just like Franklin. It's not big yet, they'll get it out. They usually do. Well, they didn't.</div><div><br />By the late afternoon, we had once more packed our bags, and by then it was also clear that things actually were different this time. Different worse. Different enough that even Santa Monica didn't feel like it was assured to be safe. So we headed far North, to be sure that we wouldn't have to evacuate again. Turned out to be a good move.</div><div><br />Because by now, into the evening, few people in the connected world hadn't started to see the catastrophic images emerging from the Palisades and Eaton fires. Well over 10,000 houses would ultimately burn. Entire neighborhoods leveled. Pictures that could be mistaken for World War II. Utter and complete destruction.<br /><br /></div><div>By the night of the 7th, the fire reached our canyon, and it tore through the chaparral and brush that'd been building since the last big fire that area saw in 1993. Out of some 150 houses in our immediate vicinity, nearly a hundred burned to the ground. Including the first house we moved to in Malibu back in 2009. But thankfully not ours.</div><div><br />That's of course a huge relief. This was and is our Malibu Dream House. The site of that gorgeous home office I'm so fond to share views from. Our home.</div><div><br />But a house left standing in a disaster zone is still a disaster. The flames reached all the way up to the base of our construction, incinerated much of our landscaping, and devoured the power poles around it to dysfunction.</div><div><br />We have burnt-out buildings every which way the eye looks. The national guard is still stationed at road blocks on the access roads. Utility workers are tearing down the entire power grid to rebuild it from scratch. It's going to be a long time before this is comfortably habitable again.<br /><br /></div><div>So we left.<br /><br /></div><div>That in itself feels like defeat. There's an urge to stay put, and to help, in whatever helpless ways you can. But with three school-age children who've already missed over a months worth of learning from power outages, fire threats, actual fires, and now mudslide dangers, it was time to go.</div><div><br />None of this came as a surprise, mind you. After Woolsey in 2017, Malibu life always felt like living on borrowed time to us. We knew it, even accepted it. Beautiful enough to be worth the risk, we said.\u00a0<br /><br /></div><div>But even if it wasn't a surprise, it's still a shock. The sheer devastation, especially in the Palisades, went far beyond our normal range of comprehension. Bounded, as it always is, by past experiences.<br /><br /></div><div>Thus, we find ourselves back in Copenhagen. A safe haven for calamities of all sorts. We lived here for three years during the pandemic, so it just made sense to use it for refuge once more. The kids' old international school accepted them right back in, and past friendships were quickly rebooted.</div><div><br />I don't know how long it's going to be this time. And that's an odd feeling to have, just as America has been turning a corner, and just as the optimism is back in so many areas. Of the twenty years I've spent in America, this feels like the most exciting time to be part of the exceptionalism that the US of A offers.<br /><br />And of course we still are. I'll still be in the US all the time on both business, racing, and family trips. But it won't be exclusively so for a while, and it won't be from our Malibu Dream House. And that burns.<br /><br />  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--jpg\">\n      <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/9576a115/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHNLd2RzMzZOMiIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8aee607f23f14e231969ad51d33aecff2040674c/palisades-plumes.jpg?disposition=attachment\" title=\"Download palisades-plumes.jpg\">\n        <img alt=\"palisades-plumes.jpg\" src=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/9576a115/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHNLd2RzMzZOMiIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8aee607f23f14e231969ad51d33aecff2040674c/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJYW5CbkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--0b5e092e6240e14fab357b4c1013c9a0c881ff87/palisades-plumes.jpg\" />\n</a>\n  </figure></div>\n</div>"

They had already packed the Supreme Court for other reasons, so they had their captive court declare charter cities to be constitutional.</p><p>In 2022, the socialists took power from the conservatives and got the chance to fill the Supreme Court with <em>their</em> supporters, though this time it was routine and not fairly describable as &#8220;packing&#8221;. In September, this new Supreme Court said whoops, actually charter cities aren&#8217;t constitutional at all. They added that this decision applied retroactively, ie even existing charter cities that had been approved under the old government were, <em>ex post facto</em>, illegal.</p><p>Prospera&#8217;s lawyers objected, saying that the court is not allowed to make <em>ex post facto</em> rulings. But arguing that the Supreme Court is misinterpreting the Constitution seems like a losing battle - even if you&#8217;re right, who do you appeal to?</p><p>So the city is pursuing a two-pronged strategy. The first prong is waiting. Prospera is a collection of buildings and people. The buildings can stay standing, the people can still live there - they just have to follow regular Honduran law, rather than the investment-friendly charter they previously used. There&#8217;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Honduran_general_election\">another election in November</a>, which the socialists are expected to lose. Prospera hopes the conservatives will come in, take control of the Supreme Court again, and then they&#8217;ll say whoops, messed it up <em>again</em>, charter cities are constitutional after all.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d6fbd3-1c7f-4621-98a6-6ee191a8e9dd_1024x768.webp\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2d6fbd3-1c7f-4621-98a6-6ee191a8e9dd_1024x768.webp\" width=\"640\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">One of the charter city world&#8217;s many AI-generated pictures of beautiful buildings that will never be built.

Source is <a href=\"https://underthrow.substack.com/p/crypto-cities-summit-a-pilgrimage\">this blog by Max Borders</a>, which I think is a great name for a charter city proponent.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The second prong is international arbitration. When the conservatives approved charter cities, they signed international contracts promising their investment partners that Honduras wouldn&#8217;t go back on its word; if it did, they could be sued for damages. Prospera is suing for $10 billion, ~2/3 of Honduras&#8217; annual budget. Observers say they have good lawyers and a strong case. Honduras has responded by backing out of its agreements and saying it won&#8217;t accept international rulings, but this only goes so far; the agreements say Prospera can sue to confiscate Honduran assets abroad if the government won&#8217;t cooperate. So far they seem to be holding off on this, probably because they&#8217;d rather do this the easy way by waiting for the conservatives to retake power, but the lawsuit is a strong argument for whoever wins in November to see things their way.</p><p>You might expect this instability to chill investment, but apparently not - this January, another funding round led by Coinbase <a href=\"https://longevity.technology/news/coinbase-invests-in-prospera-to-expand-global-economic-freedom/\">raised an extra $30 million</a> for the beleaguered city. They must have balls of steel!</p><p>It looks like a big part of investors&#8217; hope for Prospera is biotech research and medical tourism. It hosted the <a href=\"https://www.lifespan.io/news/vitalia-living-the-longevity-dream/\">Vitalia</a> conference, and the Vitalia team are trying to build on it with <a href=\"https://infinitavc.com/\">Infinita</a>, a charter city VC, and <a href=\"https://viva.city/\">Viva</a>, a broader program and potential more permanent hub.. I still think that Minicircle, the most famous biotech clinic currently in Prospera, is <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT7_6kWkIqrvzFZvs88O_NqVzmn-NPINvHOLM-A6r_ieZyvnJsNVk4FSU7EYrePnQg9gT_3kwahJESZ/pub\">either confused or fraudulent</a>, but hopefully they can eventually attract firms which are neither. </p><h2>Neom Neom Neom Neom Neom</h2><p>Neom, Saudi Arabia&#8217;s insane giant linear city project, has <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/saudi-arabia-scales-back-neom-plans-focus-world-cup-asian-games\">admitted </a>they cannot actually build a giant linear city.</p><p>&#8230;sort of!

happened often!) The new CEO is <a href=\"https://www.neom.com/en-us/newsroom/neom-board-of-directors-announces-leadership-change\">Aiman Al-Mudaifer</a>.</p><p>Last year, I predicted with 99% confidence that less than one kilometer of NEOM&#8217;s linear city would get built.

America?</h2><p>In 2023, Trump <a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/article/building-freedom-cities\">proposed</a> building ten &#8220;freedom cities&#8221;. </p><div class=\"youtube-wrap\" id=\"youtube2-dJA_GBhCGgE\"><div class=\"youtube-inner\"></div></div><p>As usual, he&#8217;s light on details, but says that the federal government owns lots of land, it&#8217;s mostly unused, and he wants to \"hold a contest to charter ten new cities and award them to the best proposals for development\". </p><p>I bet Charter Cities Institute has already tried to reach out to the administration on this. You can see hints of where they might go in <a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/article/building-freedom-cities\">Mark Lutter&#8217;s piece in City Journal. </a>As usual, he bangs the drum of &#8220;agglomeration effects&#8221; - new cities only prosper if there is some reason for them to exist. If you build a city on the median patch of federal land - a random desert - you&#8217;ll have an uphill battle to make anyone move there. </p><p>He proposes some alternatives, of which the most controversial is the Presidio - a federally-owned historic fortress in the middle of San Francisco which is now mostly used as a park. But the government technically has the rights to the land, and if they wanted to, they could zone the whole thing for six-story apartments and add 120,000 people to SF. I don&#8217;t know which part of this is most likely to make San Franciscans explode with rage - the loss of their (admittedly beautiful) historic park, the Donald Trump involvement, or the prospect of actually building things in their city.

But after <a href=\"https://www.solanotogether.org/post/poll-shows-solano-county-voters-overwhelmingly-reject-california-forever-solano-together-calls-for\">polls suggested</a> they might lose, they instead struck an agreement with the county to delay two years and run through the usual set of environmental impact assessments. The County Supervisor <a href=\"https://californiaforever.com/joint-statement-by-solano-county-and-california-forever/\">wrote</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I think it signals [project lead] Jan Sramek&#8217;s understanding that while the need for more affordable housing and good paying jobs has merit, the timing has been unrealistic. I want to acknowledge that many Solano residents are excited about Mr. Sramek&#8217;s optimism about a California that builds again. He is also right that we cannot solve our jobs, housing, and energy challenges if every project takes a decade or more to break ground.</p><p>But announcing last year that California Forever would seek a vote on the November 2024 ballot, without a full Environmental Impact Report and a fully negotiated Development Agreement, was a mistake. This politicized the entire project, made it difficult for us and our staff to work with them, and forced everyone in our community to take sides.</p><p>Delaying the vote gives everyone a chance to pause and work together, which is what is needed.</p></blockquote><p>Opponents seemed optimistic that this would give them time to crush the project, or at least frustrate the investors enough to make them go away.</p><p>But in the past few days, the situation has changed. Suisun City, a nearby small town, has announced that <a href=\"https://www.globest.com/2025/01/30/city-in-solano-county-moves-to-annex-california-forever-land/?slreturn=20250131135142\">it is considering annexing</a> the California Forever land. Since the project was previously blocked by laws restricting building on <em>unincorporated</em> land, getting annexed by a city - and maybe running their project under the Suisun City banner - would solve many of their problems. Suisun City is struggling financially, and it would make sense for them to offer legal protection in exchange for money. The city mayor sort of halfway-kind-of-denies that&#8217;s what she&#8217;s doing, but California Forever is unpopular among Suisun City voters - if the story were actually false, I would expect her to make stronger denials.</p><h2>You Had Me At &#8220;Dragon King&#8221;</h2><p>In 2021, Art Finch proposed that Bhutan turn the village of Geluphu into a cool high-tech charter city that would create jobs for Bhutanese youth and prevent them from emigrating. Finch, a South-African-American entrepreneur with Bhutanese connections, got the highest levels of the government to listen to his idea. Then something went wrong. Based on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bhutan/comments/12w1wle/the_yung_drung_incident/\">this thread</a>, it seems like a Facebook video about the project went viral, the Bhutanese people had the usual qualms about Thiel-backed billionaire startup Silicon Valley whatever stealing their precious sovereignty (of <em>course</em> it was Thiel-backed), and the deal fell apart.</p><p>So far this is the story of <em>every</em> promising charter city, but what happened next was a little different - the Dragon King of Bhutan (of <em>course</em> they&#8217;re ruled by a Dragon King) announced that Bhutan would build their own version of the city, without Silicon Valley help. Thus <a href=\"https://gmc.bt/\">Geluphu Mindfulness City Special Administrative Region</a>. Construction started in 2023.</p><p>The target population is one million (Bhutan&#8217;s current largest city, Thimphu, has a population of only 100,000, and is famous for being one of only two national capitals without traffic lights). The projected cost is $100 billion with a b (Bhutan&#8217;s current GDP is $3 billion/year). </p><p>So how are they going to do this? Bhutan&#8217;s usual strategy is to play off neighbors India and China against each other, seeing which of them will give it more money in exchange for its friendship. Some American investors also seem interested. But it&#8217;s not even clear what industries would be involved - proposals include agribusiness, hydroelectric power, and - the last refuge of every desperate poor country - cryptocurrency (you can

They had already packed the Supreme Court for other reasons, so they had their captive court declare charter cities to be constitutional.</p><p>In 2022, the socialists took power from the conservatives and got the chance to fill the Supreme Court with <em>their</em> supporters, though this time it was routine and not fairly describable as &#8220;packing&#8221;. In September, this new Supreme Court said whoops, actually charter cities aren&#8217;t constitutional at all. They added that this decision applied retroactively, ie even existing charter cities that had been approved under the old government were, <em>ex post facto</em>, illegal.</p><p>Prospera&#8217;s lawyers objected, saying that the court is not allowed to make <em>ex post facto</em> rulings. But arguing that the Supreme Court is misinterpreting the Constitution seems like a losing battle - even if you&#8217;re right, who do you appeal to?</p><p>So the city is pursuing a two-pronged strategy.

                "<p>An observant Jewish friend told me she has recurring dreams about being caught unprepared for Shabbat.</p><p>(Shabbat is the Jewish Sabbath, celebrated every Saturday, when observant Jews are forbidden to work, drive, carry things outdoors, spend money, use electrical devices, etc.)</p><p>She said that in the dreams, she would be out driving, far from home, and realize that Shabbat was due to begin in a few minutes, with no way to make it home or get a hotel in time.</p><p>I found this interesting because <em>my</em> recurring dreams are usually things like being caught unprepared for a homework assignment I have due tomorrow, or realizing I have to catch a plane flight but I&#8217;m not packed and don&#8217;t have a plan to get to the airport.</p><p>Most people attribute recurring nightmares to &#8220;fear&#8221;. My friend is &#8220;afraid&#8221; of violating Shabbat; childhood me was &#8220;afraid&#8221; of having the assignment due the next day. This seems wrong to me. Childhood me was afraid of monsters in the closet; adult me is afraid of heart attacks, AI, and something happening to my family. But I don&#8217;t have nightmares about any of these things, just homework assignments and plane flights.</p><p>So maybe the &#8220;unprepared&#8221; aspect is more important. Here&#8217;s a story that makes sense to me: what if recurring dreams are related to prospective memory?</p><p>Prospective memory is the form of memory you use to remember that something&#8217;s coming up and you need to prepare for it. For example, your teacher says &#8220;you have a homework project due on December 1&#8221;. More responsible people might write that down on a calendar or in a planner or something, but I always just winged it. Every few days, my brain would remind me, &#8220;You know you have a homework project due on December 1, right?&#8221; and then eventually I would grudgingly start working on it, and my brain would say &#8220;You remember you have to be done by December 1, right?&#8221; and then I would work harder. </p><p>How does this work? You&#8217;d have to have some kind of brain cell or whatever on a dedicated loop, checking every few hours to see if there&#8217;s a homework assignment you&#8217;ve forgotten about. This isn&#8217;t just the much easier task of answering &#8220;yes&#8221; if someone asks you whether you have an assignment. This requires the brain cell to constantly ping memory to see whether there&#8217;s something that&#8217;s being forgotten.</p><p>What if that brain cell is still there? What if, every few hours, it keeps thinking &#8220;Oh no, I hope there isn&#8217;t a homework assignment I&#8217;ve forgotten about, better sift through my memory and see&#8221;? And during the day, my brain is functional enough to bar such useless thoughts from my consciousness, but at night, when my guard is down and there&#8217;s nothing else to think about, sometimes it gets through? And what if the dreaming brain uses that as the nucleus for a story?</p><p>This explains my friend&#8217;s Shabbat dreams, my homework dreams, and my forgotten-plane-flight dreams. What other categories of dreams does it explain?</p><p><strong>Big test today I forgot to study for: </strong>This is a trivial extension of the homework example. I don&#8217;t really have these because I found tests less scary than homework and didn&#8217;t really keep track of them as much.</p><p><strong>Enrolled in a class I forgot existed for months and now it&#8217;s the end of the year and I&#8217;m going to fail it: </strong>Presumably your prospective memory has to remember to go to the right series of classes every day at school.</p><p><strong>Giving a speech in your underwear: </strong>This one doesn&#8217;t fit the theory, unless maybe the prospective memory task is &#8220;getting dressed&#8221;. This is, in some sense, a very important prospective memory task! I guess there does have to be some brain subroutine monitoring whether I&#8217;m dressed every time I go outside, and it&#8217;s just so fluid that I never think about it. But at that level you could explain <em>anything</em>, so I&#8217;m skeptical.</p><p><strong>Flying: </strong>I don&#8217;t think my theory can explain this. I&#8217;ve heard claims that it&#8217;s because muscle feedback is blocked during REM sleep, so you feel weightless. I rarely have pure flying dreams, but I often have dreams about finding I can jump very high, glide, or otherwise come close. I don&#8217;t know if the muscle feedback theory predicts this.</p><p><strong>Teeth falling out: </strong>I originally thought this might be related to brushing your teeth - one of the most common and important prospective memory tasks. But this doesn&#8217;t really make sense - you&#8217;d expect dreams about leaving home and suddenly realizing that you forgot to brush your teeth; the link to &#8220;teeth falling out&#8221; is psychologically tenuous. And <a href=\"https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/coffeeroom/topic/teeth-falling-out\">these people</a> note there are tooth-falling-out dreams in the Talmud; even though Talmud-era Persia had a little dental hygiene, I have trouble believing that a culture-bound dream could last that long. <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01812/full\">Some researchers did a study</a> and found tooth dreams were linked to dental irritation symptoms during the day, so it&#8217;s probably the same as the flying dreams - your unconscious using weird sensations as the nucleus for a story. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruxism\">Sleep bruxism</a> is a common condition that could cause unusual nighttime tooth sensations, although the researchers disappointingly weren&#8217;t able to come up with a specific link there.</p><p>So I think there&#8217;s some support for the prospective memory theory, but even more for a theory of &#8220;dreams that are based on weird sensations you have during sleep are likely to recur&#8221;. </p><p>Is there any way to fit the Shabbat/homework/plane-flight dreams into a &#8220;weird sensations you have during sleep&#8221; theory? I think you&#8217;d have to go with &#8220;you feel anxious during sleep, and those are the situations your brain comes up with where anxious is justified&#8221;. The reason you don&#8217;t dream about closet monsters or unfriendly AI is presumably that you haven&#8217;t experienced these things, and your brain doesn&#8217;t naturally think of them as a likely cause of anxiety.</p><p>I don&#8217;t find this entirely compelling, because I don&#8217;t think &#8220;For the whole semester, I half-forgot that I was taking a math class, and now I&#8217;m finally being forced to confront it, and all the other students are so far ahead of me that I can never catch up&#8221; is a simple natural experience which it makes sense to leap to as a cause of anxiety. The most common stressful experiences I have regularly - patients having emergencies, babies being inconsolable, people trying to cancel me online - almost never show up in my dreams. On the other hand, I do sometimes have dreams about fights with my parents, so maybe it has to be a stressful experience from my childhood in particular. But then why do I have so many dreams about missing airplanes, which wasn&#8217;t something childhood-me had to deal with? And when I asked about this on <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/acx-survey-results-2024\">the ACX survey</a>, it looked like childhood themes in dreams were less common than adult themes:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb52aeb24-3dd5-4206-bb05-500dd1206203_491x337.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"337\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb52aeb24-3dd5-4206-bb05-500dd1206203_491x337.png\" width=\"491\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">How often do these themes appear in your dreams, scale of 1-5, n = 4,740</figcaption></figure></div><p>So I think there&#8217;s strong evidence for a somatic-sensation-nucleus theory of recurring dreams, and weaker but still-intriguing evidence for a prospective-memory-based one.</p>"
