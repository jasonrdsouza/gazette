                "<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/cover.webp\" /><p>Syntax highlighting is a tool. It can help you read code faster. Find things quicker. Orient yourself in a large file.</p>\n<p>Like any tool, it can be used correctly or incorrectly. Let\u2019s see how to use syntax highlighting to help you work.</p>\n<h1 id=\"christmas-lights-diarrhea\">Christmas Lights Diarrhea</h1>\n<p>Most color themes have a unique bright color for literally everything: one for variables, another for language keywords, constants, punctuation, functions, classes, calls, comments, etc.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it gets so bad one can\u2019t see the base text color: everything is highlighted. What\u2019s the base text color here?</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/diarrhea.webp\" /></figure>\n<p>The problem with that is, if everything is highlighted, nothing stands out. Your eye adapts and considers it a new norm: everything is bright and shiny, and instead of getting separated, it all blends together.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a quick test. Try to find the function definition here:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/definitions_bad.webp\" /></figure>\n<p>and here:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/definitions_good.webp\" /></figure>\n<p>See what I mean?</p>\n<p>So yeah, unfortunately, you can\u2019t just highlight everything. You have to make decisions: what is more important, what is less. What should stand out, what shouldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Highlighting everything is like assigning \u201ctop priority\u201d to every task in Linear. It only works if most of the tasks have lesser priorities.</p>\n<p class=\"loud\">If everything is highlighted, nothing is highlighted.</p>\n<h1 id=\"enough-colors-to-remember\">Enough colors to remember</h1>\n<p>There are two main use-cases you want your color theme to address:</p>\n<ol start=\"1\">\n  <li>Look at something and tell what it is by its color (you can tell by reading text, yes, but why do you need syntax highlighting then?)</li>\n  <li>Search for something. You want to know what to look for (which color).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>1 is a direct index lookup: color \u2192 type of thing.</p>\n<p>2 is a reverse lookup: type of thing \u2192 color.</p>\n<p>Truth is, most people don\u2019t do these lookups at all. They might think they do, but in reality, they don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Let me illustrate. Before:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/change_before.webp\" /></figure>\n<p>After:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/change_after.webp\" /></figure>\n<p>Can you see it? I misspelled <code>return</code> for <code>retunr</code> and its color switched from red to purple.</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s another test. Close your eyes (not yet! Finish this sentence first) and try to remember what color your color theme uses for class names?</p>\n<p>Can you?</p>\n<p>If the answer for both questions is \u201cno\u201d, then your color theme is <em>not functional</em>. It might give you comfort (as in\u2014I feel safe. If it\u2019s highlighted, it\u2019s probably code) but you can\u2019t use it as a tool. It doesn\u2019t <em>help</em> you.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s the solution? Have an absolute minimum of colors. So little that they all fit in your head at once. For example, my color theme, Alabaster, only uses four:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Green for strings</li>\n  <li>Purple for constants</li>\n  <li>Yellow for comments</li>\n  <li>Light blue for top-level definitions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That\u2019s it! And I was able to type it all from memory, too. This minimalism allows me to actually do lookups: if I\u2019m looking for a string, I know it will be green. If I\u2019m looking at something yellow, I know it\u2019s a comment.</p>\n<p class=\"loud\">Limit the number of different colors to what you can remember.</p>\n<p>If you swap green and purple in my editor, it\u2019ll be a catastrophe. If somebody swapped colors in yours, would you even notice?</p>\n<h1 id=\"what-should-you-highlight\">What should you highlight?</h1>\n<p>Something there isn\u2019t a lot of. Remember\u2014we want highlights to stand out. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t highlight variables or function calls\u2014they are everywhere, your code is probably 75% variable names and function calls.</p>\n<p>I do highlight constants (numbers, strings). These are usually used more sparingly and often are reference points\u2014a lot of logic paths start from constants.</p>\n<p>Top-level definitions are another good idea. They give you an idea of a structure quickly.</p>\n<p>Punctuation: it helps to separate names from syntax a little bit, and you care about names first, especially when quickly scanning code.</p>\n<p>Please, please don\u2019t highlight language keywords. <code>class</code>, <code>function</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>stuff like this. You rarely look for them: \u201cwhere\u2019s that if\u201d is a valid question, but you will be looking not at the <code>if</code> the keyword, but at the condition after it. The condition is the important, distinguishing part. The keyword is not.</p>\n<p class=\"loud\">Highlight names and constants. Grey out punctuation. Don\u2019t highlight language keywords.</p>\n<h1 id=\"comments-are-important\">Comments are important</h1>\n<p>The tradition of using grey for comments comes from the times when people were paid by line. If you have something like</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/javadoc.webp\" /></figure>\n<p>of course you would want to grey it out! This is bullshit text that doesn\u2019t add anything and was written to be ignored.</p>\n<p>But for good comments, the situation is opposite. Good comments ADD to the code. They explain something that couldn\u2019t be expressed directly. They are <em>important</em>.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/yellow_comments.webp\" /></figure>\n<p>So here\u2019s another controversial idea:</p>\n<p class=\"loud\">Comments should be highlighted, not hidden away.</p>\n<p>Use bold colors, draw attention to them. Don\u2019t shy away. If somebody took the time to tell you something, then you want to read it.</p>\n<h1 id=\"two-types-of-comments\">Two types of comments</h1>\n<p>Another secret nobody is talking about is that there are two types of comments:</p>\n<ol start=\"1\">\n  <li>Explanations</li>\n  <li>Disabled code</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Most languages don\u2019t distinguish between those, so there\u2019s not much you can do syntax-wise. Sometimes there\u2019s a convention (e.g. <code>--</code> vs <code>/* */</code> in SQL), then use it!</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a real example from Clojure codebase that makes perfect use of two types of comments:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/two_types_of_comments.webp\" /><figcaption>Disabled code is gray, explanation is bright yellow</figcaption></figure>\n<h1 id=\"light-or-dark\">Light or dark?</h1>\n<p>Per statistics, 70% of developers prefer dark themes. Being in the other 30%, that question always puzzled me. Why?</p>\n<p>And I think I have an answer. Here\u2019s a typical dark theme:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/vscode_default_dark@2x.webp\" /></figure>\n<p>and here\u2019s a light one:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/vscode_default_light@2x.webp\" /></figure>\n<p>On the latter one, colors are way less vibrant. Here, I picked them out for you:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/vscode_colors@2x.png\" /><figcaption>Notice how many colors there are. No one can remember that many.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This is because dark colors are in general less distinguishable and more muddy. Look at Hue scale as we move brightness down:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/brightness_hue@2x.webp\" /></figure>\n<p>Basically, in the dark part of the spectrum, you just get fewer colors to play with. There\u2019s no \u201cdark yellow\u201d or good-looking \u201cdark teal\u201d.</p>\n<p>Nothing can be done here. There are no magic colors hiding somewhere that have both good contrast on a white background and look good at the same time. By choosing a light theme, you are dooming yourself to a very limited, bad-looking, barely distinguishable set of dark colors.</p>\n<p>So it makes sense. Dark themes do look better. Or rather: light ones can\u2019t look good. Science \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af</p>\n<p>But!</p>\n<p>But.</p>\n<p>There is one trick you can do, that I don\u2019t see a lot of. Use background colors! Compare:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/bg_highlight@2x.png\" /></figure>\n<p>The first one has nice colors, but the contrast is too low: letters become hard to read.</p>\n<p>The second one has good contrast, but you can barely see colors.</p>\n<p>The last one has <em>both</em>: high contrast and clean, vibrant colors. Lighter colors are readable even on a white background since they fill a lot more area. Text is the same brightness as in the second example, yet it gives the impression of clearer color. It\u2019s all upside, really.</p>\n<p>UI designers know about this trick for a while, but I rarely see it applied in code editors:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/badge.png\" /></figure>\n<p>If your editor supports choosing background color, give it a try. It might open light themes for you.</p>\n<h1 id=\"bold-and-italics\">Bold and italics</h1>\n<p>Don\u2019t use. This goes into the same category as too many colors. It\u2019s just another way to highlight something, and you don\u2019t need too many, because you can\u2019t highlight everything.</p>\n<p>In theory, you might try to <em>replace</em> colors with typography. Would that work? I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t seen any examples.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/typography.png\" /><figcaption>Using italics and bold instead of colors</figcaption></figure>\n<h1 id=\"myth-of-number-based-perfection\">Myth of number-based perfection</h1>\n<p>Some themes pay too much attention to be scientifically uniform. Like, all colors have the same exact lightness, and hues are distributed evenly on a circle.</p>\n<p>This could be nice (to know if you have OCR), but in practice, it doesn\u2019t work as well as it sounds:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/balanced.png\" /><figcaption>OkLab l=0.7473 c=0.1253 h=0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The idea of highlighting is to make things stand out. If you make all colors the same lightness and chroma, they will look very similar to each other, and it\u2019ll be hard to tell them apart.</p>\n<p>Our eyes are way more sensitive to differences in lightness than in color, and we should use it, not try to negate it.</p>\n<h1 id=\"lets-design-a-color-theme-together\">Let\u2019s design a color theme together</h1>\n<p>Let\u2019s apply these principles step by step and see where it leads us. We start with the theme from the start of this post:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/dyi00.png\" /></figure>\n<p>First, let\u2019s remove highlighting from language keywords and re-introduce base text color:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/dyi10.png\" /></figure>\n<p>Next, we remove color from variable usage:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/dyi20.png\" /></figure>\n<p>and from function/method invocation:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/dyi30.png\" /></figure>\n<p>The thinking is that your code is mostly references to variables and method invocation. If we highlight those, we\u2019ll have to highlight more than 75% of your code.</p>\n<p>Notice that we\u2019ve kept variable declarations. These are not as ubiquitous and help you quickly answer a common question: where does thing thing come from?</p>\n<p>Next, let\u2019s tone down punctuation:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/dyi40.png\" /></figure>\n<p>I prefer to dim it a little bit because it helps names stand out more. Names alone can give you the general idea of what\u2019s going on, and the exact configuration of brackets is rarely equally important.</p>\n<p>But you might roll with base color punctuation, too:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/dyi40_alt.png\" /></figure>\n<p>Okay, getting close. Let\u2019s highlight comments:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/dyi50.png\" /></figure>\n<p>We don\u2019t use red here because you usually need it for squiggly lines and errors.</p>\n<p>This is still one color too many, so I unify numbers and strings to both use green:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/dyi60.png\" /></figure>\n<p>Finally, let\u2019s rotate colors a bit. We want to respect nesting logic, so function declarations should be brighter (yellow) than variable declarations (blue).</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/dyi70.png\" /></figure>\n<p>Compare with what we started:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/dyi00.png\" /></figure>\n<p>In my opinion, we got a much more workable color theme: it\u2019s easier on the eyes and helps you find stuff faster.</p>\n<h1 id=\"shameless-plug-time\">Shameless plug time</h1>\n<p>I\u2019ve been applying these principles for <a href=\"https://github.com/tonsky/vscode-theme-alabaster/commit/5c840f5fb57e5cd0dce93ac8c450495bdb0a2658\">about 8 years now</a>.</p>\n<p>I call this theme Alabaster and I\u2019ve built it a couple of times for the editors I used:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/tonsky/vscode-theme-alabaster\">VS Code</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/tonsky/intellij-alabaster\">JetBrains IDEs</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster\">Sublime Text</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/tonsky/clojure-sublimed/?tab=readme-ov-file#color-scheme\">twice</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It\u2019s also been ported to many other editors and terminals; the most complete list is <a href=\"https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster?tab=readme-ov-file#variations-1\">probably here</a>. If your editor is not on the list, try searching for it by name\u2014it might be built-in already! I always wondered where these color themes come from, and now I became an author of one (and I still don\u2019t know).</p>\n<p>Feel free to use Alabaster as is or build your own theme using the principles outlined in the article\u2014either is fine by me.</p>\n<p>As for the principles themselves, they worked out fantastically for me. I\u2019ve never wanted to go back, and just one look at any \u201ctraditional\u201d color theme gives me a scare now.</p>\n<p>I <em>suspect</em> that the only reason we don\u2019t see more restrained color themes is that people never really thought about it. Well, this is your wake-up call. I hope this will inspire people to use color more deliberately and to change the default way we build and use color themes.</p>"

It means going on Amazon and seeing crap. It\u2019s an easier problem to attack but not at all trivial.</p>\n<p>Eg broken Amazon reviews won\u2019t let you find one non-crappy product even if it exists.</p>\n<p>Or to put it in another way: we live in an economy, not just a legal system. I too feel like there could and should be a libertarian solution rather than a tyrannical one, but I\u2019m not in denial about the problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are also times when you don\u2019t want to compete for the good stuff. Or when this makes it easy for you to save money or turn a profit, and it goes well for you.</p>\n<p>Most of the time, no, you want everyone to choose wisely. When others have good taste, and choose quality products, the market produces quality products. If not, not. When they rate things properly, you can find the good stuff. When we collectively make choices that enrich everyone, that too is good for everyone, and so on. It\u2019s #NotOnlyPolicy.</p>\n<p>Again, no, you shouldn\u2019t coerce these choices, but you mostly don\u2019t want to live in a world where everyone else is squandering their money in dumb ways.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Maybe Don\u2019t Say Maybe</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103125000952\">Hosts don\u2019t like it when you reply \u2018maybe,\u2019 they\u2019d feel more respected if you said \u2018no</a>\u2019 when invited to an event. Certainly by saying \u2018maybe\u2019 you are making life easier for you and harder for the host. Invitees told themselves the \u2018maybe\u2019 indicated interest, which it does, but it\u2019s mainly annoying since you have to plan for both outcomes.</p>\n<p>Thus, you should only reply \u2018maybe\u2019 if you get high value from the option, or you attending provides a lot of value to the host and you\u2019re genuinely unsure. Assume that by doing so you are imposing a cost.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Throwing Good Parties Means Throwing Parties</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.atvbt.com/21-facts-about-throwing-good-parties/\">Uri gives us 21 Facts About Throwing Good Parties (via MR</a>). Mostly seems like great advice starting with the \u2018announce at a quarter-hour so people will only be 15 minutes late,\u2019 especially if you are trying to optimize the party as a public service.</p>\n<p>My biggest new takeaway is I was under considering the \u2018know who else is going\u2019 value of using apps like Partiful or Luma. I strongly endorse that if you want to leave a group at a party, you straight up walk away, don\u2019t say anything (and if a group is bigger than ~5, strongly consider leaving it).</p>\n<p>One thing I challenge is that he thinks if you are gender imbalanced, the sparse gender will stop attending. It\u2019s definitely true that women become apprehensive if too outnumbered, but running the other way is probably symptomatic of party design that didn\u2019t appeal to men in the first place. Men are not, in general, less likely to show up to a party when there\u2019s going to be more women.</p>\n<p>My biggest old takeaway, the first one on the list this time, that throwing a part at all is good, is you are not throwing enough parties, and you should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. The MVP (minimum viable party) is inviting friends over, providing some food, and chilling. That\u2019s a remarkably valuable public service. If obsessing over details would top you from throwing or enjoying it, skip those details.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/monthly-roundup-26-january-2025\">One can compare this to</a> <a href=\"https://auren.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-guide-to-holding-world?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=65520&amp;post_id=151795978&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=3o9&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email\">Auren Hoffman\u2019s advice</a> for dinner parties, which I discussed in the January 2025 roundup, where again a central theme is not letting perfect be the enemy of the good. I stand by my disagreement there that it is important in a dinner party that the food be good. It is less important for other party formats, but also in a pinch not so difficult to make the food good because delivery services exist.</p>\n<p>Also one can reiterate <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/monthly-roundup-19-june-2024#:~:text=Curation%20of%20people%20is%20key.%20You%20only%20need%2014%20square%20feet%20of%20active%20party%20space%20per%20person.%20Create%20talking%20spaces%20where%20people%20face%20each%20other\">this thread from Kasay and my commentary on it</a> from June 2024, especially that you only need 14 square feet per person, and that ultimately the most important decision is who to invite, with another key factor being engineering a space to create alcoves of conversation.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Air Travel Gets Worse</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/SilvermanJacob/status/1967382332022858056\">Airplanes seem</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1967384442491769282\">to have</a> a growing systemic problem with <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/air-travel-toxic-fumes-64839d6e?mod=Searchresults&amp;pos=2&amp;page=1\">exposing passengers to fumes in a way that is importantly bad for their health</a>, which they have handled badly and covered up in similar fashion to other industries with similar health issues.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Eliezer Yudkowsky: If it\u2019s true, aircraft manufacturers and airlines are engaging in a classic denial-coverup in the style of cigarette companies, leaded gasoline makers, or AI builders.

Claude did a worst-case scenario estimate based on the claims and came up with a cost per flight of 0.00003 QALY, which is still at least one order of magnitude lower than any alternative form of transportation.</p>\n<p>But this is worth noticing.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bad News</h4>\n\n\n<p>The French left is being heavily influenced by a so-called \u2018economist\u2019 <a href=\"https://x.com/XFaure/status/1970803488511914149\">advocating for ultimately instituting an 8% annual wealth tax</a>, also known as full confiscatory taxation of all wealth subject to such a tax, which can then serve as a warning to the next ten generations. Nine of which will presumably forget, but that\u2019s the way it goes.</p>\n<p>Halloween, a holiday so not deep that you don\u2019t even get the day off of work or school, is out of control, complete with not only sales and banners but people who put intentional nightmare fuel (as in, items intentionally created to be scary especially to kids) <a href=\"https://x.com/webdevMason/status/1971670176501473711\">on display for over a month</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lady Nimby: Why would you want this at your doorstep for 10% of your life?

There is also a lot of good news in the world.</p>\n<p>I cannot emphasize enough that the existence of bad news, and especially of political bad news, should not be a constant preface to conversation or good news.</p>\n<p>You do not need to continuously self-flagellate to show that you care about the bad news. If others do insist that you do this, that is no good, you need to push back.</p>\n<p>This applies across all causes, across the political spectrum, and it especially applies to AI and the fact that it is likely that someone is going to build superintelligence and then everyone will die.

This is not a realistic ask.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/jasonfurman/status/1976608398079610900\">There was insider trading of the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize</a>. Which is good.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jason Furman: The other day a student asked me about the prevalence of insider trading in prediction markets. I now have an answer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rSP-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F263c31ed-a941-432c-9add-483e6ab2f91b_1200x1138.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>If I was asked to draw a graph of what insider trading on a prediction market looks like, I would draw this graph. At a time when the outcome could plausibly be known, a rapid shoot upwards of the winner, up to some upper limit that still allows substantial gains, then settling at that limit, until the jump to ~100%.</p>\n<p>The even better news is that since insider trading mostly exhibits such obvious patterns, it is easy to avoid it. Here, there are two easy principles to learn.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do not trade after the decision has already been made and could be known.</li>\n<li>If you must trade, do not trade against this kind of sharp move up.</li>\n<li>Definitely, absolutely do not have resting sell orders on the book this late.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The person buying is claiming to know the outcome, that the fair price is 100. You might choose to trade against that person if you think they\u2019re often wrong, but understand that this is what you will be doing.</p>\n<p>Should insider trading be allowed here, as it is on Polymarket? I say yes. It depends on your goal. Do you want to be able to trade at and know the non-insider price, or to know the insider price and info? You can get at most one of those two things.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-10/unusual-bets-on-nobel-peace-prize-winner-prompt-probe-into-leaks\">Norwegian officials are predictably not amused</a> by this particular bout of insider trading, and are investigating what they call a \u2018criminal actor who wants to earn money on our information.\u2019</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/Polymarket/status/1976821993606615231\">Polymarket</a>: JUST IN: It has been revealed only 5 people at the Nobel Peace Prize foundation knew the winner before they were announced.</p>\n<p>Everyone checking Polymarket knew.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/robinhanson/status/1976716452234186994\">A good periodic reminder of one reason people often reject prediction markets</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Robin Hanson: Years ago a NYC based software firm ran some prediction markets, hoping in part to find &amp; promote \u201cdiamonds in the rough\u201d employees who predict especially well.

I see what he\u2019s trying to do to connect them and both are interesting, but I think mostly distinct.</p>\n<p>The obligation to respond is that if others see a criticism [Z] to which you don\u2019t respond, or others mischaracterize your [X] as if you said [Y] and respond to [Y], and especially if others then argue about [Y], then you\u2019re in trouble. In the first case, your failure to respond will imply you don\u2019t have a good response to [Z]. In the second case, they\u2019ll start to believe you really did say [Y].</p>\n<p>The ultimate source of this obligation to respond is, essentially, that your failure to respond would be Bayesian evidence of inability to respond, or to respond well.</p>\n<p>As in, if I get a comment [C] that says [Z], and I had a good response [R] that answers [Z], then why didn\u2019t I respond to [Z] with [R]? A conspicuous non-answer suggests I don\u2019t know of any such [R]. A bad answer [B] also suggests I don\u2019t have a good [R].</p>\n<p>A non-conspicuous non-answer does not. One price of consistently engaging with critical comments or statements, in any context, is that an increasing share of non-answers become conspicuous.</p>\n<p>Indeed, one of the reasons I rarely respond to comments these days is that I do not wish to create this obligation to respond to other comments, to avoid the time sink. When I do consider a comment worth responding to, because many would want to see that, I will often do so by quoting it in a full post.</p>\n<p>The theory on guess versus ask culture is that the distinction is about how many \u2018echoes\u2019 you trace. As in, ask culture traces zero echoes, you simply ask for what you want, and they are responsible for saying no and not holding the ask against you. Whereas guess culture traces one echo, you think about how they would respond, and you can imagine sophisticated others (guess harder!) tracking many echoes.</p>\n<p>I think this is an interesting idea but I don\u2019t think it is right. In both guess and ask culture, you are responsible for an unlimited number of potential echoes. The difference is what consequences and thus echoes an action causes.</p>\n<p>Technically speaking, I think the actual dial is either or both of these:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Narrowly: Ask culture is created by radically raising the penalty for imposing a penalty upon someone for refusing an explicit request.

If you try to respond that [Y] is less bad than [X], or that the new expansive definition covers things it shouldn\u2019t, people respond by claiming you\u2019re saying [X] is fine (or you\u2019re condoning [Y]). Other times, or eventually, things loop around, and definitions are so expansive the word becomes meaningless or fine, the same way mere \u2018speeding\u2019 is now ignored so they invented \u2018reckless driving.\u2019</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268125002458\">People are, according to a new study, \u2018much more likely</a>\u2019 <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/09/does-automation-reduce-stigma.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=does-automation-reduce-stigma\">to purchase</a> \u2018stigmatized\u2019 items like condoms and pregnancy tests at self-checkout counters.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: On the intensive margin, we show that stigmatized items are much more likely to be purchased at self-checkout than at cashier registers, especially condoms and pregnancy tests. We estimate that customers are willing to pay 8.5 cents in additional time cost for the privacy of purchasing stigmatized items at self-checkout.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I totally buy that if there is an open self-checkout line and an open cashier, and you are buying a pregnancy test, you are going to go for self-checkout on the intensive margin. Sure.</p>\n<p>But if anything, this effect looks surprisingly tiny. Customers are only willing to pay 8.5 cents in additional time? That\u2019s not a lot of stigma. If one values time at $20 per hour, then this is on the order of fifteen seconds. Do you have any idea what people will do in other contexts to avoid mild social awkwardness? If people had the opportunity to pay money to not have to look anyone in the eye, some would pay $0, but you could get some people for dollars, and also you can stimulate new demand.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/09/does-automation-reduce-stigma.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=does-automation-reduce-stigma\">Tyler Cowen</a>: I even draw distinctions across automated models.

Obviously you can\u2019t make everything in every algorithmic feed (or \u2018for you\u2019 page) the responsibility or speech of the platform, as the Third Circuit did here, or you effectively ban such feeds. Also obviously, if you intentionally steer users towards particular content sufficiently strongly, then that should be on you. So you need a limiting principle to determine what constitutes a sufficiently non-neutral algorithm.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/robertskmiles/status/1965924675281891754\">Sound advice from Rob Miles that bears repeating</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rob Miles: There are a bunch of really basic and easy ways to improve your social media experience that I see smart people not doing.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Turn off auto-playing wherever possible</li>\n<li>When you see something that you would prefer not to have seen, consider why it\u2019s on your feed, and use the tools to remove it.

Feed what you want, weed out what you don\u2019t. Just a few minutes of deliberate regular maintenance helps a lot.</li>\n<li>Try to never use social media apps, just view in the browser, where you\u2019re in control, and use tools like UBlock Origin and TamperMonkey to change things.

With notably rare exceptions in high value spots, the rule is to never, ever, ever interact with something you want to not see in the future, no matter how wrong someone is on the internet.

I am actually rather sympathetic to this in theory, because reputation should absolutely play a role in reach, and also if you shared people\u2019s reputations you can imagine what would happen next and all the accusations that would fly. The problem is I absolutely do not trust Elon Musk or Twitter to not put a thumb on the scale for various reasons both ideological and otherwise, and I also don\u2019t trust them to not mess this up.

This is a clear misunderstanding of the history of free speech, and an example of the kind of \u2018spreading negativity\u2019 that does indeed make you part of the problem, except unlike China I would never want to tell you that you couldn\u2019t say it.</p>\n<p>Free speech has always been constantly under attack even in America, and I\u2019m mostly not talking about the last decade. Our second president, John Adams, went hard after the speech of his opponents. We\u2019ve been going back and forth on this for a very long time. Woodrow Wilson went after it hard. McCarthyism went after it extremely hard. Things after 9/11 or around 2020 were very not good. And so on. Social pressure on speech, including by the government, is universal.</p>\n<p>It was only <a href=\"https://x.com/eigenrobot/status/1970495269037920271\">this month that YouTube agreed to reinstate (under new government pressure) the accounts</a> of those who were suspended for saying the wrong things about Covid under a very broad supposed \u2018misinformation\u2019 crackdown instigated by heavy pressure from the Biden Administration, and admitted that they did so under Biden Administration pressure to censor speech that did not violate YouTube\u2019s policies, which it now says was \u2018unacceptable and wrong.\u2019</p>\n<p>Many of the statements that got accounts suspended ultimately proved accurate, although of course many others were both highly irresponsible and highly false. Presumably, if I had done readings of my Covid posts on YouTube, or reposted the texts to Facebook, I would have been suspended many times over.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/Jim_Jordan/status/1970474487809265878\">Rep.

Performative lawsuits and wishful or general statements aside, so far from what I have seen actual consequences have been confined to people who decided to say ill-advised things specifically related to Charlie Kirk or his assassination, or at least to people\u2019s actions surrounding that. Which is a relatively reasonable and compact thing to get bad mad about. Even comedians have the rule of \u2018too soon.\u2019</p>\n<p>Let us not forget all the hard earned progress we have made, even if the last decade has involved some backsliding and dialectic escalation. That doesn\u2019t mean we can relax. We have to fight for this all the more. It does mean don\u2019t despair.</p>\n<p>Things are quite bad, but don\u2019t catastrophize. Whenever you see a decision like <a href=\"https://www.thefp.com/p/jawboning-and-jimmy-kimmel-free-speech-censorship\">Disney indefinitely caving on Kimmel</a>, suspending a show that was actively hemorrhaging money, you get people saying this means that they are now \u2018state owned media\u2019 or fascist or otherwise fully under state control. That\u2019s not how any of this works, and wouldn\u2019t be even if he had stayed off the air, although it was of course very good and right to exert a lot of pressure on Disney to bring him back.</p>\n<p>I also notice that, as terrible as this is, <a href=\"https://x.com/asymmetricinfo/status/1969135209112072447\">we don\u2019t need to be too concerned about broadcast television or its licenses any longer</a>. Only 4% of households rely on broadcast television. If you strike down a Kimmel or Colbert, and demand is there, you only make them stronger. I don\u2019t think we should sell off the broadcast spectrum, at least not quite yet. I think there\u2019s value in preserving the low-end solutions to things. But I wouldn\u2019t lose sleep over it if we did pull that plug entirely.</p>\n<p>If you strike down a Kimmel, and then there\u2019s enough noise that Disney puts him back, you\u2019ve very much gone into Streisand Effect territory and also royally pissed everyone involved off, pretty much across the comedy and journalist spectrums.</p>\n<p>Then if you respond to the restoration by announcing you\u2019re going to sue ABC, because they dared give into your previous lawsuit to bend the knee and keep the peace? <a href=\"https://x.com/ArmandDoma/status/1970683391482961972\">Yeah, I\u2019m guessing that is not going to go the way he would like.</a> It also makes it impossible to pretend Trump wasn\u2019t trying to coerce the network.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Xfnd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8b6c999-0f34-4ec0-adef-a97622adbbf9_1064x970.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/columns/apple-postponing-savant-charlie-kirk-huge-mistake-1236527471/\">AppleTV+ has decided to postpone Jessica Chastain in The Savant</a> in the wake of events.

This follows a long line of arguments of the form \u2018do not allocate [X] by price because the most valuable but neglected talent, especially prospective travelers, would then not buy enough [X], and that is the most important thing\u2019 where famously one [X] was traffic via congestion pricing.</p>\n<p>There is a real objection in such cases, which is that externalities exist that can\u2019t be properly priced in, and we are unwilling or unable to reasonably price such externalities, and thus pure allocation by price will fail to be a full first best solution.</p>\n<p>It still beats the current allocation strategy of allocation via lottery, or via allocation via willingness to wait in line, including for the purposes Tyler worries about, and is vastly better in the vast majority of allocation decisions. The current system already has a huge invisible graveyard of trips and talent and so on. Vivian Darkbloom points out that in this case that Pichar is a terrible example and would definitely have made it in under the $100k proposed fee, whereas without the fee he has to survive a lottery draw.</p>\n<p>I would bet that under a pure auction system (as in, you choose a fee that roughly clears the market), the amount of top talent secured goes way up, there will be a huge correlation with willingness to put up the $100k fee.

Sure, if you can identify them, also we have the O-1.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this is the best way to make the simple case: <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/tariffs-mean-you-pay-more-for-worse-products-e36855cf?mod=panda_wsj_custom_topic_alert\">Tariffs Mean You Pay More For Worse Products.</a> I prefer paying less for better products.</p>\n<p>It seems Trump took the government shutdown <a href=\"https://x.com/SherylNYT/status/1976833075515666690\">as a reason to fire a lot of people in the CDC</a>, with the final total expected to be between 1,100 and 1,200 people?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/samstein/status/1977051050822586410\">Sam Stein</a>: As the dust settles, it\u2019s clear that Vought\u2019s RIFs amount to a Friday night massacre at the CDC. Lots of confusion as to the total number gone. But several sources tell me top officials and many staff at the center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion and the center for immunization and respiratory diseases are OUT. Am told the Ebola response team has been hit hard too.</p>\n<p>Again, there is mass confusion. but it appears the government\u2019s chief agencies responding to outbreaks and studying infectious diseases have been gutted. if you know more we have a secure tip line here. I\u2019m also on signal asteinindc.09</p>\n<p>To put a finer point on it. I\u2019m told the ACTING DIRECTOR and CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases are now gone.</p>\n<p>Am told CDC\u2019s HR department had been furloughed because of the government shut down. They were then, un-furloughed so that they could process the RIFs to fire their colleagues. Can confirm. Some CDC experts who were RIFed on Friday have already had their firings rescinded by the administration.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is on top of the loss of 2,400 staff, or 18% of the agency, earlier in the year. About half the initial firings were rescinded this time around, it seems this government has a pattern of thinking it can fire a bunch of people and then say \u2018oops\u2019 on some of them later and it\u2019s no big deal, and in this case it seems they\u2019re blaming many of them on \u2018coding errors in their job classifications\u2019 which shows the level of attention to detail going on. <a href=\"https://x.com/matthewherper/status/1977184954422349846\">Matthew Harper called the situation</a> \u2018chaos,\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/11/cdc-firings-government-shutdown-hhs/\">not normal and unprecedented in his 20 years of reporting</a>.</p>\n<p>Trump seems to be framing this as retaliation for the shutdown because the CDC is a \u2018Democratic\u2019 program, and taking a very \u2018<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tmd-ClpJxA&amp;pp=ygUlbG9vayB3aGF0IHlvdSBtYWRlIG1lIGRvIHRheWxvciBzd2lmdA%3D%3D\">look what you made me do</a>\u2019 attitude?</p>\n<p>Others are pushing back on the theory that the CDC is bad and incompetent, actually, so this is good actually, a line I\u2019ve seen both from MAGA people <a href=\"https://x.com/ohabryka/status/1977212816450109807\">and also some others</a>.</p>\n<p>I have not been especially impressed with the CDC, shall we say, on Covid-19 related fronts or in other places I\u2019ve gotten a close look.

The largest study in the systematic review that the administration cited found no association between prenatal Tylenol use and autism.

Jeremy Giffon suggests looking to see who prefers which, whether they maximize effort or elegance, with \u2018work hard\u2019 people looking to outwork you and \u2018work smart\u2019 people looking for \u2018mate in one\u2019 tactics. I reject the dichotomy. If you \u2018work hard\u2019 because you find value in working hard, and don\u2019t look for the better way before you start working hard, you are confusing costs and benefits. Looking for the right way to optimize results as a function of work, including the planning work, is hard work.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d also note that contra Giffon\u2019s example, Trump in defeating Cruz for the 2016 nomination very much did not \u2018mate in one\u2019 but instead worked very hard, in his way, for quite a while, and pulled off a very complex set of moves, even if he often did not consciously know what he was doing. And that game, like Cruz\u2019s, started decades before the campaign. And in his nightclub example, it\u2019s not obvious which solution (work hard at the gate or work hard to skip the gate) is which.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So Emotional</h4>\n\n\n<p>A standard Darvo strategy is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Gaslight people. Do and say false totally insane awful things. In a calm manner.</li>\n<li>Others react strongly, and in various ways point out what happened.</li>\n<li>Invoke the mellow heuristic, that whoever is more emotional is usually wrong.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.econlib.org/archives/2015/04/the_mellow_heur.html\">The origin of The Mellow Heuristic seems to be, highly appropriately, Bryan Caplan</a>. Bryan is an expert at staying mellow and calm while saying things that are anywhere from contrarian and correct all the way to patently insane.</p>\n<p>The original justification is that \u2018emotion clouds judgment\u2019 which is true but it can also be highly useful, or highly appropriate or typical given facts or circumstances. There are cases where that logic applies but they seem rare, and more often the evidence and causation largely runs the other way. As in, sometimes the emotion isn\u2019t causing poor thinking, the emotion in context is instead evidence of poor thinking, if there\u2019s no other explanation for it, but if the emotion is justified by circumstances I think it provides little or no or even negative evidence.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ohabryka/status/1975817012086792230\">Stefan Schubert</a> (quoting the original Mellow Heuristic post): I think that people who disagree with Mechanize should engage with them with logical arguments, not sarcasm and mockery.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ohabryka/status/1975817012086792230\">Oliver Habryka</a>: The Mellow Heuristic seems pretty terrible to me. My guess is in most historical disputes I\u2019ve been involved in it would get the wrong answer. Pretty close to as uninformative as it gets.</p>\n<p>[is challenged for examples, gives examples, is challenged that the examples are because rationalists perhaps pre-apply too much mellow heuristic, creating selection bias]</p>\n<p>I think the selection bias here is merely the result of needing reference points that can be pointed to. I could tell you \u201cthat time when I adjudicated a work dispute yesterday\u201d but that\u2019s of course useless.</p>\n<p>For lower stakes, my sense is the mellow heuristic is actively anti-correlated. If I have one programmer who has very strong feelings about a topic, and one who doesn\u2019t, the one who has very strong feelings is a decent amount more likely to be right. There is a reason for their feelings!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think, in this particular case (IYKYK), the correct answer is to engage with the actual arguments, but also it seems right to use sarcasm and mockery, because they deserve it and because it is funny, and because it is often the easiest way to point out the underlying illogic of an argument.</p>\n<p>Where the Mellow Heuristic is useful is when the emotion is disproportionate to the situation even if they are telling the truth, or it is clearly so strong it is clouding judgment in ways that hurt their chance of being right, and most importantly when it is being used as itself an argument, an appeal to emotion, in a way that reveals a lack of a more logical argument, in response to something deserving of a counterargument.</p>\n<p>It is least useful in cases like this one where, as I put it in the weekly, that\u2019s bait.</p>\n<p>Although what\u2019s even funnier is, I think if you properly apply the Mellow Heuristic and similar questions to the Mechanize case, it does not go well for Mechanize, such as here where they respond to Bernie Sanders saying that Mechanize aims to \u2018make it easier to pay workers less\u2019 <a href=\"https://x.com/MechanizeWork/status/1975375323002020338\">by claiming that they pay their employees vastly more than Bernie Sanders pays his staffers</a>, which (1) is a highly emotional-style claim, (2) which is clearly designed to rile other people up, and (3) is completely irrelevant given the difference in role types.</p>\n<p>Again, this is Emergent Misalignment, saying the awful thing because it is awful. It\u2019s play acting at being a villain, because you woke up and realized you didn\u2019t die the hero.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where Credit Is Due</h4>\n\n\n<p>Credit scores, I say with love, are one of our most valuable inventions.</p>\n<p>The math behind credit scores is, and this too I say with love, deeply stupid.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rachel, Spirited Sparrow: My husband\u2019s credit score was 841. He made a final payment on our vehicle and it immediately dropped to 795. Never missed a payment. But they want you to carry debt.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/EigenGender/status/1976194150036013474\">EigenGender</a>: It\u2019s kinda funny that some analyst probably ran a bad linear regression decades ago and it fuels constant conspiracy theories on here.</p>\n<p>Jai: Currently making payments predicts paying back further loans. Not currently doing that weakly predicts disengagement. I think the math is sound and fits reality &#8211; they do want you to carry debt to prove that you\u2019re still the kind of person who pays back loans on time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There\u2019s no mystery what is going on here. Having long duration open credit accounts that you\u2019ve been consistently paying absolutely predicts future repayments. Credit scores also take into account various other correlates, to the extent they are legal to take into account, and excludes the ones that aren\u2019t legal to take into account.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all very Level 1 thinking, squarely in the territory of Goodhart\u2019s Law and riddled with obvious mistakes. The measures would be strictly better if they looked backwards in a sensible fashion and included length of paid off loans inside average age of loans, and otherwise take into account what evidence there actually is that you\u2019ll pay your debts on time, and ideally do some Level 2 (or even Level 3) thinking, but those involved aren\u2019t that clever, so they don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Perhaps some expert will chime in and say no, we ran the backtests and that doesn\u2019t actually help, to which I reply that is a Skill Issue, you did it wrong, try again.</p>\n<p>The alternative hypothesis is that \u2018they want you to carry debt\u2019 is literal.</p>\n<p>The resulting scores are still highly useful, and still mostly \u2018get it right,\u2019 partly because most of the time obvious answer is right and in part because if you have the discipline to work to raise your credit score, that is strong evidence of good credit.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Good News, Everyone</h4>\n\n\n<p>TIL <a href=\"https://x.com/SinaHartung/status/1966328658483957923\">you can type docs.new or sheets.new into your browser and get a new doc or sheet</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/eshear/status/1968945242825990145\">the fun fact I learned that Italian has two words for regret</a>, \u2018rimorsi\u2019 for something you did and wish you didn\u2019t, and \u2018rimpianti\u2019 for something you didn\u2019t do and wish you did.

I agree. Yes, we should turn as many places as possible into Manhattans, which would then make them all much better than Manhattan because housing costs would go down.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/david_perell/status/1973927845387792391\">David Perell in praise of New York.</a> Mostly this also seems right, especially the secondary note about New York having multiple core industries (and I\u2019d add cultures and worlds) and this making things far less transactional than San Francisco despite New York having the finance world, because the status hierarchies are parallel and also you don\u2019t constantly have business interests with everyone.</p>\n<p>The only place that felt wrong to me is he says people in New York are flakey due to excess of options, but I haven\u2019t experienced that, and find people in San Francisco far more flakey even when they are literally the same people.</p>\n<p>I agree that transportation to and from the airports is one of the biggest obvious failures, although it\u2019s ultimately a minor cost compared to rent even if you use taxis end to end. I am stubborn and mostly take the subway to and from JFK despite everything (and the train to EWR as well), but it\u2019s certainly not fast and if I ever was using LGA that wouldn\u2019t work.</p>\n<p>I also agree that friendships can be difficult and won\u2019t become close by accident. The city is too large, you will meet lots of people but you have to actively make real friendships happen after that initial step.</p>\n<p>As he notes, the Duane Reeds and Best Buys of New York have locked up remarkably many goods, and this is super annoying on occasion. In some ways I agree it reflects loss of social trust, but mostly I think it reflects a narrow failure to enforce the shoplifting laws in an otherwise high trust society. As in, I feel exceedingly safe and like I can relax, but It Is Known that if you shoplift you basically get away with it, so in certain spots they have to play defense to avoid being the juiciest target.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/david_perell/status/1974523246600180219\">David Perell:</a> The ideal distance to live away from your best friends is Walkie-Talkie distance: close enough where you can easily walk to each other\u2019s place but far enough away so everyone has some space. And if you get enough friends in the neighborhood, it starts to feel like college again.</p>\n<p>Michael Miraflor: This is what NYC feels like when you\u2019re young and just out of school and working at an office where people generally live a short train ride away. The city is small, your friends are close, and the city is a museum, playground, and source of inspiration wrapped into one.</p>\n<p>The office part matters imo. You can meet your best friends or your partner at your first office job. To be young and working hard in the trenches together and also celebrating and making real friendships IRL is an important part of it all &#8211; professional camaraderie, personal development, how to function in the world, etc, and a lot of it has been wrecked a bit by WFH.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Alas, most of us are not young anymore, but yes everything being at your fingertips is the big secret weapon, both walking and via subways. You do still have to put in the effort if you want the friendships to be real.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/the-bay-area-is-cursed?triedRedirect=true\">Sasha praises New York City by contrast with the Bay Area</a>, which he refers to as cursed because everything must have purpose and beauty and grace are frowned upon. Really this is 5% praising New York and 95% absolutely unloading on San Francisco, or rather than San Francisco that reads this blog and is full of technology. The post is a joy to read purely for the experience of reading, even if you disagree with all of it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sasha Chapin: In the Bay, beauty (personal and otherwise) is looked down on and the famous gender imbalance has chilling effects. Is there a less sexual city than this? Perhaps Salt Lake, but I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s close. My gorgeous friend M is self-conscious about wearing pretty dresses, which is insane anywhere else, but reasonable here: hotness is a quality people aren\u2019t sure what to do with.</p>\n<p>Recently there was a themed Gender Ratio party where beautiful young women dressed glamorously, at least one for every man. In other cities this would be referred to as a party.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Sasha Chapin (from the comments): I lived in LA for a couple of years and deeply love it.

If they\u2019re similar or lower, great job.</p>\n<p>There are two catches.</p>\n<p>The first catch is that the scalper price is \u2018not your fault,\u2019 whereas the venue price is considered your fault. So you gain goodwill by charging less, even though this is dumb. This could be more valuable than the extra revenue and easier access to tickets that you get the other way? Maybe.</p>\n<p>The other catch is that you often have preferences over distribution of tickets, and who attends your sold out show, that do not entirely match willingness to pay.</p>\n<p>Another strong piece of evidence that prices are too low is that often people will spend lots of time and money to get to a concert, vastly in excess of the ticket price.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been to three concerts recently, and have realized I don\u2019t do this enough but that selection and preparation are crucial. You want to not miss the good opportunities, or within reason pass on them due to price, but also the mediocre opportunities are meh.</p>\n<p>The first was Weird Al Yankovic at Madison Square Garden, very much a \u2018play the hits\u2019 show and every inch a Weird Al Yankovic show, including S-tier use of the multimedia screens throughout. It was great fun and I was very happy I got a chance to see him, but at the same time I couldn\u2019t actually see him in a meaningful way and I was mostly watching those screens, and the opening act of Puddles Pity Party was appropriate and did some interesting things but wasn\u2019t ultimately my cup of tea.</p>\n<p>The second was The Who, in their The Song Is Over tour, also at Madison Square Garden, with Feist as the opening act. A big problem was that with this amount of rocking out I was unable to hear the lyrics of either band well enough to understand them if I didn\u2019t already know what they were. The majority of the time this wasn\u2019t a problem for The Who, but for Feist it was extremely frustrating as I only knew the one song, so while they seemed great effectively everything else didn\u2019t have lyrics. And you could feel every time they talked how much these guys appreciated and loved their jobs and their fans, and that they were pushing to do this until they physically couldn\u2019t anymore.</p>\n<p>The third was Garbage at The Brooklyn Paramount, which was standing room general admission, where the doors open at 7pm, opening act Starcrawler went on at 8pm, and Garbage only went on at 9pm, but not knowing this we showed up just before 7pm. Which despite a ton of waiting was ultimately a great decision, because by making a beeline to the stage, we got to be only about five effective rows deep. And that made a night and day difference. Starcrawler was effectively a (very strong) dancing performance by the lead singer since I couldn\u2019t make out any lyrics at all, but we were close enough to appreciate it.</p>\n<p>And then we got to see Garbage up close and that was fantastic, including being able to fully take in the joy on Shirley\u2019s face as she turned the microphone towards the crowd. Find something you love as much as she loves the crowd singing her greatest hits, which resonated a lot with me based on how I feel when I see people citing my classic posts, except of course her version is way cooler. And even the new-to-me more recent stuff was great.</p>\n<p>My overall conclusion is that yes, live music is Worth It, even if you\u2019re somewhat old and busted and it requires a babysitter and so on, if and only if you do it right. And what doing it right means is (not that any of this is new or special, but I want to remember for the future and remind others):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Show up for artists you resonate with.</li>\n<li>Do your homework. Know most of the songs cold. Ideally including the warmup.</li>\n<li>Pay up, in time or money, to get actually good seats if at all possible, and prioritize smaller venues to help do this.</li>\n<li>Have a plan for the downtime.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My plan is, of course, to set up an AI to periodically check for opportunities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/fasc1nate/status/1968918030945001600\">A chart of which movies men and women rate relatively highly on IMDB</a>:</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YW92!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe149a867-4dc6-4868-9d64-db5561c5d2b1_845x995.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>The patterns here are rather obvious.

If women actually think Despicable Me is the #145 best movie here, or The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is #83, I\u2019m sorry ladies, you\u2019re crazy, and honestly with Catching Fire no one involved has an excuse either way. And aside from Wonder Woman where this opinion is simply wrong, that movie was not good, the other half of that first list I find a highly acceptable expression of different preferences.</p>\n<p>The male list definitely seems very male.

As usual, his evaluations are almost always correct in an abstract Quality sense, but that\u2019s not that big a portion of what I care about. This time around I have seen at most two of them.</p>\n<p>I bought into A Big Bold Beautiful Journey (4.5/5 stars) and he didn\u2019t, and I agree that the later scenes rely on somewhat unearned emotion, so I get his only giving out a 2.9, that seems like a reasonable \u2018didn\u2019t work for me\u2019 rating here. The other one I think I saw was The Last Days of Disco, he gives it 3.6 but I don\u2019t remember it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/robinhanson/status/1972095603510251977\">Robin Hanson reviews One Battle After Another</a> and correctly identifies what you see if you take the movie at face value. You can of course respond \u2018this is Paul Thomas Anderson and based on Pynchon\u2019s Vineyard and obviously not intended that way,\u2019 and one can debate how relevant that fact is here, as well.</p>\n<p>I did not like One Battle After Another, reluctantly giving it 3/5. The critical reaction being this positive, and seeing rave after rave, made me angry. I stand by that on reflection. The Quality level isn\u2019t bad, but I think everyone thinks it is way higher Quality than it actually is, and most importantly even if you can look past the other stuff I hated you have to buy into the idea that Bob (Leo\u2019s character) is sympathetic despite being among other things a completely unrepentant terrorist bomber, or the movie simply doesn\u2019t work. I couldn\u2019t do it.</p>\n<p>Critics think we\u2019re both wrong, and gave it a Metacritic 95, but audiences aren\u2019t much biting, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-10-09/north-korea-s-military-is-more-advanced-than-you-think\">only giving it $22.4 million on opening weekend on a $200 million budget</a>, so it almost has to win Best Picture to hope to break even. Film critic Jason Bailey says this is fine, they did it for the prestige and to mend relations with talent, they shouldn\u2019t have to make money. Nice work if you can get it?</p>\n<p>I do admit that the whole thing showed strong faith in and willingness to spend on talent for a three hour, R-rated \u2018explosive political thriller\u2019 from Paul Thomas Anderson, whose movies are consistently liked but whose box office record is spotty. That the critics think the movie is so political, and this makes them like it even more, helps explain why I like it less.</p>\n<p>As for the rest of the movie reviews, as always <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/thezvi/reviews/\">you can find them on Letterboxd</a>, where I make a point of reviewing everything I see no matter what, and I\u2019ll have an end of year post.

Yes, it turns out that pushing GPUs harder led to LLMs, and you can view that outcome as more important (for good and bad) than the games, but that\u2019s not why they did it.

Self-driving cars are so amazingly great that I consider preventing most car accidents a secondary benefit versus the lifestyle and mobility benefits. And yet support is perilous:</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IOp3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22763b02-19f8-49d2-b6b8-7e24f5ad0d72_1121x541.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>What\u2019s craziest is that those over 65 want to ban self-driving cars. They stand to benefit the most, because they will soon be unable to drive. Self-driving equals freedom. Or perhaps what\u2019s craziest is that people\u2019s main objection is safety and trust, here is what people say to justify a ban and it isn\u2019t jobs:</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Av6X!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42ead12c-21ee-4f2c-9277-05c5c826e217_1104x639.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>These concerns clearly have nothing to do with the actual safety data, which presumably most people don\u2019t know.</p>\n<p>So I largely take back not wanting to primarily make the case in terms of safety, because people genuinely don\u2019t understand that Waymos are vastly safer than human drivers. If we make the safety case, then people\u2019s bigger objections go away. Except the whole \u2018I hate AI\u2019 objection, I guess.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/FedericoNoemie/status/1968014985113768078\">Waymo is testing at SFO. Woo-hoo</a>! Even if they can\u2019t go to the East Bay directly yet I would totally have them drive me to the last Bart station and go from there.</p>\n<p>Exposure makes the public like Waymo, <a href=\"https://sfstandard.com/2025/10/08/san-francisco-became-waymo-pilled/\">with two thirds of San Francisco now approving</a>, a major shift from two years ago. This is despite only 30% realizing that Waymos are safer than human drivers.</p>\n<p>How much safer are they? A lot. <a href=\"https://x.com/ethanteicher/status/1967980602965246145\">We got 96 million new miles of Waymo safety data.</a></p>\n<p>Not only are Waymos involved in vastly fewer serious crashes and injuries than human driven cars, as in 79% less airbag crashes and 91% fewer serious injuries over what is now a very large sample size, including very similar numbers on harm to pedestrians and bike riders.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.understandingai.org/p/very-few-of-waymos-most-serious-crashes\">Very few of Waymo\u2019s most serious crashes were Waymos\u2019s fault</a>. In a majority of the major accidents the Waymo was not even moving. We can determine this because Waymos are full of cameras, so Kai Williams did exactly this. He could not find a single accident that was the fault of the self-driving itself, and 37 out of 41 were mostly or completely the fault of other drivers. The most serious accident where a Waymo was actually at fault involved the front left wheel literally detaching.</p>\n<p>This suggests that if we replaced all cars with Waymos, we would get vastly more than a 79% reduction in crashes and injuries. We would get more like a 95%+ reduction.</p>\n<p>As I said last month, I prefer not to rely on safety as the central argument, but the safety case is overwhelming. However, it is 2025, so you can just say things, and often people do. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/VitalCityNYC/status/1968715565876330799\">Vital City NYC:</a> This morning, the New York Editorial Board interviewed Bill de Blasio. In light of his history with Uber, the group asked what the city\u2019s posture should be toward Waymo. He said: \u201cThe driverless cars are a public safety danger period.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The public safety danger is that there is the danger they might create public safety?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/TheStalwart/status/1968307127551955176\">Joe Weisenthal (who to be clear loves Waymo) worries we aren\u2019t ready for cars</a> to turn from a symbol of freedom to another thing run by Big Cloud. I\u2019m not worried. It will take a while before there is any danger to \u2018if you like your car you can keep your car\u2019 or your ability to buy a new one, if you want that. For many of us, the symbol of practical freedom, and also the actual freedom, is the ability to call upon the cloud and get moved around at will.</p>\n<p>This is distinct from the \u2018what I can do if the authorities or others with power are Out To Get Me\u2019 type of freedom. Yes I do think there will be some loss there and impact on the psyche, but almost no one wants to pay the cost to keep that. A lot of things are going to change because of AI, whether or not we are ready, and the old thing here was not going to get preserved for so many reasons.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/dylanmatt/status/1971288144793534812\">Mothers Against Drunk Driving is strongly in favor of autonomous vehicles</a>, as one would expect given their name.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sports Go Sports</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/OllieConnolly/status/1974533791671833006\">How did Bill Belichick\u2019s coaching stint at UNC go so perfectly terribly</a>?

Whoops. I\u2019m sad for the kids that got filtered into the wrong tier, but they did choose to play for Bill Belichick, UNC is otherwise a nice school and they are getting paid. The players will be fine.</p>\n<p>Kicker quality keeps increasing and field goal range keeps expanding in the NFL. <a href=\"https://x.com/NateSilver538/status/1977765235860574548\">This has a number of downstream effects</a>. If even modest field position gives you 3 points, but you don\u2019t that often get the full 7, this is going to create a lot of risk aversion.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Derek Thompson: interesting that strategic optimization has pushed basketball and football in opposite directions: long shots vs. short passes</p>\n<p>NFL in 2025 has:</p>\n<p>&#8211; highest QB completion % ever</p>\n<p>&#8211; lowest INT% ever</p>\n<p>&#8211; fewest yards/catch ever</p>\n<p>&#8211; and, sort of a separate thing, but: most long field goal attempts ever</p>\n<p>fewest punts per game ever, too!</p>\n<p>Nate Silver: The field goals thing is sort of related to it. If you\u2019re anywhere past the opponents\u2019 45-yard line or so, it\u2019s riskier to gamble with downfield passes that may result in an INT because the expected value of the possession is higher when you\u2019re almost assured of a FG.</p>\n<p>And really, these considerations apply even before then. With teams also starting out with better field position with the new kickoff rules, they\u2019re often in a position where two first downs = field goal range. Don\u2019t love it, don\u2019t hate it, but it\u2019s definitely different.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I primarily watch college football these days, but I\u2019m pretty sure that in the NFL this has gone too far. You shouldn\u2019t spend this big a percentage of the time in confident field goal range, as it reduces the number of interesting decisions and distinctions between situations, and causes too much risk aversion. The NFL over the years assembled a bunch of moving parts into something that seemed \u2018natural and dynamic\u2019 in various ways, and it feels like various changes are moving it to feel more arbitrary and flow less well and also reduce variety.</p>\n<p>What should we do about it?</p>\n<p>I would start with changing kickoffs back to a default or average of about the 20 yard line, and if you don\u2019t know how to do them safely without them looking bizarre and playing badly, why not just get rid of them and start the ball on the 20, or the option to start on your own 20 with a 4th and [X], for whatever [X] makes sense (maybe only if you\u2019re behind in the second half?), as an onside kick alternative? You don\u2019t actually need a kickoff. Or you could even just start with 4th and 15 all the time from e.g. your own 40, you\u2019re not allowed to attempt a FG unless you make at least one first down, and by default you just punt, since punts don\u2019t require this whole distinct logic and seem safe enough.</p>\n<p>Then we need to do something about the kickers. I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s bad for the game if 50+ yard field goals are reliable. If we can\u2019t think of anything else, narrow and raise the uprights or even move them further back until it\u2019s hard enough again (and adjust the extra point yard line to the desired difficulty level).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/jbarro/status/1974120333079949807\">Americans increasingly see legal sports betting as a bad thing for society and sports</a>. I share Josh Barro\u2019s expectation that this will become a campaign issue, if AI doesn\u2019t overwhelm all other issues. As he notes, the Federal government can still ban it, if they\u2019re willing to pull the trigger in full. I don\u2019t think a full ban is the first best solution here, but if it is this for DraftKings and FanDuel, it\u2019s an upgrade. If the future ends up being prediction markets with lots of liquidity at great prices and no discrimination against winners? That\u2019s way better.
