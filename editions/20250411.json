The new paper <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18813\">Defeating Prompt Injections by Design</a></strong> from Google DeepMind <em>finally</em> bucks that trend. This one is worth paying attention to.</p> <p>If you're new to prompt injection attacks the very short version is this: what happens if someone emails my LLM-driven assistant (or \"agent\" if you like) and tells it to forward all of my emails to a third party? Here's <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/25/dual-llm-pattern/\">an extended explanation</a> of why it's so hard to prevent this from being a show-stopping security issue which threatens the dream digital assistants that everyone is trying to build.</p> <p>The original sin of LLMs that makes them vulnerable to this is when trusted prompts from the user and untrusted text from emails/web pages/etc are concatenated together into the same token stream. I called it \"prompt injection\" because it's the same anti-pattern as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection\">SQL injection</a>.</p> <p>Sadly, there is no known reliable way to have an LLM follow instructions in one category of text while safely applying those instructions to another category of text.</p> <p>That's where <strong>CaMeL</strong> comes in.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18813\">new",

But different British people disagree on how they should be governed, and sometimes one or another faction gets more power, so the government sometimes flip-flops about what it wants.</p><p>The purpose of the New York bus system is to transport New Yorkers. The carbon emissions are an unintended side effect..</p><p>Am I being unfair here? Maybe the slogan &#8220;the purpose of a system is what it does&#8221; was never meant to apply to situations like these?</p><p>But then what <em>was</em> it meant to apply to? Nobody uses the phrase in cases where it&#8217;s obviously true - for example, nobody says &#8220;The purpose of a system is what it does! Therefore, you must believe that the purpose of airlines is to transport people using planes!&#8221; It&#8217;s only used for galaxy-brained claims like &#8220;The purpose of a system is what it does! The police do a bad job solving crime, therefore <em>the purpose of the police</em> <em>must be to tolerate crime</em>, no matter what you gullible starry-eyed idealists who take the police&#8217;s story at face value might think!&#8221;</p><p>Here the correct response is that the police might try to solve crime, but fail - just as the Ukrainian military tries to win wars and fails, or a cancer hospital tries to cure every patient but sometimes fails. Given that this is not just possible but in fact incredibly common, what is left of the phrase &#8220;the purpose of a system is what it does&#8221;?</p><p>Or someone might say &#8220;The police sometimes brutally beat suspects. Therefore, the purpose of the police is to control and intimidate the population by brutally beating them. You can&#8217;t claim that this is just a mistake or a side effect - the purpose of a system is what it does!&#8221;</p><p>Here the correct response is that you can absolutely claim it is an unfortunate side effect, just as emitting billions of tons of carbon dioxide is an unfortunate side effect of the New York bus system.</p><p>Maybe I&#8217;m still missing some genuinely good and useful insight that POSIWID can be used for? I searched the phrase on X/Twitter to see how people were using it in the wild&#8230;</p><p>&#8230;and by far the most common category is just people praising the phrase as a great insight, with no application in mind at all. &#8220;Did you know the purpose of a system is what it does?
