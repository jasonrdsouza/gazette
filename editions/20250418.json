This new segmentation mask feature represents a significant new capability!</p> <p>Here's my new tool to try it out: <strong><a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/gemini-mask\">Gemini API Image Mask Visualization</a></strong>. As with my bounding box tool it's browser-based JavaScript that talks to the Gemini API directly. You provide it with a <a href=\"https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey\">Gemini API key</a> which isn't logged anywhere that I can see it.</p> <p>This is what it can do:</p> <p><img alt=\"Screenshot of mask tool.
