It looks up\nthe value among the environmental variables, with fallback. Because the value <em>can</em> be specified at\nruntime, compiler can\u2019t optimize assuming a particular constant. And you also get a convenient way\nto re-run benchmark with a different set of parameters without recompiling.</p>\n<p>On the output side, we compute an (extremely weak) \u201chash\u201d of the results. For our binary search \u2014\njust the sum of all the indexes. Then we print this hash together with the timing information.\nBecause we use the results of our computation, compiler can\u2019t optimize them away!</p>\n<p>Similarly to the <code>parameter</code> function, we also get a bonus feature for free. You know who also\n<em>loves</em> making code faster by deleting \u201cunnecessary\u201d functionality? I do! Though I am not as smart\nas a compiler, and usually end up deleting code that actually <em>is</em> required to get the right answer.\nWith the hash, if I mess my optimization work to the point of getting a wrong answer, I\n<em>immediately</em> see that reflected in an unexpected value of the hash.</p>\n<p>Consider avoiding black boxes for your next benchmark. Instead, stick to natural\nanti-optimizing-compiler remedies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nMake input parameters runtime overridable (with compile time defaults),\n</li>\n<li>\nprint the result (or the hash thereof).\n</li>\n</ul>\n</section>"

Meta offers <a href=\"https://x.com/unblogd/status/1997350980648567073\">the very same paid verification scheme</a> as X but, <a href=\"https://www.piratewires.com/p/european-commission-x-investigation-blue-check\">according to Musk</a>, has chosen to play ball with the EU censorship apparatus, so no investigation for them. And the citizens of Europe clearly don't seem bothered much by any \"deceptive design\", as X continues to be <a href=\"https://x.com/cb_doge/status/1997712813746426124?s=20\">a top-ranked download across every country</a> on the continent.</div><div><br />But you can see why many politicians in Europe are eager to punish X for giving Europeans a social media that doesn't cooperate with its crackdown on wrongthink. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is personally responsible for <a href=\"https://archive.md/EwYHV\">5,000(!!) cases pursuing his subjects for insults online</a>, which has led to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bMzFDpfDwc\">house raids</a> for utterances as banal as calling him a \"filthy drunk\".</div><div><br />Germany is not an outlier either. The <a href=\"https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/select-communications-offences-and-concerns-over-free-speech/\">UK has been arresting over 10,000 people per year since 2020</a> for illicit tweets, Facebook posts, and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g9kp7r00vo\">silent prayers</a>. France has thousands of yearly cases for speech-related offenses too. No wonder people on X aren't eager to volunteer their name and address when <a href=\"https://x.com/HBrandstaetter/status/1997352649788657997\">their elected officials crash out over their tweets</a>.</div><div><br />It's against this backdrop \u2014 thousands of yearly arrests for banal insults or crass opposition to government policies \u2014 that some Europeans still try to <a href=\"https://x.com/romanhelmetguy/status/1997864076970778687?s=20\">convince themselves</a> they're the true champions of free speech and <a href=\"https://x.com/AndreasAasheim/status/1997761221328834653\">freedom of the press</a>. Delulu indeed.&nbsp;<br /><br /></div><div>But this isn't just about the lack of free speech in Europe. The X fine also highlights just how weak and puny the European tech sector has become. Get this: <a href=\"https://x.com/da_fant/status/1998090511807381613?s=20\">The EU's tech-fine operation produced more income for European coffers than all the income taxes paid by its public internet tech companies in 2024</a>!!</div><div><br />That's primarily because Europe basically stopped creating new, large companies more than half a century ago. So as the likes of Nokia died off, there was nobody new to replace them. In the last fifty years, the number and size of new European companies worth $10 billion or more is alarmingly small:<br /><br />  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--jpeg\">\n      <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/8b10e7cb/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjM3MjQ2NTQ0MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ--aa0ea14b83851d218e68fa686bae6c83b2efe673b6368c5e4a35cbc6e0e4c124/us-v-eu-bubbles.jpeg?disposition=attachment\" title=\"Download us-v-eu-bubbles.jpeg\">\n        <img alt=\"us-v-eu-bubbles.jpeg\" src=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/8b10e7cb/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjM3MjQ2NTQ0MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ--aa0ea14b83851d218e68fa686bae6c83b2efe673b6368c5e4a35cbc6e0e4c124/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6eyJmb3JtYXQiOiJqcGVnIiwicmVzaXplX3RvX2xpbWl0IjpbMzg0MCwyNTYwXSwicXVhbGl0eSI6NjAsImxvYWRlciI6eyJwYWdlIjpudWxsfSwiY29hbGVzY2UiOnRydWV9LCJwdXIiOiJ2YXJpYXRpb24ifX0--86fa621099aa99aa0c7ae156d97d21b387d30fa6ac57aa5c89948af503464a06/us-v-eu-bubbles.jpeg\" />\n</a>\n  </figure></div><div><br />But even the old industrial titans of Europe are now struggling. <a href=\"https://economy-finance.ec.europa.eu/economic-surveillance-eu-member-states/country-pages/germany/economic-forecast-germany_en#:~:text=Germany%20has%20gone%20through%20a,the%20first%20half%20of%202025.\">Germany hasn't grown its real GDP in five years</a>.

That America would spend so much on its military might. Since the invasion of Ukraine, there's been a lot less laughing, and now the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/nato-leaders-set-back-trump-defence-spending-goal-hague-summit-2025-06-24/\">new official NATO target</a> for member states is to spend 5% of GDP on defense.<br /><br /></div><div>But even this target fails to acknowledge the fact that even if European countries should meet their new obligations (and currently only Poland among the larger EU countries is even close), they'd still lag far behind America, simply because the EU is comparatively a much smaller and shrinking economic zone.&nbsp;<br /><br /></div><div>In 2025, the combined GDP for the European Union was $20 trillion. America was <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/?locations=EU-US\"><em>fifty percent larger</em></a> with a GDP of $30 trillion. And the gap continues to widen, as EU growth is pegged at around 1% in 2024 compared to almost 3% for the US.</div><div><br />Now this is usually when the euro cope begins to screech the loudest. Trying every which way to explain that actually Europe is a better place to live than America, despite having a <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/01/03/the-poorest-us-state-rivals-germany-gdp-per-capita-in-the-us-and-europe\">GDP per capita</a> that's almost half.&nbsp;<br /><br /></div><div>And on a subjective level, that might well be true! There are plenty of reasons to prefer living in Europe, but that doesn't offset the fact that America is simply a vastly richer country, and that matters when it comes to everything from commercial dominance to military power.<br /><br /></div><div>But it's the trajectory that's most damning. In 2008, <a href=\"https://econofact.org/factbrief/fact-check-has-the-economic-gap-between-europe-and-the-united-states-increased-in-the-past-decade\">Europe was on near-parity in GDP with America</a>! But if the 1% vs 3% growth-rate disparity continues for another decade, America will grow its economy by another third to $40 trillion, while Europe will grow just 10% to $22 trillion. Making the American economy nearly twice as large as the European one. Yikes.<br /><br /></div><div>These should all be sobering numbers to any European. Whether it's the 10,000 yearly arrests in the UK for social media posts or the risk of an economy that's half the size of the American one in a decade.&nbsp;<br /><br /></div><div>But Europe isn't doomed to fulfill this tragic destiny. It's full of some of the most creative, capable, and ambitious people in the world (like the fifth of US startup unicorns with European founders!). But they need much better reasons to stay than what the EU (and now a separate UK) is currently giving them.<br /><br /></div><div>Like drastically lower energy costs to for a competitive industrial base and to power the AI revolution, so best we quickly revive European nuclear ambitions. Like an immigration policy designed to rival America's cherry-picking of the world's best, rather than mass immigration from <a href=\"https://www.iq-international-test.com/en/test/IQ_by_country\">low-average-IQ regions</a> of <a href=\"https://x.com/jonatanpallesen/status/1845525384407953560?s=20\">net-negative contributors</a> to the economy (and society). Like dropping the censorship ambitions and bureaucratic boondoggles like the DSA. Like actually offering a European internal market for remote labor and a unified stock exchange for listings.<br /><br /></div><div>There are plenty of paths to take that do not end in a low-growth, censorious regime that continues to export many of its best brains to America and elsewhere.

President Xi responded positively! $25% will be paid to the United States of America. This policy will support American Jobs, strengthen U.S. Manufacturing, and benefit American Taxpayers. The Biden Administration forced our Great Companies to spend BILLIONS OF DOLLARS building \u201cdegraded\u201d products that nobody wanted, a terrible idea that slowed Innovation, and hurt the American Worker. That Era is OVER! We will protect National Security, create American Jobs, and keep America\u2019s lead in AI. NVIDIA\u2019s U.S. Customers are already moving forward with their incredible, highly advanced Blackwell chips, and soon, Rubin, neither of which are part of this deal. My Administration will always put America FIRST. The Department of Commerce is finalizing the details, and the same approach will apply to AMD, Intel, and other GREAT American Companies. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/peterwildeford/status/1998405904677367912\">Peter Wildeford</a>: I wonder what the \u201cconditions that allow for continued strong National Security\u201d will be. Seems important!</p></blockquote>\n<p>The \u2018conditions that allow\u2019 clause could be our out to at least mitigate the damage here, since no these sales would not allow for continued strong national security.</p>\n<p>I believe this would, if it was carried out at scale without big national security conditions attached, be extremely damaging to American national interests and national security and our ability to \u2018beat China\u2019 in any meaningful sense, in addition to any impacts it would have on AI safety and our ability to navigate and survive the transition to superintelligence.</p>\n<p>This is happening despite strong opposition from Congress, what looks like opposition from most of those in the executive branch, deep unpopularity among experts and the entire policy community and the strong advice of America\u2019s strongest AI champions on the software side, and unpopularity with the public. The vibes are almost entirely \u2018this is a terrible decision, what are we even doing.\u2019</p>\n<p>The only ways I can think of for this to be a non-terrible idea are either if the Chinese somehow refuse the chips in which case it will do little harm but also little good, or (and to be fully clear on this possibility: I have zero reason to believe this to be the case) that H200s have some sort of secret remote control or backdoor.</p>\n<p>I presume this decision comes from a failure by Trump to appreciate the strategic importance, power and cost efficiency of the H200 chips, combined with aggressive pushing of this from those including David Sacks who have repeatedly put private industry interests, especially those of Nvidia, above the interests of America.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Bad Would This Be?</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/AlecStapp/status/1998142908080517131\">Alec Stapp (IFP)</a>: Massive own goal to export these AI chips to China.</p>\n<p>The H200 is 6x more powerful than the H20, which was previously the most powerful chip approved for export.</p>\n<p>Our compute advantage is the main thing keeping us ahead of China in AI.</p>\n<p>Why would we throw that away?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ChrisRMcGuire/status/1998147358912393552\">Chris McGuire</a> (Council on Foreign Relations): This is the single biggest change in U.S.-China policy of the entire Administration, signaling a reversion to the cooperative policies of the 2000s and early 2010s and away from the competitive policies of Trump 1 and Biden.</p>\n<p>It is a transformational moment for U.S. technology policy, which until now had been predicated on investing at home while holding China back.</p>\n<p>Now we are trying to win a race against a competitor who doesn\u2019t play by the rules.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ChrisRMcGuire/status/1998107284329656633\">Chris McGuire:</a> This is a seachange in U.S. policy, and a significant strategic mistake. If the United States sells AI chips to China that are 18 months behind the frontier, it negates the biggest U.S. advantage over China in AI. Here are four reasons that this new policy helps China much more than it helps the United States:</p>\n<p>1&#x20e3;No Chinese AI chip firm poses a strategic threat to Nvidia or any other U.S firm. China does not plan to make a chip better than the H200 until Q4 2027 at the earliest. It also is severely constrained in the number of lower-quality chips it can make. And China will continue to do everything in its power to reduce its dependency on US AI chips, even while it retains access to US chips.</p>\n<p>2&#x20e3;Because the U.S. lead over China in AI chips is rapidly increasing, a fixed 18 month delay will be even more beneficial to China in the coming months and years. It means the United States could start to sell Blackwell chips to China as soon as the middle of next year &#8211; despite the fact that no Chinese firm has plans to make a chip as good as the GB200 any time this decade. And Rubin chips &#8211; which are projected to be 28x (!) better than U.S. export control thresholds later in President Trump\u2019s term.</p>\n<p>3&#x20e3; Exporting large numbers of AI chips to China will provide an enormous increase to China\u2019s aggregate AI compute capabilities; the quantity of chips that are approved will be key. Large quantity exports will also allow China to compete with U.S. firms in AI infrastructure construction globally &#8211; including with \u201cgood enough\u201d AI data centers that use previous-generation technology but are subsidized by the Chinese government and cheaper than U.S. offerings. Right now China cannot offer any product that can compete globally with U.S. data centers. That is about to change.</p>\n<p>4&#x20e3; We got nothing in exchange for this. This is a massive concession to China, reversing the most significant U.S. technology protection policy vis-a-vis China that has ever been implemented and China\u2019s second most significant criticism of U.S. policy, behind only U.S. support for Taiwan. But the way reporting frames it, this is a unilateral U.S. concession. If the tables were turned, China would not give the United States H200s &#8211; and if they did, they certainly wouldn\u2019t give it to us for free.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/peterwildeford/status/1998409802540835118\">Peter Wildeford</a>: <img alt=\"\ud83d\udcaf\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f4af.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" />on these notes on selling <img alt=\"\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f1e8-1f1f3.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /> the H200 chip&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8211; gives <img alt=\"\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f1e8-1f1f3.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /> access to chips ~2 years ahead of what they can make</p>\n<p>&#8211; doesn\u2019t slow down <img alt=\"\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f1e8-1f1f3.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /> development much</p>\n<p>&#8211; if we allow large quantities of exports, it\u2019s all China needs to compete with US AI + cloud</p>\n<p>&#8211; <img alt=\"\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f1fa-1f1f8.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /> gets nothing in return?

Even when it does this, it will have very little manufacturing capacity.</li>\n<li>H200s would allow Chinese AI supercomputers at roughly +50% cost for training and +100%-500% for inference, compared to Americans with Blackwells.</li>\n<li>China\u2019s manufacturing capabilities and timeline will be entirely unaffected by these exports, because they will proceed at maximum speed either way. This is a matter of national security for them and their domestic market is gigantic.</li>\n<li>Every chip we export is a chip that would have gone to America instead.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That last point is important.

At some point you don\u2019t sell your rival ammunition.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ConservaWonk/status/1998209365447229522\">The default attempted steelman</a> is that this locks China into Nvidia and CUDA and makes them dependent on American chips, or hurts their manufacturing efforts.</p>\n<p>Except this simply is not true.

Not that those things don\u2019t matter, but the concessions available matter far less than the stakes in AI.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Compute Is A Key Limiting Factor For China and Chinese Labs</h4>\n\n\n<p>In particular, compute is a key limiting factor for DeepSeek.</p>\n<p>DeepSeek has made this clear many times over the past two years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/deepseek-v32-is-okay-and-cheap-but\"><strong>DeepSeek recently came out with v3.2</strong></a>. Their paper makes clear that this could have been a far more capable model if they had access to more compute, and they could be serving the model far faster. DeepSeek\u2019s training runs have, by all reports, repeatedly run into trouble because of lack of compute and attempts to use Huawei chips.</p>\n<p>This extends to the rest of the Chinese model ecosystem. China specializes in creating and using models that are cheap to train and cheap to use, partly because that is the niche for fast followers, and also largely because they do not have the compute to do otherwise.</p>\n<p>If we gave the Chinese AI ecosystem massive amounts of compute, they would be able to train frontier models, greatly increasing their share of inference. Their startups and AI services would be in much better positions against ours across a variety of sizes and use cases. Our commercial and cultural power would wane.</p>\n<p>Compute is the building block of the future. We have it. They want it.</p>\n<p>Our advantage in compute could rapidly turn into a large disadvantage. China\u2019s greatest strength in AI is that it has essentially unlimited access to electrical power. If allowed to buy the chips, China could build unlimited data centers and eclipse us.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What About That All Important \u2018Tech Stack\u2019?</h4>\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s nothing new here, but let\u2019s go over this again.</p>\n<p>Even if you think AI is all about soft power, cultural influence, economic power and \u2018market share,\u2019 ultimately what matters is who is using which models.</p>\n<p>Chip sales are profitable, but the money involved is, in relative terms, chump change.</p>\n<p>The reason \u2018market share of chip sales\u2019 is touted as a major policy goal by David Sacks and similar others is the idea of what have dubbed the \u2018tech stack\u2019 combining chips with an AI model, and sometimes other vertical integrations as well such as the physical data center and cloud services. Thanks to the benefits of integration, they say, it will be a battle of an American stack (e.g. Nvidia + OpenAI) against a Chinese stack (e.g. Huawei + DeepSeek).</p>\n<p>The whole thing is a mirage.</p>\n<p>As an obvious example of this, notice that Anthropic is happy to use chips from three distinct stacks: Microsoft Azure + Nvidia, Amazon Web Services + Tritanium and Google Cloud + TPUs, and everyone agrees that doing this was a great move modulo the related security concerns.</p>\n<p>There are some benefits to close integration between chips and models, so yes you would design them around each other when you can.</p>\n<p>But those gains are relatively modest. You can mostly run inference and training for any model on any generally sufficiently capable chip, with only modest efficiency loss. You can take a model trained on one chip and run it on another, or one from another manufacturer, and people often do.</p>\n<p>Chinese models work much better on Nvidia chips, and when they have access to vastly more chips and more compute. They can be shifted at will. There is no stack.</p>\n<p>There is another \u2018tech stack\u2019 concept in the idea of a company like Microsoft selling a full-stack data center project, that is shovel ready, to a nation like Saudi Arabia. That\u2019s a sensible way to make things easy on the buyer and lock in a deal. But this has nothing to do with what would happen if you sold highly capable AI chips to China.</p>\n<p>The argument for exporting our full \u2018tech stack\u2019 to third party nations like Saudi Arabia or the UAE was that they would otherwise make a deal to get Chinese chips and then run Chinese models. That\u2019s silly, in that the Chinese Huawei chips are not up to the task and not available in such quantities, but on some level it makes sense.</p>\n<p>Whereas here it makes no sense. You\u2019re selling the Nvidia chips to literal China. They\u2019re not going to use them to run ChatGPT or Claude. Every chip they buy helps train better Chinese models, and is one more chip they have spare for export.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Selling H200s Hurts America In The AI Race</h4>\n\n\n<p>The most important weapon in the AI race is compute.</p>\n<p>If it is so important to \u2018win the AI race\u2019 and not \u2018lose to China,\u2019 the last thing we should be doing is selling highly capable AI chips to China.</p>\n<p>If you want to sell the H200 to China, you are not prioritizing beating China.</p>\n<p>Or rather, when you say \u2018beat China\u2019 you mean \u2018maximize Nvidia\u2019s market share of chips sold, even if this turbocharges their labs and models and inference.\u2019</p>\n<p>That may be David Sacks\u2019s priority. It is not mine. See it for what it is.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/S_OhEigeartaigh/status/1998306169480151196\">Se\u00e1n \u00d3 h\u00c9igeartaigh</a>: The \u2018AI race with China\u2019 has been used to argue for everything from federal investment in AI to laxer environmental laws to laxer child protection laws to energy buildout to, most recently, pre-emption &#8211; by both USG and leading AI lobby groups.</p>\n<p>But nothing has been more impactful on the \u2018AI race\u2019 by a long shot than export controls on advanced chips. If they really cared about the AI race, they\u2019d support that. H200s getting approved for sale to China another piece of evidence that this is more about making money than anything else.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a classic securitisation move: make something a matter of existential national importance, thus shielding it from democratic scrutiny.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/bonchieredstate/status/1998183316777038237\">Bonchie</a>: Kind of hard to keep telling people that they must accept bad policy to \u201cwin the AI race against China,\u201d when we turn around and sell them the chips they need to win the AI race.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nvidia Number Did Not Go Up That Much</h4>\n\n\n<p>Nvidia, down about 7% over the last month, did pop ~1.3% on the announcement. In the day since it\u2019s given half of that back, with an overnight pop in between.</p>\n<p>You might assume that, whoever else lost, at least Nvidia would win from this. The market is not so clear on that.</p>\n<p>This leaves a few possibilities:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>This probably won\u2019t happen, America will walk it back.</li>\n<li>This probably won\u2019t happen, China will refuse the chips.</li>\n<li>This probably won\u2019t happen de facto because of the GAIN Act or similar.</li>\n<li>This probably won\u2019t happen at scale, there will be strict limits.</li>\n<li>This probably won\u2019t happen at scale, the 25% tax is too large.</li>\n<li>This probably will happen, but at 25% tax it\u2019s not good for Nvidia.</li>\n<li>This probably will happen but market was hoping for better.</li>\n<li>This was largely already priced in.</li>\n<li>Markets are weird, yo.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/09/nvidia-gets-the-ok-from-trump-to-sell-chips-to-china-is-it-a-reason-to-buy-the-stock.html\">CNBC\u2019s analysis here</a> expects $3.5 billion in quarterly revenue, which would be a disaster for national security and presumably boost the stock. But then again, consider that Nvidia is capacity constrained. They can already sell all their chips. So do they want to be selling some of them with a 25% tax attached in a vainglorious quest for \u2018market share\u2019? The market might think Jensen Huang is selling out America without even getting more profit in return.</p>\n<p>Another factor is that when the announcement was made, the Nasdaq ex-Nvidia didn\u2019t blick, nor was there a substantial move in AMD or Intel. Selling China a lot of inference chips should be bad for American customers of Nvidia, given supply is limited, so that moves us towards either \u2018this won\u2019t happen at scale\u2019 or \u2018this was already priced in.\u2019 I don\u2019t give the market credit for fully pricing things like this in.</p>\n<p>What happens next? Congress and others who think this is a no-good, very bad move for America will see how much they can mitigate the damage. Sales will only happen over time, so there are various ways to try and stop this from happening.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h4>"
