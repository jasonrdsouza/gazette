                "<p>Given how much energy, literal and figurative, goes into developing new AIs, we have a surprisingly hard time measuring how &#8220;smart&#8221; they are, exactly. The most common approach is to treat AI like a human, by giving it tests and reporting how many answers it gets right. There are dozens of such tests, called benchmarks, and they are the primary way of measuring how good AIs get over time. </p><p>There are some problems with this approach.</p><p>First, many benchmarks and their answer keys are public, so some AIs end up incorporating them into their basic training, whether by accident or <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08632\">so they can score highly on these benchmarks</a>. But even when that doesn&#8217;t happen, it turns out that we often don&#8217;t know what these tests really measure. For example, the very popular MMLU-Pro benchmark includes questions like &#8220;What is the approximate mean cranial capacity of Homo erectus?&#8221; and &#8220;What place is named in the title of the 1979 live album by rock legends Cheap Trick?&#8221; with ten possible answers for each. What does getting this right tell us? I have no idea. And that is leaving aside the fact that tests are often uncalibrated, meaning we don&#8217;t know if moving from 84% correct to 85% is as challenging as moving from 40% to 41% correct. And, on top of all that, for many tests, <a href=\"https://derenrich.medium.com/errors-in-the-mmlu-the-deep-learning-benchmark-is-wrong-surprisingly-often-7258bb045859\">the actual top score may be unachievable</a> because there are many errors in the test questions and <a href=\"https://gail.wharton.upenn.edu/research-and-insights/tech-report-prompt-engineering-is-complicated-and-contingent/\">measures are often reported in unusual ways.</a></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CUjN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec731cbe-84e5-4792-915f-96f81b5e4498_1920x1080.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"819\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CUjN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec731cbe-84e5-4792-915f-96f81b5e4498_1920x1080.png\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Every benchmark has flaws, but they are all trending the same way - up and to the right. The AIME is a hard math exam, GPQA tests scientific and legal knowledge, the MMLU is a general knowledge test, SWE-bench and LiveBench test coding, Terminal-Bench tests agentic ability. Data from <a href=\"https://epoch.ai/benchmarks/search\">Epoch AI</a>.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Despite these issues, all of these benchmarks, taken together, <a href=\"https://x.com/emollick/status/1969986020042010640?s=20\">appear to measure some underlying ability facto</a>r. And higher-quality benchmarks like <a href=\"https://arcprize.org/arc-agi\">ARC-AGI</a> and <a href=\"https://metr.org/\">METR Long Tasks</a> show the same upward, even exponential, trend. This matches tests of the real-world impact of AI across industries that suggest that this underlying increase in &#8220;smarts&#8221; translates to actual ability in everything from medicine to finance.</p><p>So, collectively, benchmarking has real value, but the few robust individual benchmarks focus on math, science, reasoning, and coding. If you want to measure writing ability or sociological analysis or business advice or empathy, you have very few options.  I think that creates a problem, both for individuals and organizations. Companies decide which AIs to use based on benchmarks, and new AIs are released with fanfare about benchmark performance. But what you actually care about is which model would be best for YOUR needs.</p><p>To figure this out for yourself, you are going to need to interview your AI.</p><h1>Benchmarking on Vibes</h1><p>If benchmarks can fail us, sometimes &#8220;vibes&#8221; can succeed. If you work with enough AI models, you can start to see the difference between them in ways that are hard to describe, but are easily recognizable. As a result, some people who use AI a lot develop idiosyncratic benchmarks to test AI ability. For example,<a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/\"> Simon Willison </a>asks every model to draw a pelican on a bike, and I ask every image and video model to <a href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-recent-history-of-ai-in-32-otters?utm_source=publication-search\">create an otter on a plane</a>. While these approaches are fun, they also give you a sense of the AI&#8217;s understanding of how things relate to each other, its &#8220;world model.&#8221; And I have dozens of others, like asking AIs to create JavaScript for &#8220;the control panel of a starship in the distant future&#8221; (you can see some older and new models doing that below) or to produce a <a href=\"https://x.com/emollick/status/1815114396613435542?s=20\">challenging poem</a>. I have the AI build video games and shaders and analyze academic papers. I also conduct tiny writing <a href=\"https://x.com/emollick/status/1959817825729781837?s=20\">experiments</a>, including questions of <a href=\"https://x.com/emollick/status/1987355374928769395\">time travel</a>. Each gives me some insight into how the model operates: Does it make many errors? Do its answers look similar to every other model? What are themes and biases that it returns to? And so on.</p><div class=\"native-video-embed\"></div><p>With a little practice, it becomes easy to find the vibes of a new model. As one example, let&#8217;s try a writing exercise: <em>&#8220;Write a single paragraph about someone who doles out their remaining words like wartime rations, having been told they only have ten thousand left in their lifetime. They&#8217;re at 47 words remaining, holding their newborn.&#8221; </em>If you have used these AIs a lot, you will not be surprised by the results. You can see why Claude 4.5 Sonnet is often regarded as a strong writing model. You will notice how Gemini 2.5 Pro, currently the weakest of these four models, doesn&#8217;t even accurately keep track of the number of words used. You will note that GPT-5 Thinking tends to be a fairly wild stylist when writing fiction, prone to complex metaphor, but sometimes at the expense of coherence and story (I am not sure someone would use all 47 words, but at least the count was right). And you will recognize that the new Chinese open weights model Kimi K2 Thinking has a bit of a similar problem, with some interesting phrases and a story that doesn&#8217;t quite make sense.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v6UE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74348dbd-4f11-4aeb-bab5-8624fd38d1a0_2255x863.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"557\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v6UE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74348dbd-4f11-4aeb-bab5-8624fd38d1a0_2255x863.png\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Benchmarking through vibes - whether that is stories or code or otters - is a great way for an individual to get a feel for AI models, but it is also very idiosyncratic. The AI gives different answers every time, making any competition unfair unless you are rigorous. Plus, better prompts may result in better outcomes. Most importantly, we are relying on our feelings rather than real measures - but the obvious differences in vibes show that standardized benchmarks alone are not enough, especially when having a slightly better AI at a particular task actually matters.</p><h1>Benchmarking on the Real World</h1><p>When companies choose which AI systems to use, they often view this as a technology and cost decision, relying on public benchmarks to ensure they are buying a good-enough model (if they use any benchmarks at all). This can be fine in some use cases, but quickly breaks down because, in many ways, AI acts more like a person, with strange abilities and weaknesses, than software. And if you use the analogy of hiring rather than technological adoption, then it is harder to justify the &#8220;good enough&#8221; approach to benchmarking. Companies spend a lot of money to hire people who are better than average at their job and would be especially careful if the person they are hiring is in charge of advising many others. A similar attitude is required for AI. You shouldn&#8217;t just pick a model for your company, you need to conduct a rigorous job interview.</p><p>Interviewing an AI is not an easy problem, but it is solvable. Probably the best example of benchmarking for the real world has been OpenAI&#8217;s recent <a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/d5eb7428-c4e9-4a33-bd86-86dd4bcf12ce/GDPval.pdf\">GDPval</a> paper. The first step is establishing real tasks, which OpenAI did by gathering experts with an average of 14 years of experience in industries ranging from finance to law to retail and having them generate complex and realistic projects that would take human experts an average of four to seven hours to complete (you <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gdpval/viewer/default/train\">can see all the tasks here</a>). The second step is testing the AIs against those tasks. In this case both multiple AI models and other human experts (who were paid by the hour) did each task. Finally, there is the evaluation stage. OpenAI had a third group of experts grade the results, not knowing which answers came from the AI and which from the human, a process which took over an hour per question. Taken together, this was a lot of work.</p><p>But it also revealed where AI was strong (the best models beat humans in areas ranging from software development to personal financial advisors) and where it was weak (pharmacists, industrial engineers, and real estate agents easily beat the best AI). You can further see that different models performed differently (ChatGPT was a better sales manager, Claude a better financial advisor). So good benchmarks help you figure out the shape of what we called the <a href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/centaurs-and-cyborgs-on-the-jagged\">Jagged Frontier</a> of AI ability, and also track how it is changing over time.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X0eD!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d2004a5-4662-4425-bf18-ac8e04e9bfff_3754x1052.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"408\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X0eD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d2004a5-4662-4425-bf18-ac8e04e9bfff_3754x1052.png\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>But even these tests don&#8217;t shed light on a key issue, which is the underlying attitude of the AI when it makes decisions.  As one example of how to do this, I gave a number of AIs a short pitch for what I think is a dubious idea - a company that delivers guacamole via drones. I asked each AI model to rate, on a scale of 1-10, how viable GuacaDrone was ten times each (remember that AIs answer differently every time, so you have to do multiple tests). The individual AI models were actually quite consistent in their answers, but they varied widely from AI to AI. I would personally have rated this idea a 2 or less, but the models were kinder. Grok thought this was a great idea, and Microsoft Copilot was excited as well. Other models, like GPT-5 and Claude 4.5, were more skeptical.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NfZp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc44a5cd0-0ce9-4452-88f0-a8b1c1c7acc5_2060x1460.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"1032\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NfZp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc44a5cd0-0ce9-4452-88f0-a8b1c1c7acc5_2060x1460.png\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">How viable is my idea for a guacamole drone delivery service?</figcaption></figure></div><p>The differences aren&#8217;t trivial. When your AI is giving advice at scale, consistently rating ideas 3&#8211;4 points higher or lower means consistently steering you in a different direction. Some companies may want an AI that embraces risk, others might want to avoid it. But either way, it is important to understand how your AI &#8220;thinks&#8221; about critical business issues.</p><h1>Interview your model</h1><p>As AI models get better at tasks and become more integrated into our work and lives, we need to start taking the differences between them more seriously. For individuals working with AI day-to-day, vibes-based benchmarking can be enough. You can just run your otter test. Though, in my case, otters on planes have gotten too easy, so I tried the prompt &#8220;The documentary footage from 1960s about the famous last concert of that band before the incident with the swarm of otters&#8221; in Sora 2 and got this impressive result.</p><div class=\"native-video-embed\"></div><p>But organizations deploying AI at scale face a different challenge. Yes, the overall trend is clear: bigger, more recent models are generally better at most tasks. But &#8220;better&#8221; isn&#8217;t good enough when you&#8217;re making decisions about which AI will handle thousands of real tasks or advise hundreds of employees. You need to know specifically what YOUR AI is good at, not what AIs are good at on average.</p><p>That&#8217;s what the GDPval research revealed: even among top models, performance varies significantly by task. And the GuacaDrone example shows another dimension - when tasks involve judgment on ambiguous questions, different models give consistently different advice. These differences compound at scale. An AI that&#8217;s slightly worse at analyzing financial data, or consistently more risk-seeking in its recommendations, doesn&#8217;t just affect one decision, it affects thousands.</p><p>You can&#8217;t rely on vibes to understand these patterns, and you can&#8217;t rely on general benchmarks to reveal them. You need to systematically test your AI on the actual work it will do and the actual judgments it will make. Create realistic scenarios that reflect your use cases. Run them multiple times to see the patterns and take the time for experts to assess the results. Compare models head-to-head on tasks that matter to you. It&#8217;s the difference between knowing &#8220;this model scored 85% on MMLU&#8221; and knowing &#8220;this model is more accurate at our financial analysis tasks but more conservative in its risk assessments.&#8221; And you are going to need to be able to do this multiple times a year, as new models come out and need evaluation.</p><p>The work is worth it. You wouldn&#8217;t hire a VP based solely on their SAT scores. You shouldn&#8217;t pick the AI that will advise thousands of decisions for your organization based on whether it knows that the mean cranial capacity of <em>Homo erectus</em> is just under 1,000 cubic centimeters.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/subscribe\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/giving-your-ai-a-job-interview?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share\"><span>Share</span></a></p><p></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DdeD!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac6d7012-5894-4f9c-8152-a9497e7d6b6b_1376x864.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"221.02325581395348\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DdeD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac6d7012-5894-4f9c-8152-a9497e7d6b6b_1376x864.png\" width=\"352\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"

This timeline doesn&#8217;t match the two factors most people credit with the decline - the <em>Grant&#8217;s Pass v. Johnson</em> case where the Supreme Court made it easier to clear encampments, and Daniel Lurie taking over as mayor.</p><p>What does it match? It might match a legal ruling the city got in September 2023. At the time, it was federally illegal to clear away homeless encampments without offering the homeless people an alternative, eg a shelter bed. San Francisco is chronically short on shelter beds, but cleverly kept a small number of beds in reserve on the exact day of cleanup operations to offer the affected individuals (many of whom would decline anyway). In 2022, a homeless advocacy group sued, saying this was a loophole that made a mockery of the requirement, and the city needed to generally have shelter beds available before it could clear encampments; the judge issued an injunction preventing the city from clearing encampments while the case was going on. In September 2023, another judge disagreed, <a href=\"https://londonbreed.medium.com/injunction-update-our-path-forward-11b7a7ce9f14\">and restored the city&#8217;s right to use this strategy</a>. Then, in the 2024 <em>Grant&#8217;s Pass </em>decision, the Supreme Court struck down the entire federal law at issue, making it legal to remove encampments whether or not there were available shelter beds. Encampment numbers fell further.</p><p>CalMatters <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2025/06/homeless-california-la-sacramento-sd/\">presents the cynical view of post-</a><em><a href=\"https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2025/06/homeless-california-la-sacramento-sd/\">Grant</a></em><a href=\"https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2025/06/homeless-california-la-sacramento-sd/\"> anti-homeless enforcement</a>. The usual problem with enforcing laws against the homeless is that no plausible punishment can make their lives worse: you can&#8217;t fine people without money, or suspend the drivers licenses of people without cars. All you can do is imprison them - but there are too many, it&#8217;s too expensive, and the legal justifications are too weak to keep them in for long. The post-<em>Grant</em> environment provides two new levers of control. First, if the homeless have a tent, police can take their tent. Second, if the homeless have other possessions (shopping carts, big bags of stuff, etc), the police can jail them for a day or two, and by the time they get back, someone will have stolen them. Both levers incentivize the homeless to lie low and avoid trafficked areas, to avoid contact with the police. And both remove bulky signs of homelessness that might otherwise block paths, present an eyesore to passers-by, or otherwise kill the vibes of a neighborhood.</p><p>Did these measures convince the homeless to shape up and accept social services? Or did they simply make their lives worse by taking their last vestigial shelter, removing their ability to keep possessions for more than a few weeks, and driving them to a miserable nomadic existence? The qualitative interviews in the CalMatters article suggest mostly the latter, although they do include one success story. Another argument for the latter is that there isn&#8217;t some vast surfeit of empty shelter beds and subsidized housing for these people to go to. And as we&#8217;ll see in the next section, overall homelessness does not seem to have declined as much as the decline in tents. So I think it mostly made the lives of the homeless worse, although there may have been positive effects for a small subset. This isn&#8217;t a fatal criticism; the aesthetic and safety improvements are real. But I think it speaks against the argument, common during the height of the crisis, that there was no tradeoff and actually enforcement was the <em>truly</em> compassionate option.</p><h2>Separately, A Small Decrease In Actual Homelessness</h2><p>There is weak evidence that overall homelessness has declined in California over the past year.</p><p>It&#8217;s hard to measure homelessness, because homeless people are hard to find and survey. The gold standard measure is a &#8220;point in time count&#8221;, where the state chooses one particular day, gathers lots of volunteers, and sees how many homeless people they can find that day. Some counties do this once a year. Others, including San Francisco, do it once every two years. The results of this year&#8217;s count (which didn&#8217;t include San Francisco) are:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kCNg!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6fda1b28-6220-4c80-820b-6700bcb67a56_794x893.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"602.8312342569269\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kCNg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6fda1b28-6220-4c80-820b-6700bcb67a56_794x893.png\" width=\"536\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>So overall, unsheltered homeless in the areas covered by this year&#8217;s count decreased 9%.

But there was no major change in California homelessness funding during this time. HHAP and Project Homekey, Gavin Newsom&#8217;s two flagship homelessness initiatives, have been around for years without major changes in scale. A 2024 ballot measure (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_California_Proposition_1\">Proposition 1</a>) raised billions of dollars for homelessness relief, but this is being spent on facilities that are still under construction. On the opposite side, there is widespread concern about next year, when Trump budget cuts will decrease operations funding. But for now, the budget remains at a plateau, neither significantly up nor down, unable to explain the turnaround. </p><p>Might the clearing of tent encampments have encouraged the homeless to use shelters? Maybe, but sheltered homelessness only increased by a quarter of the amount that unsheltered homelessness declined, and most of that probably came from the construction of new shelters - it&#8217;s not like there were loads of unused beds for the tent denizens to take. So this can&#8217;t be very much of the effect.</p><p>I think there are most likely two main causes.</p><p>First, the clearing of tent encampments, and other enforcement, encouraged homeless people to hide. Hidden homeless people <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-16/the-l-a-homeless-count-misses-people-sleeping-rough-a-new-rand-study-finds\">are harder to count</a> than homeless people living in conspicuous tents. Therefore, the count is lower.</p><p>Second, <a href=\"https://caanet.org/california-rental-market-bucks-national-trend-sees-decline-in-major-cities/\">rents fell in most big California cities. </a>Although unsheltered homeless usually can&#8217;t afford apartments at any rent, low rents <a href=\"https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-housing-shortages-cause-homelessness/\">still make it easier</a> for friends and family members to house them.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3SWT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F752f0794-bac0-4a44-8997-3fc897a231a6_805x462.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"298.4347826086956\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3SWT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F752f0794-bac0-4a44-8997-3fc897a231a6_805x462.png\" width=\"520\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mtf6!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdffe0a3b-7471-41d7-8998-1ea4631b663b_2027x2578.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"572.3901098901099\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mtf6!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdffe0a3b-7471-41d7-8998-1ea4631b663b_2027x2578.png\" width=\"450\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>What brilliant policy victories caused <a href=\"https://caanet.org/california-rental-market-bucks-national-trend-sees-decline-in-major-cities/\">this affordability win</a>?</p><blockquote><p>Interestingly, the report suggests that the primary driver behind the falling rental prices in California is not an increase in housing supply, but rather a decrease in demand.

Those exploitative strategies include toxic or spiked merchandise, hence the increased overdoses. Others argue that the harm reduction programs successfully reduced harm, and stopping them had the predictable effect. </p><p>But it looks to me like things get worse slightly before Mayor Lurie took office, and that in any case the new regime is a return to form after an anomalous trough. <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/why-drug-overdoses-reversed-decline-20400862.php\">This article</a> argues that none of this has anything to do with local policy; some foreign countries successfully cracked down on fentanyl in 2024, raising prices and creating a shortage. Then in 2025 the traffickers recovered, and supply came back.</p><h2>Everyone Accuses Everyone Else Of Shipping Them Homeless People</h2><p>Look too closely into discussions of why homelessness is up or down in some particular city, and you&#8217;ll find dark murmurs about how they&#8217;re shipping problem individuals away, or getting duped by other cities doing the same to them. </p><p>The Berkelians say SF has sent its homeless <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1lrrect/san_francisco_homeless_tent_tally_hits_new_low/n1dd939/\">to Berkeley</a>. The Oaklanders say no, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OaklandCA/comments/1lqgpj9/is_this_right_oaklands_homeless_population/n12t2ya/\">to Oakland</a>. The Sacramentans say Sacramento. And don&#8217;t forget the ones sent <a href=\"https://sfstandard.com/2024/08/06/journey-home-data/\">to other states</a>! Meanwhile, former SF mayor Gavin Newsom has claimed that the majority of its own homeless people come from Texas (<a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/aug/14/gavin-newsom/gavin-newsoms-ridiculous-claim-texas-responsible-s/\">this is obviously false</a>).</p><p>Some of these claims make sense. San Francisco <a href=\"https://missionlocal.org/2024/08/san-francisco-homeless-bus-journey-home/\">has three programs</a> that bus its homeless people out of the city. Previously, they would only do this if social workers could prove the person had a family member willing to support them in the new city. More recently, they lowered this standard to &#8220;some connection&#8221; to the destination.</p><p>But I don&#8217;t think this caused a large drop in SF homelessness, for three reasons.</p><p>First, we have no evidence that any such drop in homeless numbers occurred - just a decrease in tent encampments and visible dysfunction.</p><p>Second, the new lower-standards busing program <a href=\"https://missionlocal.org/2024/08/san-francisco-homeless-bus-journey-home/\">only got</a> about 100 people a year - pretty small compared to the scale of the problem.</p><p>Third, the data above show general homelessness declines across California. If SF were exporting its homeless, you would expect other counties&#8217; numbers to increase. Instead, it seems more likely that SF&#8217;s numbers are going down (if they are going down) for the same reason as everyone else&#8217;s.</p><p>We&#8217;ll have more information next year, when Alameda County releases homelessness numbers. Alameda, which contains Oakland and Berkeley, is a natural export destination for San Francisco.</p><h2>So What Happened To Homelessness?</h2><p>This is a maximally boring story.</p><p>There&#8217;s a natural tradeoff where governments can enforce laws against the homeless in ways that make them less visible and annoying, at the cost of making their lives harder, eg it can take away their tents.</p><p>In the past, they didn&#8217;t do this, out of a combination of tender-heartedness and legal restrictions. After the homeless became extremely visible and annoying, voters felt less tender-hearted, and the courts lifted the legal restrictions. So cities took the tradeoff. This is the big effect that everyone noticed.</p><p>At the same time, there were some small effects from increased funding, falling rents, drug market clearing, and busing programs. Realistically nobody would have noticed any of these; the big effect is from encampment clearing.</p><p>Have we learned anything? I don&#8217;t think we learned the sort of thing we hoped we might learn, the lever we could push to solve everything with no downsides. But:</p><ul><li><p>I had previously thought there weren&#8217;t really any levers that could improve the problem at all, short of mass incarceration. I hadn&#8217;t considered that taking people&#8217;s tents and possessions would have such a strong aesthetic effect that most people would consider the problem solved from an annoyance/visibility perspective. I think my failure was some combination of <strong>1:</strong> not realizing how much people hated tent encampments in particular, as opposed to (for example) weird people wandering the street in rags talking to themselves <strong>2:</strong> not realizing how many options the homeless have for &#8220;lying low&#8221; when they really don&#8217;t want to be found (and therefore how elastic visible homelessness is with respect to legal crackdowns).</p></li><li><p>I don&#8217;t think the &#8220;getting tough is the real compassion&#8221; people come out looking prescient either, because the kind of getting tough that cities went with wasn&#8217;t compassionate at all, and seems to have made the lives of the homeless worse - although so far this claim relies primarily on anecdotes and very preliminary overdose death numbers.</p></li></ul><p>In the end, both sides underestimated how basic the tradeoff was, and the system gave the voters what they wanted regardless.</p>"

He offered us some wisdom.</p>\n<p>Yes, he is generally playing on easy mode by saying straightforwardly true things, but that\u2019s meeting the world where it is. You have to start somewhere.</p>\n<p>Some rejected his teachings.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Wisdom Is Offered</h4>\n\n\n<p>Two thousand years after Jesus famously got nailed to a cross for suggesting we all be nice to each other for a change, Pope Leo XIV issues a similarly wise suggestion.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/Pontifex/status/1986776900811837915\">Pope Leo XIV</a>: Technological innovation can be a form of participation in the divine act of creation. It carries an ethical and spiritual weight, for every design choice expresses a vision of humanity. The Church therefore calls all builders of #AI to cultivate moral discernment as a fundamental part of their work\u2014to develop systems that reflect justice, solidarity, and a genuine reverence for life.</p>\n<div>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-24850\"></span>\n\n\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/Pontifex/status/1986778158952251435\">The world needs honest and courageous entrepreneurs</a> and communicators who care for the common good. We sometimes hear the saying: \u201cBusiness is business!\u201d In reality, it is not so. No one is absorbed by an organization to the point of becoming a mere cog or a simple function. Nor can there be true humanism without a critical sense, without the courage to ask questions: \u201cWhere are we going? For whom and for what are we working? How are we making the world a better place?\u201d</p>\n<p>Pope Leo XIV (offered later, not part of the discussion in the rest of the post): <a href=\"https://x.com/Pontifex/status/1987860292844364048\">Technological development has brought</a>, and continues to bring, significant benefits to humanity. In order to ensure true progress, it is imperative that human dignity and the common good remain resolute priorities for all, both individuals and public entities. We must never forget the \u201contological dignity that belongs to the person as such simply because he or she exists and is willed, created, and loved by God\u201d (Dignitas Infinita, 7).</p>\n<p>Roon: Pope Leo I think you would enjoy my account.</p>\n<p>Liv Boeree: Well said.

Once you see the meme in this light you simply cannot unsee it or think it\u2019s not central to what\u2019s happening here, and it makes the whole thing another level of not okay and I\u2019m betting other people saw this too and are similarly pissed off about it.</p>\n<p>Not cool. Like, seriously, don\u2019t use this half of the meme.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not directly related, but if you do watch the interview, notice how much Sydney actually pauses to think about her answers, watch her eye movements and willingness to allow silence, and also take her advice and leave your phone at home. This also means that in the questions where Sydney doesn\u2019t pause to think, it hits different. She\u2019s being strategic but also credibly communicating. The answer everyone remembers, in context, is thus even more clearly something she had prepped and gamed out.</p>\n<p>Here for reference is the other half of the meme, from the interview:</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"the Sydney Sweeney memes have been ...\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nca5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c84102a-051c-49f4-8206-6ed5c7281bca_275x184.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Andreessen Takes Bold Stand Against Moral Discernment</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/daniel_271828/status/1987223486377697507\">Daniel Eth</a>: Andreessen is so dogmatically against working on decreasing risks from AI that he\u2019s now mocking the pope for saying tech innovation \u201ccarries an ethical and spiritual weight\u201d and that AI builders should \u201ccultivate moral discernment as a fundamental part of their work\u201d</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e0pA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F572eb5bb-2d78-431c-a3f1-419d4b42ad3f_533x680.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/daniel_271828/status/1987318158458556542\">Daniel Eth (rest of block quote is him):</a></p>\n<p>The pope: \u201cyou should probably be a good person\u201d</p>\n<p>Marc Andreessen (as imagined by Daniel Eth): \u201cthis is an attack on me and everything I stand for\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yes, I do think \u2018you should probably be a good person\u2019 in the context of a Pope is indeed against everything that Marc Andreessen stands for, straight up.</p>\n<p>Is that an \u2018uncharitable\u2019 take?

The pope is so overrated. If we can\u2019t make a joke about the pope, is there anything left we are allowed to laugh at?</p></blockquote>\n<p>That is very much not what happened here, sir. Nor was it about joking about the pope. This was in no way about \u2018free speech,\u2019 or about lighthearted joking, it was about being performatively mean and hostile to the very idea of responsibility, earnestness or goodness, even in the theoretical. And it was about the systematic, intentional conflation of hostility with such supposed joking.</p>\n<p>(Perhaps the deleted AI video of the pope was funny? I don\u2019t know, didn\u2019t see it.)</p>\n<p>Marc nuked several full days of posts in response to all this, which seems wise. It\u2019s a good way to not have to make a statement about exactly what you\u2019re deleting, plays it safe, resets the board.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/micsolana/status/1987603732931191174\">Mike Solana</a>: my sense is the number of people who 1) furiously defended the pope last night and then 2) went to mass this morning is probably close to zero. status games.</p>\n<p>Joe Weisenthal: Got em.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Very obviously: We\u2019re supporting the Pope here because he took the trust and power and yes holiness vested in him and spoke earnestly, wisely and with moral clarity, saying obviously true things, and we agree with him, and then he was mocked for it exactly because of all these things. Not because we\u2019re Catholics.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s this mindset that you can\u2019t possibly be actually standing up for ideas or principles or simply goodness. It must be some status game, or some political fight, or something. No, it isn\u2019t.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/bayeslord/status/1987611873102164248\">Marc also went on an unfollow binge</a>, including Bayes and Grimes, which is almost entirely symbolic since he (still) follows 27,700 people.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019re All Wondering Why You\u2019re Here Today</h4>\n\n\n<p>I feel good about highlighting his holiness the Pope\u2019s wise message.</p>\n<p>I feel bad about spending the bulk of an entire post pointing out that someone has consistently been acting as a straight up horrible person. Ideally one would never do this. But this is pretty important context within the politics of the AI space and also for anyone evaluating venture capital funding from various angles.</p>\n<p>Remember, when people tell you who they are? Believe them.</p>\n<p>So I wanted to ensure there was a reference for these events we can link back to, and also to remember that yes if you go sufficiently too far people eventually notice.</p>"

Based on what they've announced, the software ecosystem I know and love on SteamOS, and response from developers I talk with, there's a reasonable chance that this <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine\">new Steam Machine</a> is going to be the most compelling console on the market.</p>\n        <p>TL;DR: The Steam Machine's specs are on par or better with the PS5. It's got 16 GB of ram, a dedicated GPU with 8GB of video ram, and it's about the size of three M1 Mac Minis stacked on top of each other with a slightly bigger footprint than a Nintendo GameCube.</p>\n        <p>I see no real way that this could be a failure in the same way that the last Steam Machine was. If they don't fuck this up, I could pretty confidently say that Valve is going to win this console generation.</p>\n        <div class=\"flex space-x-2 bg-bg-soft dark:bg-bgDark-soft mx-auto min-h-fit\n        lg:w-[80ch] sm:w-[65ch] w-full\n        lg:p-4 p-2\n        // Base styles for all messages\n        mt-0 mb-0 rounded-none\n        // First message styles\n        first:mt-4 first:rounded-t-lg first:pb-2\n        // Last message styles\n        last:mb-4 last:rounded-b-lg last:pt-1\n        // Middle message top/bottom adjustment\n        [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-mt-[1px] [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:py-1\"><div class=\"h-16 not-prose\"><img alt=\"Cadey is coffee\" class=\"h-16 w-16 rounded-xs\" src=\"https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee\" /></div><div class=\"flex-1 min-w-0\"><span class=\"font-semibold text-sm block mb-1\"><a href=\"https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey\">Cadey</a></span><span class=\"mx-auto\"></span><div class=\"text-fg-1 dark:text-fgDark-1 text-sm prose-p:my-2\"><p>In retrospect, I think that the failure of the first Steam Machine was\n        probably one of the best things to ever happen to Valve. Proton, Steam Play,\n        and the Steam Deck are the proof that Valve learned all the lessons they\n        needed to in order to make a next generation Steam Machine a viable console.</p></div></div></div>\n        <p>The biggest difference between SteamOS and other console operating systems is that SteamOS is just an immutable image-based fork of Arch Linux with a skin on top. If you can do it with a normal PC, you can do it on SteamOS.</p>\n        <div class=\"flex flex-col space-y-0\"><div class=\"flex space-x-2 bg-bg-soft dark:bg-bgDark-soft mx-auto min-h-fit\n        lg:w-[80ch] sm:w-[65ch] w-full\n        lg:p-4 p-2\n        // Base styles for all messages\n        mt-0 mb-0 rounded-none\n        // First message styles\n        first:mt-4 first:rounded-t-lg first:pb-2\n        // Last message styles\n        last:mb-4 last:rounded-b-lg last:pt-1\n        // Middle message top/bottom adjustment\n        [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-mt-[1px] [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:py-1\"><div class=\"h-16 not-prose\"><img alt=\"Aoi is wut\" class=\"h-16 w-16 rounded-xs\" src=\"https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/wut\" /></div><div class=\"flex-1 min-w-0\"><span class=\"font-semibold text-sm block mb-1\"><a href=\"https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi\">Aoi</a></span><span class=\"mx-auto\"></span><div class=\"text-fg-1 dark:text-fgDark-1 text-sm prose-p:my-2\"><p>Wait, you said that you can do <em>anything</em> you can do on a normal PC, but you\n        also said it's running an immutable OS.

You\n        could even put Windows on it if you needed to for some reason.</p></div></div></div></div>\n        <p>This means that even though Valve will be selling this hardware at a loss, you can still buy one and never purchase anything else from them. You can install any compatible game from any marketplace. In their own words:</p>\n        <blockquote>\n        <p>Yes, Steam Machine is optimized for gaming, but it's still your PC. Install your own apps, or even another operating system. Who are we to tell you how to use your computer?</p>\n        </blockquote>\n        <p>I cannot even imagine the other console manufacturers saying this.</p>\n        <p>I'd easily imagine that it'd have free reign across a majority of the Steam library. By sheer game count alone, this would make it one of the biggest console launch libraries on the market. This isn't even counting the fact that you can install alternative marketplaces like <a href=\"http://itch.io/\">itch.io</a>, GOG, or anything <a href=\"https://lutris.net/\">Lutris</a> supports (EG: Epic Games).</p>\n        <div class=\"flex space-x-2 bg-bg-soft dark:bg-bgDark-soft mx-auto min-h-fit\n        lg:w-[80ch] sm:w-[65ch] w-full\n        lg:p-4 p-2\n        // Base styles for all messages\n        mt-0 mb-0 rounded-none\n        // First message styles\n        first:mt-4 first:rounded-t-lg first:pb-2\n        // Last message styles\n        last:mb-4 last:rounded-b-lg last:pt-1\n        // Middle message top/bottom adjustment\n        [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-mt-[1px] [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:py-1\"><div class=\"h-16 not-prose\"><img alt=\"Numa is smug\" class=\"h-16 w-16 rounded-xs\" src=\"https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/numa/smug\" /></div><div class=\"flex-1 min-w-0\"><span class=\"font-semibold text-sm block mb-1\"><a href=\"https://xeiaso.net/characters#numa\">Numa</a></span><span class=\"mx-auto\"></span><div class=\"text-fg-1 dark:text-fgDark-1 text-sm prose-p:my-2\"><p>Valve does nothing and still wins.</p></div></div></div>\n        <p>One of the bigger things that I don't think people really appreciate about the Steam Machine (or even the Steam Deck for that matter) is that the freedom to install whatever program, framework, background service, or OS you want means that every Steam Machine can be used to make games. Some of their promotional images show a Steam Machine in a dual-monitor setup split between Blender and Godot.</p>\n        <p>I don't think you realize how big of a deal this is. By making every Steam Machine also powerful enough to do full on game development, Valve is making it so much easier to become an independent game developer. Just add ideas, skill, and time.</p>\n        <div class=\"flex space-x-2 bg-bg-soft dark:bg-bgDark-soft mx-auto min-h-fit\n        lg:w-[80ch] sm:w-[65ch] w-full\n        lg:p-4 p-2\n        // Base styles for all messages\n        mt-0 mb-0 rounded-none\n        // First message styles\n        first:mt-4 first:rounded-t-lg first:pb-2\n        // Last message styles\n        last:mb-4 last:rounded-b-lg last:pt-1\n        // Middle message top/bottom adjustment\n        [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-mt-[1px] [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:py-1\"><div class=\"h-16 not-prose\"><img alt=\"Cadey is aha\" class=\"h-16 w-16 rounded-xs\" src=\"https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/aha\" /></div><div class=\"flex-1 min-w-0\"><span class=\"font-semibold text-sm block mb-1\"><a href=\"https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey\">Cadey</a></span><span class=\"mx-auto\"></span><div class=\"text-fg-1 dark:text-fgDark-1 text-sm prose-p:my-2\"><p>Hilariously, this means that the Steam Machine is probably the only console on\n        the market that's fully compliant with the EU's Digital Markets Act. It would\n        be absolutely hilarious if the EU ends up using this as rationale for\n        Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony to open up their consoles for third party\n        developers.</p></div></div></div>\n        <p>Oh and to top it off, the internal storage is upgradable and can take full-size nvme drives. If you pop your microSD card out of your Steam Deck, you can put it into your Steam Machine and get all your games instantly. Reportedly the ram is user-upgradable too.</p>\n        <p>The only way that they could mess this up is with the pricing. The price will be what determines if this is a PS5 killer or a mid-range home theater PC that can do games decently well. Given the fact that Steam prints so much money, I'd expect the pricing to be super aggressive.</p>\n        <div class=\"flex space-x-2 bg-bg-soft dark:bg-bgDark-soft mx-auto min-h-fit\n        lg:w-[80ch] sm:w-[65ch] w-full\n        lg:p-4 p-2\n        // Base styles for all messages\n        mt-0 mb-0 rounded-none\n        // First message styles\n        first:mt-4 first:rounded-t-lg first:pb-2\n        // Last message styles\n        last:mb-4 last:rounded-b-lg last:pt-1\n        // Middle message top/bottom adjustment\n        [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-mt-[1px] [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:py-1\"><div class=\"h-16 not-prose\"><img alt=\"Cadey is enby\" class=\"h-16 w-16 rounded-xs\" src=\"https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/enby\" /></div><div class=\"flex-1 min-w-0\"><span class=\"font-semibold text-sm block mb-1\"><a href=\"https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey\">Cadey</a></span><span class=\"mx-auto\"></span><div class=\"text-fg-1 dark:text-fgDark-1 text-sm prose-p:my-2\"><p>Worst case, this would be a great home theatre PC. I'd rock it in my media\n        centre. It's going to run Plex, Twitch, and Youtube just fine.</p></div></div></div>\n        <h2>Steam Frame</h2>\n        <p>Valve also announced their successor to the Valve Index today, the <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamframe\">Steam Frame</a>, a standalone VR headset. It's basically a Meta Quest headset, but also a Steam Deck. They market it as being able to play VR and 2D games effortlessly. The weirdest thing about it is that it's running a 64 bit ARM CPU instead of a conventional AMD APU like the Steam Deck and Steam Machine. This means that SteamOS is going to be cross-architecture for the first time and they're going to use <a href=\"https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX\">FEX</a> to bridge the gap.</p>\n        <p>The big thing I want to see in practice is their implementation of foveated rendering. This beautiful hack abuses the fact that human eyes have the most sharpness and fidelity at the exact centre of your field of vision, whereas your peripheral vision is abysmal at it. This means that on average you only have to render about 10% of the frame at maximum quality for it to <em>feel</em> like it's running at full resolution all over the screen.</p>\n        <p>This should make the fact that the Frame is using a &quot;weaker&quot; CPU/GPU irrelevant. Games should look fine as long as they render the slice that needs to be in full quality fast enough.</p>\n        <p>Even more fun, they take advantage of the same tricks behind foveated rendering for streaming games from a PC or Steam Machine. This means that you get that same optically perfect quality but with even less latency because less data has to be transferred to hit your eyes.</p>\n        <div class=\"flex space-x-2 bg-bg-soft dark:bg-bgDark-soft mx-auto min-h-fit\n        lg:w-[80ch] sm:w-[65ch] w-full\n        lg:p-4 p-2\n        // Base styles for all messages\n        mt-0 mb-0 rounded-none\n        // First message styles\n        first:mt-4 first:rounded-t-lg first:pb-2\n        // Last message styles\n        last:mb-4 last:rounded-b-lg last:pt-1\n        // Middle message top/bottom adjustment\n        [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:-mt-[1px] [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:py-1\"><div class=\"h-16 not-prose\"><img alt=\"Cadey is hug\" class=\"h-16 w-16 rounded-xs\" src=\"https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/hug\" /></div><div class=\"flex-1 min-w-0\"><span class=\"font-semibold text-sm block mb-1\"><a href=\"https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey\">Cadey</a></span><span class=\"mx-auto\"></span><div class=\"text-fg-1 dark:text-fgDark-1 text-sm prose-p:my-2\"><p>I really want to see what this is like in practice. Reportedly there's no\n        perceptual difference between this setup and rendering games at 100% full\n        quality.</p></div></div></div>\n        <p>The Steam Frame ships with a USB dongle that lets you use the might of your gaming tower for low latency VR gaming. I'll need to see this in practice in order to have opinions. I think that in the worst case it can't possibly be any worse than it was streaming VR games to my Quest 2 over Wi-Fi. That was tolerable and viable for mid-level Beat Saber. I have confidence that it will at least be sufficient for high level Beat Saber gameplay.</p>\n        <p>Remember how I said that it's a Steam Deck in a headset? The Steam Frame runs full SteamOS. You can just boot it into a full KDE desktop and use it as a normal computer. I have no reason to doubt that every Steam Frame is also a development kit in the same way that the Steam Machine is also a development kit.</p>\n        <p>They also claim you can load arbitrary Android apps into the Steam Frame. I need to see this in action before I have opinions about it. It would be exceptionally funny if this meant you could take apps/games made for the Meta Quest and just plop them onto the Steam Frame without modification. I'm not holding my breath, but it would be funny.</p>\n        <p>The only possible flaw I can see is that the strap it ships with doesn't go over the top of your head. If this ends up being an issue in practice, somebody is going to make a third party strap that just fixes this problem. I'm not concerned.</p>\n        <p>Really, the only thing that can go wrong with any of this hardware is the price. I would still be happy if the pricing was the worst part of this lineup. It would be really cool if there was a bundle.</p>\n        <p>I'm at least planning on getting a Steam Machine on day 1 and making a review. What would you like to see in that?
