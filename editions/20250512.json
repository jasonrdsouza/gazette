That presents certain challenges. But our subject today is only how to give your thing a <em>title</em>.</p>\n\n<p>My advice is: Think of the title as \u201cclassifier\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>When people see the title, some are likely to click on it and some won\u2019t. Abstractly speaking, the title adds a second dimension to the above figure:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/titles/plot2.svg\" /></p>\n\n<p>A title has two goals. First, think of all the people in the world who, if they clicked on your thing, would finish it and love it. Ideally, those people would click. That is, you want there to be people in the like + click region:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/titles/plot3.svg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Other people will hate your thing. It\u2019s fine, some people hate everything. But if they click on your thing, they\u2019ll be annoyed and tell everyone you are dumb and bad. You don\u2019t want that. So you <em>don\u2019t</em> want people in the hate + click region.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/titles/plot4.svg\" /></p>\n\n<p>I find it helpful to think about all title-related issues from this perspective.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Everyone is deluged with content. Few people will <em>hate</em> your thing, because very few will care enough to have any feelings about it at all.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>The good news is that it\u2019s a big world and none of us are that unique. If you make a thing that <em>you</em> would love, then I guarantee you at least 0.0001% of other people would love it too. That\u2019s still 8000 people! The problem is finding them.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>That\u2019s hard. Because\u2014you don\u2019t like most things, right? So you start with a strong prior that most things are bad (for you). Life is short, so you only click on things when there\u2019s a very strong signal they\u2019ll be good (for you).</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Say you write a post about concrete. Should you call it, \u201cMy favorite concrete pozzolanic admixtures\u201d, even though 99.9% of people have no idea what pozzolanic means? Well, think of the people who\u2019d actually like your thing. Do <em>they</em> know? If so, use \u201cpozzolanic\u201d. That gives a strong signal to Concrete People: \u201cHey! This is for you! And you <em>know</em> I\u2019m not lying about that, because I\u2019ve driven away all the noobs.\u201d</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>So ideally you\u2019re aiming for something like this:</p>\n\n    <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/titles/plot5.svg\" /></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Be careful imitating famous people. If Barack Obama made a thing called \u201cThoughts on blockchain\u201d, everyone would read it, because the implicit title is \u201cThoughts on blockchain, <em>by Barack Goddamn Obama</em>\u201d. Most of the titles you see probably come from people who have some kind of established \u201cbrand\u201d. If you don\u2019t have that, you probably don\u2019t want to choose the same kind of titles.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>The title isn\u2019t just about the subject. I called this post, \u201cHow to title your blog post <em>or whatever</em>\u201d partly because I hope some of this applies to other things beyond blog posts. But mostly I did that because it signals that my style is breezy and informal. I think people really underrate this.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Some people choose clever punny titles. If you have a big audience that reads all your things, then your title doesn\u2019t need to be a good classifier. I\u2019m not in that situation, but I sometimes find a pun so amusing that I can\u2019t resist. <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/fahren-height/\">\u201cFahren-height\u201d</a> was worth it. <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/taste-games/\">\u201cTaste games\u201d</a> was not.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Traditional advice says that you should put your main \u201cmessage\u201d in the title. I have mixed feelings about that. On the one hand, it provides a lot of signal. On the other hand, it seems to get people\u2019s hackles up. The world is full of bad things that basically pick a conclusion and ignore or distort all conflicting evidence. If you\u2019re attempting to be fair or nuanced, putting your conclusion in the title might signal that you\u2019re going to be a typical biased/bad thing. It will <em>definitely</em> lead to lots of comments \u201crefuting\u201d you from people who didn\u2019t read your thing.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Putting your conclusion in the title may also ruin your \u201cstory\u201d. Though you should ask: Do the people who\u2019d like your thing really care about your story?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>A difficult case is things that create new \u201clabels\u201d. Sometimes there\u2019s an idea floating around, and we need someone to make a canonical thing with a Name. To serve that role, the thing\u2019s title needs to be that name. This presents a trade-off. A post titled <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/D7PumeYTDPfBTp3i7/the-waluigi-effect-mega-post\">\u201cThe Waluigi Effect\u201d</a> is great for people who want to know what that is, but terrible for everyone else.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>For the best <em>title</em> ever I nominate, <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/im-worried-about-chicago\">\u201cI\u2019m worried about Chicago\u201d</a>. It doesn\u2019t look fancy, but do you see how elegantly it balances all the above issues?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>You\u2019d think that, by 2025, technology would have solved the problem of things getting to people. I think it\u2019s the opposite. Social media is optimized to keep people engaged and does not want people leaving the walled garden. Openly prohibiting links would cause a revolt, so instead they go as close as people will tolerate. Which, it turns out, is pretty close.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Boring titles are OK. I know that no one will click on <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/links-2/\">\u201cLinks for April\u201d</a> who doesn\u2019t already follow me. But I think that\u2019s fine, because I don\u2019t think anyone else would like it.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Consider title-driven thing creation. That is, consider <em>first</em> choosing a title and <em>then</em> creating a thing that delivers on the title. It\u2019s sad to admit, but I think there are many good things that simply don\u2019t have good titles. Consider not making those things. The cynical view of this is that without a good title, no one will read your thing, so why bother? The optimistic view is that we\u2019re all drowning in content, so what the world actually needs is good things that can find their way to the people who will benefit from them. In practice, it\u2019s often something in the middle: You start to create your thing, <em>then</em> you choose a title, then you structure your thing to deliver on the title.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>My favorite thing category is \u201cLucid examination of all sides of an issue which finds some evidence pointing in various directions and doesn\u2019t reach a definitive conclusion because the world is complicated\u201d. Some people make fun of me for spending so much time researching seed oils and then lamely calling my thing <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/seed-oil/\">\u201cThoughts on seed oil\u201d</a>. But what should I have called that instead? Lots of bloggers create things in this category, and no one seems to have solved the problem.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>[Insert joke about how bad the title of this post is.]</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>"

                "<p>I just noticed an interesting question that I&#8217;ve never heard anyone ask. To explain it, I need to review the basics of behavior, and of abstraction levels.</p><p>First, we explain agent behavior in terms of agent choices and the actual states of the world. Standard decision theory explains choices in terms of beliefs and preferences, also known as goals or motives, some of which are conscious, and others unconscious. Beliefs are explained using info and priors. Deviations from standard decision theory are often well explained in terms of random noise and habits, which come from patterns of prior choices by this agent and others this agent has observed. Thus agent behavior is explained in terms of noise, the world, and agent info, priors, habits, and motives both conscious and unconscious.</p><p>Second, construal level or &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/near-far-summaryhtml?utm_source=publication-search\">near-far</a>&#8221; theory, which I&#8217;ve discussed often, says that human behavior varies greatly with level of abstraction. That is, some behavior is on very small units of time and space, and driven by very local goals and considerations, while other behavior is driven by very broad stable goals and considerations, and made regarding large units of time and space. For example, re traveling to work one makes many small choices that adjust one&#8217;s legs or a car steering wheel, intermediate choices about which routes to take, and big choices about what time of day to drive and where to work.</p><p>Okay, here is the interesting question: <em>how does the relative explanatory power of noise, world, info, priors, habits, and motives vary with choice level of abstraction?</em></p><p>Very small scale choices are mostly made unconsciously. They seem roughly explained by the world, our info and our nearby conscious immediate goals. But noise, unconscious goals, and learned habits also seem to make big contributions. For example, our body language is driven by status considerations that we&#8217;d deny, and experts can often find more efficient ways to achieve our goals than our habits achieve.</p><p>Mid scale choices seem especially well explained by our info and conscious goals, with less room for explanation by noise, unconscious goals, and habits. These are the choices that we mention when telling stories about our events, and for which our languages are well designed. We are quite ready and able to explain that we went to the grocery story because we needed some groceries, and that we drove because it was too hot to walk. We locked the door to deter thieves, and we called the police on a thief because that&#8217;s what good citizens do. And such explanations do in fact account rather well for our specific choices at that level of abstraction.</p><p>In contrast, compared to noise and habits, our info and conscious goals seem to do much worse at explaining our high level choices, such as of where to live, which jobs to take, which people to marry, or which laws and norms to enforce in which ways. Our book <em><a href=\"http://elephantinthebrain.com\">The Elephant in the </a></em>Brain shows how unconscious goals often do a much better job explaining many broad behaviors, like going to school or the doctor. And critics like <a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/what-would-socrates-do\">Socrates</a> have long shown how easy it is to find incoherence in the habits and rationales of our high level choices.</p><p>Why do our conscious motives do so much better a good job of explaining mid level choices, compared to smaller or larger scale choices? Re smaller choices a standard answer is that conscious thinking requires a large overhead that isn&#8217;t worth the bother for smaller scale choices. And re larger choices a standard answer is that we make those choices a lot less often, and so get a lot less personal data on which to base them.</p><p>Yet our societies contain vast numbers of people making rather similar large scale choices; why can&#8217;t we learn from those? I think a better explanation here is that our larger scale choices are much more strongly set by cultural evolution. We copy the habits of associates, even when such habits are not especially coherent. Then we make up incoherent rationales to justify them, These inherited habits are specified at some modestly high level of abstraction, and implemented via conscious calculation, which is what makes our intermediate scale choices so well explained by our conscious goals.</p><p>In a faster changing world, habits encoded at overly low levels of abstraction run real risks of not generalizing well to new environments. For this reason, we moderns, living in a faster changing world, have increased the level of abstraction at which we infer and encode our inherited behavioral habits. Alas, this makes it harder to reliably infer habits from observed behaviors, creating more risks of cultural drift.</p><p>Worse, &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/sincerity-adds-to-drift\">sincerity</a>&#8221; describes a modern pattern of trying to modify our habit ideals to be more easily explained by a simple set of ideal motives, such as true love, true patriotism, or truly saved. This might, if successful, make our high level choices as coherently justified, and as well explained by conscious motives, as our mid level choices. We might then feel satisfyingly rational.</p><p>However, such modified habits would plausibly fail to inherit a great deal of the adaptiveness info embodied in unmodified habits, risking even more cultural drift. At any one moment the process of natural selection offers an incoherent mishmash of inherited habits that are nevertheless more adaptive than would be a far more coherent great simplification of them. Here a foolish consistency is indeed the hobgoblin of little minds.</p>"

            "summary": "<p>I just noticed an interesting question that I&#8217;ve never heard anyone ask. To explain it, I need to review the basics of behavior, and of abstraction levels.</p><p>First, we explain agent behavior in terms of agent choices and the actual states of the world. Standard decision theory explains choices in terms of beliefs and preferences, also known as goals or motives, some of which are conscious, and others unconscious. Beliefs are explained using info and priors. Deviations from standard decision theory are often well explained in terms of random noise and habits, which come from patterns of prior choices by this agent and others this agent has observed. Thus agent behavior is explained in terms of noise, the world, and agent info, priors, habits, and motives both conscious and unconscious.</p><p>Second, construal level or &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/near-far-summaryhtml?utm_source=publication-search\">near-far</a>&#8221; theory, which I&#8217;ve discussed often, says that human behavior varies greatly with level of abstraction. That is, some behavior is on very small units of time and space, and driven by very local goals and considerations, while other behavior is driven by very broad stable goals and considerations, and made regarding large units of time and space.
