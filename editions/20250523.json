                "<p>This month\u2019s update spans the full range of work we do at Ink & Switch. We have some major updates to our open-source Automerge library, an introduction to Sketchy Calendars, and a peek at our ongoing work on collaboration tools for game development. We\u2019re also excited to share a refreshed website for the lab and a talk by our director about how we work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-automerge-releases\"><a class=\"plain\" href=\"https://www.inkandswitch.com/index.xml#new-automerge-releases\">New Automerge releases</a></h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve recently released some major updates for <a href=\"https://automerge.org/\">Automerge</a>, the open source CRDT-based data synchronization library that we develop at Ink & Switch.</p>\n<p><strong>Automerge 3.0 Beta:</strong> Automerge 3.0 is an architectural overhaul that radically improves performance. Historically, Automerge compressed large histories on disk, but didn\u2019t use the compressed format in memory. For this release, Orion Henry re-implemented Automerge to use the on-disk columnar compression format in memory; the result is memory savings of 100x in some cases, and much faster document load times. We\u2019re seeing huge benefits in our internal deployments!</p>\n<p>Alongside the performance improvement, we\u2019ve also taken the opportunity to do a major version bump and fix some awkward parts of the API which were a result of maintaining backwards compatibility.</p>\n<p>This is a big change, so we\u2019re rolling it out slowly. We\u2019ve run fuzz tests and have been successfully using it internally; we\u2019ve also been working with the Automerge community to make sure it\u2019s stable and fast in their usage. We\u2019re confident enough now to release a beta. Please <a href=\"https://github.com/automerge/automerge/blob/e18161834c271800e07d9b0d065db0670f141a40/README.md#30-beta\">kick the tires</a> and report back to us!</p>\n<p><strong>Automerge Repo 2.0</strong>: We have also released a new major version of Automerge Repo, the networking and storage adapter library for Automerge. We\u2019ve cleaned up APIs to require less boilerplate, improved handling of asynchronous loading states, made progress reporting better, added more convenient helpers for history and diffing, and more. See the <a href=\"https://automerge.org/blog/2025/05/13/automerge-repo-2/\">announcement blog post</a> for more details.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sketchy-calendar\"><a class=\"plain\" href=\"https://www.inkandswitch.com/index.xml#sketchy-calendar\">Sketchy Calendar</a></h2>\n<p>When it comes to calendars, you can choose between using a digital calendar app or getting a paper calendar. They both allow you to keep track of things like doctor appointments, work meetings or birthdays, so you can keep a clear head and be sure that you won\u2019t forget anything. But while the two approaches may seem similar on the surface, they\u2019re radically different in the kinds of trade-offs they make.</p>\n<p>Lab researchers Marcel Goethals and Paul Sonnentag have begun exploring what it would mean to have a calendar that combines the convenience of a digital calendar with the simplicity and expressivity you get from pen & paper. Find out more in their <a href=\"https://www.inkandswitch.com/ink/notes/sketchy-calendar/\">introductory lab note</a>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"A sneak peek at a Sketchy Calendar\" src=\"https://www.inkandswitch.com/newsletter/dispatch-011/sketchy-calendar.png\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"seeking-godot-game-devs\"><a class=\"plain\" href=\"https://www.inkandswitch.com/index.xml#seeking-godot-game-devs\">Seeking Godot game devs</a></h2>\n<p>Over the past few months, we\u2019ve been working with the <a href=\"https://www.endlessos.org/\">Endless Foundation</a> to prototype a new approach to collaboration in game development: live and asynchronous collaboration, with branches and diffs, all built right into the open-source Godot game engine.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a sneak preview:</p>\n<figure>\n<video controls=\"controls\" loop=\"loop\" preload=\"metadata\" src=\"https://www.inkandswitch.com/newsletter/dispatch-011/godot-sizzle.mp4\"></video>\n</figure>\n<p><strong>We\u2019re now seeking people with Godot game development experience to test out an early prototype</strong>. <a href=\"https://forms.gle/9MNsGmpifG4WP2JE9\">Sign up here</a> if you\u2019re interested. Or, if you know anyone who does Godot development, we\u2019d appreciate you sharing this link with them!</p>\n<h2 id=\"website-updates\"><a class=\"plain\" href=\"https://www.inkandswitch.com/index.xml#website-updates\">Website updates</a></h2>\n<p>We recently shipped a major expansion to the <a href=\"https://www.inkandswitch.com\">Ink & Switch website</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to our essays and lab notebooks, you\u2019ll now find landing pages for our four primary research areas\u2014local-first software, programmable ink, malleable software, and universal version control\u2014each sporting a newly designed logo. On these landing pages you can learn more about the ongoing themes present across our work, and then dig deeper into summary pages for each of our projects, some of which are being shared publicly for the first time.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Each research area like Programmable Ink now has its own landing page.\" src=\"https://www.inkandswitch.com/newsletter/dispatch-011/programmable-ink.png\" /></p>\n<p>On our home page, you\u2019ll also find a sampling of upcoming events and appearances by our researchers, and \u2014\u00a0answering one of our most frequently-asked questions \u2014\u00a0information about how our research is funded and how you can get involved.</p>\n<p>This update goes a bit deeper than just the launch of new pages. We\u2019ve also replaced our old site engine, Hugo, with a new system developed in-house that makes it easier for us to experiment with new ideas for the form and content of the site. Our <a href=\"https://www.inkandswitch.com/ink/notes/\">notebook for Programmable Ink</a>, for instance, is continually evolving as we find new ways to share this work as it unfolds.</p>\n<p>So set aside some time to browse around and see what\u2019s new, and subscribe to <a href=\"https://www.inkandswitch.com/index.xml\">our RSS feed</a> to be notified whenever anything is published to the site. Of course, we\u2019ll also keep sharing updates on our work right here in the Dispatch newsletter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-do-ambitious-research-in-the-modern-era\"><a class=\"plain\" href=\"https://www.inkandswitch.com/index.xml#how-to-do-ambitious-research-in-the-modern-era\">How to Do Ambitious Research in the Modern Era</a></h2>\n<p>We don\u2019t often talk about how we work: we try to let our work speak for itself.</p>\n<p>Still, if you\u2019re the kind of person who finds the \u201cbehind-the-scenes\u201d view of research interesting, you might enjoy this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7DVlI_Ztq8\">talk at the Nemertes [next] conference</a> by our lab director, Peter van Hardenberg. He talks through the mechanics of operating an independent research lab, connecting academia and industry, recruiting, and thinking about research like a revolutionary.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re interested less in the \u201chow\u201d and more in the \u201cwhat\u201d of cutting edge research, consider starting with Itai Cohen\u2019s talk from the Nemertes conference about his group\u2019s work on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74hT4NUxxAs&amp;list=PLAVYUVo7a3NO23nyHnMndn8S_fvriHEY\">Electrically Integrated Autonomous Microscopic Robots</a>.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s it for this month\u2014until next time!</p>"

They claim that their consciousness <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/10/21/the-pnse-paper/\">switches from one mode to another</a> at a specific moment that they vividly remember forever after (and which isn&#8217;t linked to any behavioral changes that casual observers can notice!)</p><p>All the examples in this post are Twitter randos trying to recall 20+ year old events - the least reliable possible data source this side of a peer-reviewed social science paper.

            "summary": "<p>Today&rsquo;s my last day at Carta, where I got the chance to serve as their CTO for the past two years. I&rsquo;ve learned <em>so much</em> working there, and I wanted to end my chapter there by collecting my thoughts on what I learned. (I am heading somewhere, and will share news in a week or two after firming up the communication plan with my new team there.)</p> <p>The most important things I learned at Carta were:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Working in the details</strong> &ndash; if you took a critical lens towards my historical leadership style, I think the biggest issue you&rsquo;d point at is my being too comfortable operating at a high level of abstraction. Utilizing the expertise of others to fill in your gaps is a valuable skill, but&ndash;like any single approach&ndash;it&rsquo;s limiting when utilized too frequently.</p> <p>One of the strengths of Carta&rsquo;s &ldquo;house leadership style&rdquo; is expecting leaders to go deep into the details to get informed and push pace. What I practiced there turned into the pieces on <a href=\"https://lethain.com/testing-strategy-iterative-refinement/\">strategy testing</a> and <a href=\"https://lethain.com/domain-expertise/\">developing domain expertise</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Refining my approach to engineering strategy</strong> &ndash; over the past 18 months, I&rsquo;ve written a book on engineering strategy (posts",

Instead of doing that, I would rather you <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/Xe\">support the project</a> and purchase a license for the commercial variant of Anubis named <a href=\"https://gist.within.lgbt/xe/ed3282f1cc064c56bcbb1a74f6a13be2\">BotStopper</a>. Doing this will make sure that the project is sustainable and that I don't burn myself out to a crisp in the process of keeping small internet websites open to the public.</p>\n        <p>At some level, I use the presence of the Anubis mascot as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_cart_theory\">&quot;shopping cart test&quot;</a>. If you either pay me for the unbranded version or leave the character intact, I'm going to take any bug reports more seriously. It's a positive sign that you are willing to invest in the project's success and help make sure that people developing vital infrastructure are not neglected.</p>\n        <p>There's been some online venom and vitriol about the use of a cartoon that people only for about 3 seconds on average that make me wonder if I should have made this code open source in the first place. The anime image is load-bearing. It is there as a social cost. You are free to replace it, but I am also free to make parts of the program rely on the presence of the anime image in order to do more elaborate checks, such as checks that do not rely on JavaScript.</p>\n        <p>Amusingly, this has caused some issues with the education market because they want a solution NOW and their purchasing process is a very slow and onerous beast. I'm going to figure out a balance eventually, but who knew that the satirical tech startup I made up as a joke would end up having a solid foothold in the education market?</p>\n        <p>One of best side effects of the character being there is that it's functioned as a bit of a viral marketing campaign for the project. Who knows how many people learned that Anubis is there, functional, and works well enough for people to complain about because of someone getting incensed online about the fact that the software shows a human-authored work of art for a few seconds?</p>\n        <p>I want this project to be sustainable; and in the wake of rent, food prices, and computer hardware costs continuing to go up I kinda need money because our economy runs on money, not GitHub stars.</p>\n        <p>I have a no-JS solution that should be ready soon (I've been doing a lot of unpublishable reverse engineering of how browsers work), but I also need to figure out how to obfuscate it so that the scrapers can't just look at the code to fix their scrapers. So far I'm looking at WebAssembly on the server for this. I'll let y'all know more as I have it figured out on my end. There will be some fun things in the near future, including but not limited to <a href=\"https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/pull/533\">external services to help Anubis make better decisions on when to throw or not throw challenges</a>.</p>\n        <p>Hopefully the NLNet application I made goes through, funding to buy a few months of development time would go a long way. There has been venture capital interest in Anubis, so that's a potential route to go down too.</p>\n        <p>Thanks for following the development of Anubis! If you want to support the project, please throw me <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/Xe\">some bucks on GitHub Sponsors</a>.</p>"
