                "<p>Here&rsquo;s a thought experiment for pondering the effects AI might have on society: What if we invented teleportation?</p>\n\n<p>A bit odd, I know, but bear with me&hellip;</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The year is 2035. The Auto Go Instant (AGI) teleporter has been invented. You can now go anywhere&hellip; instantly!</p>\n\n<p>At first the tech is expensive and unreliable. Critics laugh. &ldquo;Hah, look at these stupid billionaires who can&rsquo;t spend a minute of their time moving around like the rest of us. And 5% of the time they end up in the wrong place, LOL&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>But soon things get cheaper and better. The tech hits mass market.</p>\n\n<p>There are huge benefits. Global commerce is supercharged. Instead of commuting, people can spend more time with family and friends. Pollution is way down. The AGI company runs a sweet commercial of people teleporting to see their parents one last time before they die.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, some weird things start happening.</p>\n\n<p>The landscape starts reconfiguring around the new reality. Families move to remote cabins, just seconds away from urban amenities. The summit of Mt. Everest becomes crowded with influencers. (It turns out that if you stay just a few seconds, you can take a quick selfie without needing an oxygen mask!)</p>\n\n<p>Physical health takes a hit for many people. It&rsquo;s harder to justify walking or biking when you could just be there now.</p>\n\n<p>In-between moments disappear. One moment you&rsquo;re at work, the next you&rsquo;re at your dinner table at home. No more time to reset or prepare for a new context.</p>\n\n<p>But the biggest change is the loss of serendipity. When you teleport, you decide in advance where you&rsquo;re headed. You never run into an old friend on the street, or stop at a farmstand by the side of the road, or see a store you might want to stop into someday.</p>\n\n<p>To modern teenagers, the idea of wandering out without an exact destination in mind becomes unthinkable. You start with the GPS coordinates, and then you just&hellip; go.</p>\n\n<p>Advocates of the new way point out that there&rsquo;s nothing stopping anyone from choosing traditional methods for fun. And indeed, the cross-country road trip does see a mild resurgence as a hipster thing.</p>\n\n<p>But when push comes to shove, most people struggle to make the time for wandering\u2014our schedules are now arranged around an assumption of instant transport.</p>\n\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t exactly to say that the old way was better. Most people can agree that teleportation a net win. Yet for those who remember, there&rsquo;s a vague unease, a sense that something important was lost in the world&hellip;.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>In his book Technology and the Character of Everyday Life, the philosopher Albert Borgmann talks about wooden stoves in houses.</p>\n\n<p>What is a stove? Yes, it warms the house&hellip; but it&rsquo;s also so much more than that. You gotta cut the wood, you gotta start the fire in the morning&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;A stove used to furnish more than mere warmth. It was a focus, a hearth, a place that gathered the work and leisure of a family and gave the house of a center.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>When you switch to a modern central heating system, you cut out all these inconveniences. Fantastic!</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and by the way, your family social life is totally different&hellip;.. wait what?? Yes, the inconveniences were inconvenient. But they were also holding up something in your life and culture, and now they&rsquo;re suddenly gone.</p>\n\n<p>I think of this as kind of a Chesteron&rsquo;s fence on hard mode. Yes, the stove was put there for warmth, that was the main goal. But you should also think hard about its secondary effects before replacing it.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>OK so&hellip; how does this apply to AI?</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m personally excited about AI and think it can improve our lives in a lot of ways. But at the same time I&rsquo;m trying to be mindful of secondary effects and unintended consequences.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s one example. If your mental model of reading is &ldquo;transmit facts into my head&rdquo;, then reading an AI summary of something might seem like a more efficient way to get that task done.</p>\n\n<p>But if your mental model of reading is &ldquo;spend time marinating in a world of ideas&rdquo;, then reducing the time spent reading doesn&rsquo;t help you much.</p>\n\n<p>The point was the journey you underwent while reading, and you replaced it with teleportation.</p>\n\n<p>Another example. One of the great joys of my life is having nerdy friends explain things to me. Now I can get explanations from AI with less friction, anytime, anywhere, with endless follow-up.</p>\n\n<p>Even if the AI explanations are &ldquo;better&rdquo;, there&rsquo;s a social cost. I can try to mindfully nudge myself to still ask people questions, but now it requires more effort.</p>\n\n<p>Final example: I&rsquo;m trying to be mindful of the effects of vibe coding when designing software interfaces. On the one hand, it can really speed up my iteration loop and help me explore more ideas.</p>\n\n<p>But at the same time, part of my design process is sitting with the details of the thing and uncovering it as I go\u2014more a muscle memory process than a conscious plan. Messing with this process can change the results in ways that are hard to predict!</p>\n\n<p>I guess the throughline for all of these examples is: sometimes the friction and inconvenience is where the good stuff happens. Gotta be very careful removing it.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The takeaway here isn&rsquo;t that &ldquo;AI is bad&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll just say that I&rsquo;m personally trying to be mindful about keeping good friction around.</p>\n\n<p>During COVID, we kinda got teleportation via Zoom for a while. I decided to &ldquo;virtual commute&rdquo; every day, walking around the block to get some fresh air and a reset before/after work. This wasn&rsquo;t a big deal but I found it really helpful.</p>\n\n<p>As AI makes a lot of things easier, it&rsquo;ll be interesting to ponder what kinds of new frictions we&rsquo;ll want to intentionally add to our lives. Teleportation isn&rsquo;t always the best answer&hellip;</p>"

This is because <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_effect\" target=\"_blank\">defaults matter</a>.

This is mostly because the value-exchange with Apple is clear: You give them money, and in return they give you good hardware and software, and a commitment to privacy.</p>\n<p>With Google this relationship is more nebulous. Google gives you a free search engine, free email, free document editing and storage, a free browser, free maps, and a bunch of other useful services; but the money comes from...elsewhere. It comes from influencing your buying decisions, and selling your data and attention to marketers; along with a whole host of privacy and security infringements along the way.</p>\n<p>I understand why Google paid Apple all that money. Not only does it send lots of high value traffic to Google, but it also disincentivises Apple from creating their own search engine and competing with Google in this space.</p>\n<p>Yet Apple is also the company that runs ads like this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"apple-privacy\" src=\"https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman/apple-privacy.webp\" /></p>\n<p>By accepting Alphabet's money, Apple essentially sold their user-base to Google. They paid lip-service to privacy until commercial interests dictated otherwise. If Google was the default search engine without money changing hands, Apple could argue that they just selected the best or most-popular search engine. But because that spot was bought and paid for, it's a big black mark on their commitment to privacy.</p>\n<p>Complaining about corporate interests chasing profit aside, here's my hot take: If Apple really cared about privacy, not only should they choose a different search engine, they should block ads and trackers in Safari by default.</p>\n<p>There are other browsers that do this; and it's fairly trivial to set up an <a href=\"https://adguard.com\" target=\"_blank\">ad-blocker</a> in Safari yourself. But so few people do. Every now and then I find myself on one of those content-y websites without an ad-blocker, and it feels like I've entered a casino on crack\u2014with animated banners, sliders, and flashing ads interspersing the content.</p>\n<p>Seizure-inducing websites aside, advertising-driven tracking is a privacy nightmare, as is the personal-data-economy that underpins it all.</p>\n<p>Here's the thing: Apple could do this tomorrow. They could easily make Safari block ads by default. And yet they don't, despite it not being in their user's best interests. This would cripple Google, true; but it's asymmetric. As far as I can tell, Apple doesn't rely on Google for anything. Yet there's nothing illegal about Apple blocking ads and trackers by default. Hell, I'm surprised the EU hasn't mandated it yet.</p>\n<p>And Google isn't even paying them $20 billion a year to prevent this!</p>\n<p>So if there're any higher-ups at Apple who read my blog, hello!</p>\n<p>I'm not suggesting Apple go full nuclear right away, but this should at the very least be part of the conversation around what respecting users and their privacy means.</p>\n<p>And if Apple does pull this off, I'll finally believe the billboards.</p>"

                "<p>The purported main purpose of school, and even of childhood, is educating children.</p>\n<p>Many people are actively opposed to this idea.</p>\n<p>Either they have other priorities that matter more, or sometimes they outright think that your child learning things is bad and you should feel bad for wanting that.</p>\n<p>Some even say it openly. They actively and openly want to stop your child from learning things, and want to put your child into settings where they will not learn things. And they say that this is good.</p>\n<p>Or they simply assert that the primary point of education is as a positional good, where what matters is your relative standing. And then they pretend this doesn\u2019t imply they both should and are going around preventing children from learning.</p>\n<div>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-24711\"></span>\n\n\n</div>\n<p>In other places, we simply epicly fail at education and don\u2019t seem to care. Or education \u2018experts\u2019 claim that things that obviously work don\u2019t work, or things that obviously don\u2019t work, do work.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">An Introductory Example</h4>\n\n\n<p>Consider this section some combination of peek into this alternative universe of thought and the fun of multiple meta levels of shooting fish in a barrel?</p>\n<p>I present, <a href=\"https://x.com/gtmom/status/1965082489950802003\">HT to Pamela Hobart who makes many of the same points</a>: Freddie DeBoer writes the long \u2018<a href=\"https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/education-doesnt-work-30\">Education Doesn\u2019t Work 3.0</a>\u2019 which is \u2018a comprehensive argument that education cannot close academic gaps.\u2019</p>\n<p>What? Was it supposed to do that? Would you want it to?</p>\n<p>Very obviously the only way to close academic gaps fully is to go all handicapper general and ban bright kids from getting educations. Thus, The War on Education.</p>\n<p>Freddie starts off saying we can\u2019t admit some kids aren\u2019t smart, and some kids will naturally do better at school than others, to which I say you just admitted it, and I\u2019m happy to admit it, and everyone I talk to is willing to admit it, so who is this mysterious we. It is, presumably, a Certain Type of Guy who is an \u2018education expert\u2019 of some kind and presumably has a maximum of one child who has gone to school.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Freddie DeBoer: Our educational debates are largely useless because most people engaged in those debates assume out of hand that, absent unusual circumstances like severe neglect or abuse or the presence of developmental or cognitive disabilities, any student can be taught to any level of academic success, and any failure to induce academic success in students is the result of some sort of unfortunate error.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well, it depends.</p>\n<p>If you mean \u2018those debates\u2019 as in those between those \u2018education experts\u2019? Then perhaps yes, they make these types of absurdly stupid assumptions. If you mean \u2018debates among actual regular humans,\u2019 then no. Obviously not. One would question whether Freddie has met such people.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Education can raise the <em>absolute performance</em> of most students modestly, but it almost never meaningfully reshuffles the <em>relative</em> distribution of ability and achievement.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Um, again, what exactly were we trying to do? Educate the children? Or make sure we don\u2019t educate the children? Half and half?</p>\n<p>I mean, I guess Freddie then does a job repeatedly exposing \u2018the contradictions\u2019 as it were in the entire equality project, but the barrel already has a lot of bullet holes, the water is leaking and the fish are dead.</p>\n<p>So we get more fun lines like this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We have spent an immense amount of effort, manpower, time, and treasure on forcing students to meet procrustean academic standards, despite the fact that we have overwhelming evidence that their relative performance is largely fixed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yes, obviously, also yes the extra money is mostly being wasted but even if it wasn\u2019t the whole point was presumably to (drum roll) educate the children.</p>\n<p>Why in the world would we spend tons of resources and time on relative education, which by definition is zero sum and a red queen\u2019s race? That doesn\u2019t make sense. There\u2019s a fixed amount of relative education.</p>\n<blockquote><p>At the end of this essay, I will argue that education is important, does matter, and is worth funding &#8211; but that what\u2019s now assumed to be its primary purpose, moving students around in quantitative educational metrics, is actually what education does worst.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Who thought that was its primary purpose, either the metrics or the thing itself?</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the reason this was brought to my attention is that his \u2018absolute learning has value\u2019 t-shirt is raising questions supposedly answered by the shirt:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>What This Essay Does Not Argue:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>That absolute learning (that is, learning as measured against a standard or benchmark or criterion) has no value; rather, relative learning is practically and morally dominant in these discussions because only relative learning (sometimes discussed in terms of educational mobility) can better one\u2019s economic fortunes, and it is that potential that underlies our entire modern educational debates and the reason for obsession with achievement gaps.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The next section is \u2018I Assure You, You Do Care About Relative Learning.\u2019</p>\n<p>I assure him that I don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>His first argument is that relative learning indicates absolute learning. That is true but saying this means therefore you care about relative learning (checkmate, liberals?) is not how logic or words work. Caring about the territory does not mean you care about the (not very accurate) map.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Second, while I am happy to concede that absolute learning happens all the time, this should not be mistaken for saying that absolute learning is easily achieved, reliable, or consistent.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I don\u2019t understand why this is supposed to be a relevant argument here. It seems like he\u2019s saying I care about [X], but actually [X] is hard, so instead I care about [Y]?</p>\n<blockquote><p>Most importantly, though, is a simple reality: the <em>consequences </em>of education are derived from relative performance, not absolute.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>In the vast majority of scenarios where education is relevant, applicants of whatever type are being evaluated relative to peers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There\u2019s saying the quiet part out loud, and then there\u2019s this.</p>\n<p>The purpose of education is\u2026 to do well on applications?</p>\n<p>He concedes that one might learn to drive and then use this skill to usefully operate a moving vehicle, but says this type of education is rare &#8211; that most education has no actual use whatsoever, other than as a positional good to grab a larger share of stuff.</p>\n<p>Then he goes through that schools are \u2018not guilty\u2019 because improving educational outcomes is impossible anyway. Transferring does nothing. Charter schools don\u2019t work. Interventions don\u2019t work (literally \u201cNothing \u201cWorks\u201d\u201d), full null hypothesis.</p>\n<p>All right, so now we have a section \u2018So What Should We Do?\u2019</p>\n<p>Very obviously, if you actually believed all that, you would want to dramatically reduce spending, both in money and in the time of children, on school, since school is almost entirely about relative position. Spending more on school, trying to achieve more or improve performance, in this model, is a defection against everyone else. So we should ban attempts to educate children, beyond some basic skills, and focus on practical stuff like learning to drive. Completely reorient childhood.</p>\n<p>So having pre registered that, let\u2019s see what he recommends.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Improve air quality. Okay, sure, that is one of the somethings that work, although again I don\u2019t understand why he thinks improving performance is good.</li>\n<li>Lower our educational standards. Don\u2019t make kids learn (for example) abstract math. Yes, that makes perfect sense for Freddie, if the learning is useless, you shouldn\u2019t require it. Again, if he is right then we should go farther, and ban such learning. Why are we letting kids engage in a zero sum competition?</li>\n<li>Soft tracking. Again, good idea, not sure what it has to do with the post.</li>\n<li>Invest in a robust safety net. Maybe? That\u2019s a different department.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Then he tries to pivot back to \u2018actually education matters.\u2019</p>\n<blockquote><p>Education creates the conditions for children and young adults to discover ideas, literature, science, and art that might otherwise remain inaccessible.</p>\n<p>It provides the structured time and social environment where curiosity can blossom, where students can learn how to think about problems that don\u2019t have easy answers, and where they can build lasting relationships with peers and mentors.</p>\n<p>The point of school, then, is not to guarantee that every child climbs into the top decile of performance but to offer each student the chance to cultivate knowledge, resilience, and imagination in ways that enrich their lives.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So absolute learning of something does matter after all, then. I mean, this description does not match what I know about actual schools, nor would I design anything like a current school if those were the goals. And he doesn\u2019t seem interested in a redesign or asking how to maximize the things that he thinks matter. But hey.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, here\u2019s the top comment, so yes things do get pretty insane:</p>\n<blockquote><p>James K: This is what I pay you for, Freddie, thank you for being so clear-headed about this topic.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been teaching for 16 years now and it boggles my mind that the band teacher can literally get on stage and say &#8220;We have the beginner, intermediate, and advanced band for you&#8221; and of course the baseball team can be divided into Varsity and JV, but I am not allowed to say that some kids are not smart enough to handle my AP classes because this means I don&#8217;t BELIEVE IN THEM or am supporting TRACKING (always said in the tones people reserve for the words &#8216;eugenics&#8217; or &#8216;segregation&#8217;).</p></blockquote>\n<p>I mean, yes. It means you support tracking because tracking is good. It means you don\u2019t believe in them in the sense that you don\u2019t believe in things that aren\u2019t real.</p>\n<p>So no, in that sense Freddie isn\u2019t arguing with a strawman. Which means that the entire system of education is being run by people who are at war with education.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Total Failure</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thefp.com/p/high-schooler-graduates-illiterate-sues-tennessee-school\">A Tennessee teen is suing his school</a> for \u2018compensatory education\u2019 after graduating with a 3.4 GPA, but being unable to read, or even spell his own name, and the school system has the audacity to defend against that lawsuit.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But the school took no action, the suit says, other than giving him 24 hours to complete his assignments.</p>\n<p>But even this \u201csolution\u201d was a problem. Because when William was at home with his schoolwork, he relied on AI programs like ChatGPT and Grammarly to complete his assignments for him, according to the judge who ruled on his suit last week.

That\u2019s less than a fifth of a standard deviation. This is nothing, if anything this shows that Covid didn\u2019t change things much?</p>\n<p>The comments section of Scott\u2019s post is full of despair about classroom conditions getting worse, shifts to teaching strategies that don\u2019t work (see the Mississippi reforms but in reverse), discipline collapsing and teachers having no tools if kids don\u2019t play along, many teachers quitting, chronic absenteeism happening and being accepted and tolerated, and many families not prioritizing education, on top of the continuing trends involving smartphones. That\u2019s on top of the obvious \u2018Covid took away a lot of schooling\u2019 concern that Scott starts with.</p>\n<p>What seems more meaningful than the overall smaller drop is the widening gap between low and high performers, another trend predating Covid. Scott has several graphs showing this, and I am convinced this is real, with a variety of causes. If you are properly equipped and motivated, you can avoid the pitfalls described above, and you have access to the entire web and world and a lot of new resources, now even including AI.

They tried to pass a law to fix some of this. The schools fought back.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/tracewoodgrains/status/1950336426928984365\">Tracing Woods</a>: What happened when North Carolina changed its laws to require top-scoring students to be placed in advanced math?</p>\n<p>The state board of education changed the test cutoffs, subverting the intent of the law by dropping almost all students from the top-scoring category.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.educationprogress.org/p/the-algebra-gatekeepers?utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;hide_intro_popup=true\">Janet Johnson and John Wittle</a>: The law was intended to help high school students who excelled in their math classes move into the advanced track. Before the scoring change, 11% of high school students statewide scored at Level 5, the highest level, with some districts seeing rates as high as 25%. The EVAAS Prediction vs. Performance table (above) showed that in 2009, 42,144 students were predicted to be successful in 8th-grade algebra, and only 18,670 students were enrolled. Using EVAAS prediction as the metric would have given 23,474 more students access to advanced math.</p>\n<p>After the law passed, which required schools to admit all Level 5 students to advanced classes, and the state changed the scoring scale, fewer than 1,500 (too few to report) high school students in the entire state achieved Level 5.</p>\n<p>The schools had technically complied with the law while completely subverting its intent. These charts are from the NC School Report Cards.14 After 2019, the Math 1 Performance charts show no Level 5 and very little Level 4, similar to this.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nW8w!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0446901a-56a2-472c-8015-0df81b64a743_1346x744.webp\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.educationprogress.org/p/the-algebra-gatekeepers\">The full post</a> on \u2018the Algebra gatekeepers\u2019 keeps outlining all the tactics used to ensure that kids do not learn algebra, especially disadvantaged kids. As you read it, it keeps getting worse.</p>\n<blockquote><p>For example, we attended a meeting with the parents of a middle school girl who had earned an A in 7th-grade pre-algebra but was denied enrollment in 8th-grade algebra despite her and her parents&#8217; wishes. The teachers argued that her formative assessments didn&#8217;t align with her summative performance, suggesting her previous success didn&#8217;t guarantee future outcomes.</p>\n<p>The language arts teacher claimed the student had &#8220;appeared to struggle&#8221; during benchmark activities and that earning an A seemed &#8220;harder for her than for other students who achieved similar summative data results.&#8221; The math teacher who had given her an A pointed to C grades on some earlier formative assessments, arguing that despite her subsequent A performance on chapter tests and other summative data points, these initial benchmark scores indicated she &#8220;sometimes struggles with foundational concepts during the formative assessment process.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The administrators nodded knowingly as teachers referenced &#8220;inconsistent performance across benchmark measures&#8221; and &#8220;concerns about the gap between formative and summative data trends.&#8221; They suggested that while her final grades represented solid summative data, the formative assessment patterns revealed &#8220;areas of concern&#8221; that made advanced placement inadvisable, regardless of what the summative data actually showed about her mastery of the subject matter. This is just an example of the kind of talk the parents encountered, so the church advocacy group started bringing someone from our staff to the meetings to help them cut through this.</p>\n<p><strong>This type of circular reasoning, where success was reframed as evidence of potential failure, was typical of how schools justified excluding qualified students from advanced courses.</strong></p>\n<p>Administrators would routinely promise that students could move to advanced tracks &#8220;later, in high school,&#8221; but our analyses and other research we found indicate students rarely moved to the advanced track after the 8th grade.</p>\n<p>The tracking system created rigid pathways where missing 8th-grade algebra typically meant students couldn&#8217;t reach calculus by graduation, limiting their college and career options.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>One fifth grader exemplified the problem. He had scored at the highest level on every test, had a 98% EVAAS prediction for success, and straight As on his report card. He was also officially classified as Academically Gifted by the school. When a new advanced math class was created, he wasn&#8217;t invited. When he asked to join, his parents were told no, he needed to be &#8220;recommended.&#8221; School officials told us, with straight faces, that his consistent past success was no indication he could succeed in advanced math, that they were keeping him out for his own good.</p></blockquote>\n<p>What North Carolina is doing here, excluding lots of qualified students, does at least seem better than ending algebra entirely for everyone, I suppose.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/gtmom/status/1951008656675447211\">Pamela Hobart also looked into the same writeup and offers her own thread,</a> notes that this steps fully into cartoon villainy.</p>\n<p>The true teaching of algebra to kids who are ready for it is almost impossible to find. <a href=\"https://t.co/UplE9wrtxm\">Even if you send your child to a \u2018gifted\u2019 school</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/Raemon777/status/1954035704729882747\">they mostly won\u2019t let kids get more than a year or two ahead of \u2018schedule.\u2019</a> Schools instead think it is better kids be bored for five years, for their own good you see.</p>\n<p>Raymond Arnold points to the best objection I have seen, which is that if a more advanced option exists then many parents will push for it even when it is inappropriate for their particular child, or use it to push their child way too hard, and while this means some kids are bored it is saving a lot of families from being forced into a red queen\u2019s race.</p>\n<p>This is a real cost, but the prior should be rather extremely stacked against \u2018if we let kids learn more then parents would try to have their kids learn too much and this would be bad,\u2019 especially when you can gate the advanced classes with objective tests. Yes, parents can push their kids to study harder to try and pass those tests, but that\u2019s a risk I am willing to take.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h4>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The War on Reading Ability Grouping In Particular</h4>\n\n\n<p>What is the steelman case that \u2018ability grouping doesn\u2019t work\u2019 or \u2018ability grouping has been tried and didn\u2019t work\u2019 in some particular context?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.karenvaites.org/p/leveled-reading-groups-dont-work?utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web\">This by Karen Vaites is perhaps the closes</a>t, in particular on early reading grouping, convinced me that in practice you really can mess it up badly enough to make things actively worse. This was convincing that we\u2019re messing up badly enough that this is a real possibility.</p>\n<p>As in, what happens in practice is that you group kids by a measurement of abstract \u2018reading level\u2019 and then focus on \u2018achievement\u2019 of \u2018reading level,\u2019 forbid them to read anything beyond \u2018reading level,\u2019 and don\u2019t ask what actual skills they need, don\u2019t move them between groupings as their skills change, and then wonder why it isn\u2019t working.</p>\n<p>One could almost say, <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/are-classroom-reading-groups-the-best-way-to-teach-reading-maybe-not/2018/08?cmp=soc-li-shr\">if you look at the details</a>, that the teachers are using \u2018reading groups\u2019 as a substitute for actually teaching the children to read. You put them in a group and then you did your job. Again, yeah, I can see how that wouldn\u2019t work. Indeed, if you are outsourcing the teaching job to other kids, then at that point you actively want uneven groups, because you want to group students with student teachers.</p>\n<p>Whereas once students get to \u2018escape velocity\u2019 on reading, which the better students have relatively early, they no longer need a teacher, they just need motivation and permission to read books. Whereas the system seems designed to stop kids from reading books they want to read if they are deemed \u2018too hard\u2019? A kid can tell you if a book is too hard, they won\u2019t want to read it.</p>\n<p>One big complaint is that it is \u2018hard to measure reading level.\u2019 I don\u2019t think it is hard. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/35566-you-can-observe-a-lot-just-by-watching\">You can observe a lot just by watching</a>. The problem is that you\u2019re measuring a set of distinct reading skills as if it was one number, and then treating that one number as real, and also abdicating all the real work.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sarah Sparks: <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/are-classroom-reading-groups-the-best-way-to-teach-reading-maybe-not/2018/08?cmp=soc-li-shr\">But evidence suggests</a> that the practice may be less beneficial than teachers think: It can exacerbate achievement gaps and even slow reading growth for some children unless the groups are fluid and focused on skills rather than overall achievement.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat we\u2019ve discovered is that it\u2019s fine to have a group of students of different levels, as long as they all are working on the same learning needs,\u201d said Carol Connor, an education professor at the University of California, Irvine, who developed the program. \u201cYou can have students of different reading abilities who all need to work on decoding. &#8230; What doesn\u2019t work is if you put your kids who already know how to code in a group to learn how to code, again. You receive more behavior problems because they\u2019re really bored, &#8230; and our research suggests that it has a negative effect on their growth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Karen Vaites: Tim Shanahan breaks down key research and its instructional implications in <a href=\"https://shanahanonliteracy.com/blog/the-instructional-level-concept-revisited-teaching-with-complex-text#sthash.kNFa1zLD.dpbs\"><em>The Instructional Level Concept Revisited: Teaching with Complex Text</em></a><em>. </em>As researchers looked into the effectiveness working at reading level, studies found that it &#8220;has made no difference\u2014that is the kids taught from grade level materials do as well as those at an instructional level\u2014or the instructional level placements have led to less learning.&#8221;</p>\n<p>More recently, <a href=\"https://shanahanonliteracy.com/blog/new-evidence-on-teaching-reading-at-frustration-levels\">he highlights additional new evidence</a> from a study of third graders: \u201cResults indicate that weaker readers, using texts at two, three, and four grade levels above their instructional levels with the assistance of lead readers [other, better reading, third graders], outscored both proficient and less proficient students in the control group across multiple measures of reading achievement.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.readingrockets.org/blogs/shanahan-on-literacy/what-text-levels-are-appropriate-independent-reading\">From a question</a>: My daughter is in first grade. Her classroom teachers have all the books in the classroom library leveled, and students are not allowed to go beyond their reading level during \u201cIndependent\u201d reading.</p>\n<p>From the answer: Your daughter\u2019s aspirations as a reader are the problem here. Some kids are allowed to read the red-dot books and others are stuck with the baby books with the blue dots. She wants to be a red dot kid, to hang with the red dot kids, to be seen as a red dot kid \u2026 but her teacher can only see her as a blue dot kid and she must learn to stay to her own bookshelf with her own kind if she is going to succeed in this classroom.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>In the meantime, explain to your daughter that the teacher is trying to help her but that we teachers sometimes don\u2019t get it right, and that you can\u2019t always \u201cfight city hall.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>So yes, you group primarily by what aspects the kids need to work on most, and that works better. Sure. I can totally believe that is a better strategy. Skill issue.</p>\n<p>Instead of using it to figure out what kids need to do to learn to read and putting them in position to learn that, it sounds like grouping is being used to prevent kids from meaningfully reading? The purpose is to gate reading behind general tests? To spread \u2018equality\u2019 to progress on different reading aspects?</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sarah Sparks<strong>: It sounds like good sense.</strong> &#8220;Kids should be reading just-right texts as they grow as readers.&#8221; That just <em>sounds</em> <em>sensible</em>, doesn&#8217;t it? Many urban legends do&#8230; until you know better.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I can see why that might actively backfire. This isn\u2019t about \u2018ability grouping\u2019 not working. It\u2019s about failing to actually group by the relevant ability, and it\u2019s about the \u2018just-right text\u2019 theory that seems to me obviously wrong.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sarah Sparks: During Tier 1 instruction, you want all kids working with grade level texts; students reading below grade level will need scaffolding and support (as well as targeted Tier 2 and/or 3 intervention).</p>\n<p>This promotes equity, for it&#8217;s the best mechanism for helping below-benchmark students to catch up.</p>\n<p>It also honors the fact that a fifth grader who reads at second grade level is still <em>thinking</em> at the level of a fifth grader, and he or she will remain engaged and motivated by learning content and vocabulary at his or her developmental level. (No more baby books for big kids, y&#8217;all!)</p>\n<p>For details on how to do this, check out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://shanahanonliteracy.com/blog/eight-ways-to-help-kids-to-read-complex-text\"><em>Eight Ways to Help Kids Read Complex Text</em></a> by Tim Shanahan</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://achievethecore.org/aligned/supporting-all-learners-with-complex-texts/\">Supporting All Learners with Complex Text</a>, a resource collection from Achieve the Core.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://achievethecore.org/page/3190/reading-instruction-with-the-end-in-mind-rethinking-reading-levels-2018-december-webinar\">Rethinking Reading Levels</a> webinar.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ignore the \u2018this promotes equity\u2019 framing, since you could simply say \u2018this promotes learning to read.\u2019 Equity via catching up those lagging is good, and you call it learning.</p>\n<p>The theory here is that age matters a lot. That if you are a fifth grader, your ability to learn is inherently much stronger than that of a second grader, whereas the ability of different second graders is alike? Equality (of those at the same age) for me, inequality (of those at different ages) for thee. Whereas the correct model is that each kid has a different ability to learn different things, that usually improves steadily with age.</p>\n<p>But also note that this is saying that the best way for many students at second grade reading level to learn reading is to assign them to read fifth grade level books, indeed to mandate it. Yes, I can believe that. So why are we so often telling kids at second grade reading level or literally in second grade or both that they can\u2019t read the fifth grade books even when they want to?</p>\n<p>The other theory present in this proposal is, how about using techniques that actually teach kids reading. And yeah, I agree, that would be great.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/tracewoodgrains/status/1944760629098647564\">Tracing Woods</a> (replying to Vaites): This is an extremely useful article that deserves a full, thorough response.</p>\n<p>My short response is that I agree narrowly (most leveled readers seem quite bad, training specific skills matters, in-class grouping for reading is quite popular and often pretty uninspired) and disagree broadly (there is pretty strong evidence for the value of several forms of ability grouping, drawing from eg Direct Instruction, Success for All, acceleration/gifted literature; ability grouping has acquired a bad reputation for reasons mostly unrelated to its performance; \u201cgrade level\u201d is the wrong measure) in a way that would be productive to hash out more fully.</p>\n<p>I agree fully that the real question is cultural.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The War Will Continue</h4>\n\n\n<p>In case you didn\u2019t realize that there is a war.
