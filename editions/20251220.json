                "<p>Back in the ancient AI days of 2023, my co-authors and I invented a term to describe the weird ability of AI to do some work incredibly well and other work incredibly badly in ways that didn&#8217;t map very well to our human intuition of the difficulty of the task. We called this the <a href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/centaurs-and-cyborgs-on-the-jagged\">&#8220;Jagged Frontier&#8221;</a> of AI ability, and it remains a key feature of AI and an endless source of confusion. How can an AI be <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10849\">superhuman at differential medical diagnosis</a> or <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/19/openai-gold-medal-math-olympiad/\">good at very hard math </a>(yes, they are really good at math now, famously outside the frontier until recently) and yet still be bad at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/26/business/ai-smarter-human-intelligence-puzzle.html\">relatively simple visual puzzles</a> or <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/project-vend-2\">running a vending machine</a>? The exact abilities of AI are often a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07930-y\">mystery</a>, so it is no wonder AI is harder to use than it seems.</p><p>I think jaggedness is going to remain a big part of AIs going forward, but there is less certainty over what it means. <a href=\"https://x.com/tomaspueyo\">Tomas Pueyo</a> posted this viral image on <a href=\"https://x.com/tomaspueyo/status/1993360931267473662?s=20\">X</a> that outlined his <a href=\"https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/when-will-we-make-god\">vision</a>. In his view, the growing frontier will outpace jaggedness. Sure, the AI is bad at some things and may still be relatively bad even as it improves, but the collective human ability frontier is mostly fixed, and AI ability is growing rapidly. What does it matter if AI is relatively bad at running a vending machine, if the AI still becomes better than any human?</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SY-V!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92c4e814-870d-401b-80ac-3ebfa0cfc3af_3444x1924.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"Image\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"813\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SY-V!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92c4e814-870d-401b-80ac-3ebfa0cfc3af_3444x1924.jpeg\" title=\"Image\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>While the future is always uncertain, I think this conception misses out on a few critical aspects about the nature of work and technology. First, the frontier is very jagged indeed, and it might be that, because of this jaggedness, we get supersmart AIs which never quite fully overlap with human tasks. For example, a major source of jaggedness is that LLMs do not remember new tasks and learn from them in a permanent way. A lot of AI companies are pursuing solutions to this issue, but it may be that this problem is harder to solve than researchers expect. Without memory, AIs will struggle to do many tasks humans can do, even while being superhuman in other areas. <a href=\"https://colin-fraser.net/\">Colin Fraser</a> drew <a href=\"https://x.com/colin_fraser/status/1994188009608983008?s=20\">two examples</a> of what this sort of AI-human overlap might look like. You can see how AI is indeed superhuman in some areas, but in others it is either far below human level or not overlapping at all. If this is true, then AI will create new opportunities working in complement with human beings, since we both bring different abilities to the table. </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!g4ku!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd64b0492-5e74-410f-8154-68a458de7249_3106x536.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"251\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!g4ku!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd64b0492-5e74-410f-8154-68a458de7249_3106x536.png\" width=\"1456\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>These are conceptual drawings, but a group of scientists recently<a href=\"https://www.agidefinition.ai/\"> tried to map the shape of AI ability </a>and found that it was growing unevenly, just as the jagged frontier would predict.

A system is only as functional as its worst components. We call these problems bottlenecks. Some bottlenecks are because the AI is stubbornly subhuman at some tasks. LLM vision systems <a href=\"https://www.rsna.org/news/2025/july/using-llms-in-radiology\">aren&#8217;t good enough at reading medical imaging</a> so they can&#8217;t yet replace doctors; LLMs <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-02008-z\">are too helpful</a> when they should push back so they can&#8217;t yet replace therapists; <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/why-language-models-hallucinate/\">hallucinations persist</a> even if they have become rarer which means they can&#8217;t yet do tasks where 100% accuracy is required; and so on. If the frontier continues to expand, some of these problems may disappear, but weaknesses are not the only form of bottleneck.</p><p>Some bottlenecks are because of processes that have nothing to do with ability. Even if AI can now identify promising drug candidates dramatically faster than traditional methods, clinical trials still need actual human patients who take actual time to recruit, dose, and monitor. The FDA still requires human review of applications. Even if AI increases the rate of good drug ideas by ten times or more, the constraint becomes the rate of approval, not the rate of discovery. The bottleneck migrates from intelligence to institutions, and institutions move at institution speed.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_j3E!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe676bed1-1158-4ecd-808d-16f91e9c92f1_2816x1504.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"778\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_j3E!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe676bed1-1158-4ecd-808d-16f91e9c92f1_2816x1504.jpeg\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Image from Google&#8217;s Nano Banana Pro. More on that in a minute!</figcaption></figure></div><p>And even where the AI is almost completely superhuman, humans may be needed for edge cases. As an example, take a study that used AI to reproduce Cochrane reviews, the famous deeply researched meta-studies that synthesize many medical studies to figure out the scientific consensus on a topic.<a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.13.25329541v1.full\"> A team of researchers found that GPT-4.1, when properly prompted and supported, &#8220;reproduced and updated an entire issue of Cochrane reviews (n=12) in two days, representing approximately 12 work-years of traditional systematic review work.&#8221;</a>  The AI screened over 146,000 citations, read full papers, extracted data, and ran statistical analyses. It actually outperformed human reviewers on accuracy. Oddly, much of the hard intellectual work &#8212; finding relevant studies, pulling the right numbers, synthesizing results &#8212; is solidly inside the frontier. But the AI can't access supplementary files and it can't email authors to request unpublished data, things human reviewers do routinely. This makes up less than 1% of errors in the review, but those errors mean you can't fully automate the process. Twelve work-years become two days, but only if a human with expertise in how science is actually done handles the edge cases.</p><p>This is the pattern: jaggedness creates bottlenecks, and bottlenecks mean that even very smart AI cannot easily substitute for humans. At least not yet. This is likely good in some ways (preventing rapid job loss) but frustrating in others (making it hard to speed up scientific research as much as we might hope). Bottlenecks also concentrate the work of AI companies into making the AI better at things that are holding it back, the way math ability rapidly improved once it became an obvious barrier. The historian Thomas Hughes had a term for this. Studying how electrical systems developed, he noticed that progress often stalled on a single technical or social problem. He called these &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Networks-Power-Electrification-1880-1930-Softshell/dp/0801846145\">reverse salients</a>&#8221; - the one technical or social problem holding back the system from leaping ahead.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p2fo!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecb3956b-57c1-4cf0-810e-dd60869aaa67_394x303.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"Image\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"215.32994923857868\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p2fo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecb3956b-57c1-4cf0-810e-dd60869aaa67_394x303.jpeg\" title=\"Image\" width=\"280\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><h1>Reverse Salients</h1><p>Bottlenecks can create the impression that AI will never be able to do something, when, in reality, progress is held back by a single jagged weakness.

For example, take PowerPoint decks. Every major AI company has been trying to get their AI to make PowerPoint, and they have done this by having the AIs write computer code (which they are very good at) to create a PowerPoint from scratch. This is a hard process, but both Claude and ChatGPT have improved a lot, even if their slides are a little dull. For example, I took my book, Co-Intelligence, and threw it into Claude and asked for a slide deck summary. The model is very smart, but the PowerPoint deck is limited by the fact that it has to be written in code.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GNbJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa867d9cd-8283-4a3e-a0da-2c8c2ebba069_1345x752.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"340.49665427509296\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GNbJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa867d9cd-8283-4a3e-a0da-2c8c2ebba069_1345x752.png\" width=\"609\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Now here is the same thing in Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https://notebooklm.google/\">NotebookLM</a> application, using its smart Gemini AI model combined with Nano Banana Pro.

Hallucinations are very rare, and the sources are correct. It can create otter analogies or come up with a punk-themed description. This is the intellectually demanding part, and AIs have been capable of it for over a year. But making slides or other visual presentations was a bottleneck to making walls of text useful. The problem isn&#8217;t completely solved: images are not perfect, and you can&#8217;t edit them (apparently this will be fixed soon), but you can see where things are going.</p><h1>Many lurches</h1><p>Even if AI becomes superhuman at analysis and PowerPoint, I don&#8217;t think that means AI necessarily replaces the jobs of consultants and designers. Those jobs consist of many different tasks along the jagged frontier that AI is bad at and which humans excel: can you collect information and get buy-in from the many parties involved? Can you understand the unwritten rules that determine what people actually need? Can you come up with something unique to address a deep issue, that stands out from AI material? The jagged frontier offers many opportunities for human work.</p><p>Yet, we should expect to see lurches forward, where focusing on reverse salients leads to sudden removals of bottlenecks. Areas of work that used to be only human become something that AI can do. If you want to understand where AI is headed, don&#8217;t watch the benchmarks. Watch the bottlenecks. When one breaks, everything behind it comes flooding through. Image generation was holding back presentations, documents, visual communication of all kinds. Now it isn&#8217;t. What&#8217;s the next bottleneck? Memory? Real-time learning? The ability to take actions in the physical world?</p><p>Somewhere, right now, an AI lab is treating each of these bottlenecks as a reverse salient. We won&#8217;t get much warning when they break through. But a jagged frontier cuts both ways. So far, every lurch forward leaves yet more edges in which humans are needed. There will be many lurches ahead. There will also be many opportunities.

                "<p>My all-time favorite word game is called 'Wordiest'. It was an earlyish Android game with a pretty simple mechanic: You get 14 Scrabble-style tiles and need to make the two highest-scoring words you can.  Wordiest had a really nice visualization showing how you scored relative to 100 other previous players. It was implemented with a cached word and score database that worked entirely offline. It was <em>ideal</em> for long plane flights.</p>\n<p>A number of years ago, I switched my primary phone to iOS. Wordiest was one of the few things I missed from Android.  Somewhere along the way, the developer, &quot;Concreterose&quot; shut down. Google pulled Wordiest from the play store. And that was that.</p>\n<p>Sometime early this year, I decided to build a new version of Wordiest as a mobile-first web app. I called it <a href=\"https://anagrammatic.org\">Anagrammatic</a>. I spent a couple weeks on it. It was ok. Getting the drag and drop right was a pain in the neck. But it basically worked.  It wasn't as fun as Wordiest and didn't have the cool after-game visualization of how you did relative to all those other players.</p>\n<p>Late last week, OpenAI shipped ChatGPT 5.2. They claimed that it was really good at code. Looking around for tasks to throw at it, I decided it was time to try a &quot;too-hard&quot; task.</p>\n<p>Friday night, I downloaded a copy of the packaged Android APK for the last release of Wordiest and handed it to Codex + ChatGPT 5.2:</p>\n<p><a class=\"glightbox\" href=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251218-152252.png\"><img alt=\"pasted image 20251218 152252\" src=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251218-152252.png\" /></a></p>\n<p>Once I gave it the reverse engineering tools, it got to work. After about half an hour, I had a playable version of the core game.</p>\n<p>The funniest moment of the whole experience was just after I told it that I wanted 100% parity with the Android implementation. It stopped me and asked if we really wanted to add ads and an in-app purchase to remove those ads. I gave it permission to skip that.</p>\n<p><a class=\"glightbox\" href=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251218-153124.png\"><img alt=\"pasted image 20251218 153124\" src=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251218-153124.png\" /></a></p>\n<p>A few more hours of Codex grinding and occasionally checking in with me and...we were basically done.</p>\n<p>Android:</p>\n<p><a class=\"glightbox\" href=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251218-152704.png\"><img alt=\"pasted image 20251218 152704\" src=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251218-152704.png\" /></a></p>\n<p>iOS:</p>\n<p><a class=\"glightbox\" href=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251218-152636.png\"><img alt=\"pasted image 20251218 152636\" src=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251218-152636.png\" /></a></p>\n<p>Android:</p>\n<p><a class=\"glightbox\" href=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251218-152726.png\"><img alt=\"pasted image 20251218 152726\" src=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251218-152726.png\" /></a></p>\n<p>iOS:</p>\n<p><a class=\"glightbox\" href=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251218-152821.png\"><img alt=\"pasted image 20251218 152821\" src=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251218-152821.png\" /></a></p>\n<p>This whole time, I have written zero lines of code. I have read zero lines of code.</p>\n<p>I've made some high-level architectural decisions and I've done some play-testing.</p>\n<p>You can read <a href=\"https://github.com/obra/wordiest/tree/main/docs/plans\">the implementation plans Codex put together</a>.</p>\n<p>About 80% of my &quot;person-time&quot; on this project has been working through glitches in the tile shapes that GPT 5.2 built. The first version of the tiles was almost right...but not perfect. I spent a couple of hours (while I was doing other work) checking in on its many, many failing attempts to fix the tile borders before it finally nailed them. I should have kept screenshots. There were a bunch of hilarious mistakes.</p>\n<p>This is one of the weirdest things about using agentic development tools. My intuition for what's easy and what's hard is completely shot.</p>\n<p>Reverse engineer an Android game, figure out all the gameplay, every layout weird, every UI behavior, the compressed wordlist, and the score formats.</p>\n<p>&quot;No problem.&quot;</p>\n<p>Port all of that to Swift and SpriteKit?</p>\n<p>&quot;Piece of cake.&quot;</p>\n<p>Now, center the letter a little bit better and make the rounded border on the tile have space for tile bonuses?</p>\n<p>&quot;I'm trying boss, but this is really, really hard. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'll keep at it. But yikes.&quot;</p>\n<p>But, at the end of the day, I had a playable recreation of the Wordiest I knew and loved. The only question was...what could I do with it?</p>\n<p>I reached out to Wordiest's author, Darrell Anderson. He, very graciously, gave me his blessing to release this new version of Wordiest and even told me a bit about how he'd built the cool offline scoring system back in the day.</p>\n<p>Over the past couple days, I've had a few friends playing the TestFlight version of the game. My dad told me that it works much better than the web based version I built last spring. Then I had to explain to him that I didn't actually do any of the engineering.</p>\n<p>Wednesday afternoon, I threw caution to the wind and sent &quot;Wordiest Classic&quot; to the Apple App Store's notoriously fickle review process. I didn't expect much, but figured that they'd give me a list of tasks to work through if I wanted to distribute Wordiest publicly.</p>\n<p>I was not expecting the response Apple sent a day later.\n<a class=\"glightbox\" href=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251218-152126.png\"><img alt=\"pasted image 20251218 152126\" src=\"https://blog.fsck.com/assets/2025/12/pasted-image-20251218-152126.png\" /></a></p>\n<p>You can check out the source at <a href=\"https://github.com/obra/wordiest\">https://github.com/obra/wordiest</a> or you can just <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/wordiest-classic/id6756533498\">download and play the game on your iPhone</a>.</p>"

            "summary": "<p>My all-time favorite word game is called 'Wordiest'. It was an earlyish Android game with a pretty simple mechanic: You get 14 Scrabble-style tiles and need to make the two highest-scoring words you can. Wordiest had a really nice visualization showing how you scored relative to 100 other previous players. It was implemented with a cached word and score database that worked entirely offline. It was <em>ideal</em> for long plane flights.</p> <p>A number of years ago, I switched my primary phone to iOS. Wordiest was one of the few things I missed from Android. Somewhere along the way, the developer, &quot;Concreterose&quot; shut down. Google pulled Wordiest from the play store. And that was that.</p> <p>Sometime early this year, I decided to build a new version of Wordiest as a mobile-first web app. I called it <a href=\"https://anagrammatic.org\">Anagrammatic</a>. I spent a couple weeks on it. It was ok. Getting the drag and drop right was a pain in the neck. But it basically worked. It wasn't as fun as Wordiest and didn't have the cool after-game visualization of how you did relative to all those other players.</p> <p>Late last week, OpenAI shipped ChatGPT 5.2. They claimed that it was really good",
