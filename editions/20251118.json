A few days before that launch, I wrote my <a href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/ai-has-a-strategy\">first post on this Substack about OpenAI&#8217;s earlier GPT-3 model.</a> Then ChatGPT came out, and I <a href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-mechanical-professor\">wrote </a>immediately afterwards that &#8220;I am usually pretty hesitant to make technology predictions, but I think that this is going to change our world much sooner than we expect, and much more drastically. Rather than automating jobs that are repetitive &amp; dangerous, there is now the prospect that the first jobs that are disrupted by AI will be more analytic; creative; and involve more writing and communication.&#8221;</p><p>I think I got that one right.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!L1NO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ac6903e-8339-49df-b41f-ff9848694f9f_1239x1166.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"515.7126715092817\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!L1NO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ac6903e-8339-49df-b41f-ff9848694f9f_1239x1166.png\" width=\"548\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">My first post after using GPT-3.5 three years ago</figcaption></figure></div><p>I could explain the difference between the original ChatGPT and the new AI model from Google, Gemini 3, that launched today.

If you&#8217;re reading this blog, you probably knew AI could do that. What&#8217;s more interesting is what else Gemini 3 can do when you stop thinking of it as a chatbot and start thinking of it as something else entirely</p><h1>Coding tools that aren&#8217;t just coding tools</h1><p>Along with Gemini 3, Google has launched Antigravity. For programmers, Antigravity should be familiar territory, it is similar to Claude Code and OpenAI Codex, specialized tools that can be given access to your computer and which can autonomously write computer programs with guidance. If you aren&#8217;t a programmer, you may dismiss Antigravity and similar tools. I think that is a mistake because the ability to code isn&#8217;t just about programming, it&#8217;s about being able to do anything that happens on a computer. And that changes what these tools actually are.</p><p>Gemini 3 is very good at coding, and this matters to you even if you don&#8217;t think of what you do as programming. A fundamental perspective powering AI development is that everything you do on a computer is, ultimately, code, and if AI can work with code it can do anything someone with a computer can: build you dashboards, work with websites, create PowerPoint, read your files, and so on. This makes agents that can code general purpose tools. Antigravity embraces this idea, with the concept of an Inbox, a place where I can send AI agents off on assignments and where they can ping me when they need permission or help. </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!g_pi!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d46f934-2f6b-4db4-8ec6-90db72a96fb4_1342x1093.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"355.1028315946349\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!g_pi!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d46f934-2f6b-4db4-8ec6-90db72a96fb4_1342x1093.png\" width=\"436\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">You can see I am working with four different agents right now, one is working and another needs my help to proceed.</figcaption></figure></div><p>I don&#8217;t communicate with these agents in code, I communicate with them in English and they use code to do the work. Because Gemini 3 is good at planning, it is capable of figuring out what to do, and also when to ask my approval. For example, I gave Antigravity access to a directory on my computer containing all of my posts for this newsletter.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/feed#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> I then asked Gemini 3,0: &#8220;I would like an attractive list of predictions I have made about AI in a single site, also do a web search to see which I was right and wrong about.&#8221; It then read through all the files, executing code, until it gave me a plan which I could edit or approve. The screenshot below is the first time the AI asked me anything about the project, and its understanding of what I wanted was impressive. I made a couple of small changes and let the AI work.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iw2C!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F748a5067-4fed-449a-bac8-46dfaf5a00b2_2223x1538.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"432.9546703296703\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iw2C!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F748a5067-4fed-449a-bac8-46dfaf5a00b2_2223x1538.png\" width=\"626\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>It then did web research, created a site, took over my browser to confirm the site worked, and presented me the results.

There were no hallucinations I spotted, but there were things I corrected, though those errors were more about individual judgement calls or human-like misunderstandings of my intentions than traditional AI problems. Importantly, I felt that I was in control of the choices AI was making because the AI checked in and its work was visible. It felt much more like managing a teammate than prompting an AI through a chat interface.</p><h1>PhD Level Intelligence?</h1><p>But Antigravity isn&#8217;t the only way Gemini 3 surprised me. The other was in how it handled work that required genuine judgment. As I have mentioned many times on this site, benchmarking AI progress is a mess. Gemini 3 takes a definitive benchmark lead on most stats, (although it may still not be able to beat the $200 GPT-5 Pro Model, but I suspect that might change when Gemini 3&#8217;s inevitable Deep Think version comes out). But you will hear one phrase repeated a lot in the AI world - that a model has &#8220;PhD level intelligence.&#8221;</p><p>I decided to put that to the test. I gave Gemini 3 access to a directory of old files I had used for research into crowdfunding a decade ago. It was a mishmash of files labelled things like &#8220;project_final_seriously_this_time_done.xls&#8221; and data in out-of-date statistical formats. I told the AI to &#8220;figure out the data and the structure and the initial cleaning from the STATA files and get it ready to do a new analysis to find new things.&#8221; And it did, recovering corrupted data and figuring out the complexities of the environment.</p><p>Then I gave it a typical assignment that you would expect from a second year PhD student, doing minor original research. With no further hints I wrote: &#8220;great, now i want you to write an original paper using this data. do deep research on the field, make the paper not just about crowdfunding but about an important theoretical topic of interest in either entrepreneurship or business strategy. conduct a sophisticated analysis, write it up as if for a journal.&#8221; I gave it no suggestions beyond that and yet the AI considered the data, generated original hypotheses, tested them statistically, and gave me formatted output in the form of a document. The most fascinating part was that I did not give it any hints about what to research, it walked the tricky tightrope of figuring out what might be an interesting topic and how to execute it with the data it had - one of the hardest things to teach. After a couple of vague commands (&#8220;build it out more, make it better&#8221;) I got a 14 page paper.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vJvs!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e997e6a-f569-43e0-addc-f97f4c760208_2325x1404.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"351.3585164835165\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vJvs!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3e997e6a-f569-43e0-addc-f97f4c760208_2325x1404.png\" width=\"582\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">The first two pages of the paper</figcaption></figure></div><p>Aside from this, I was impressed that the AI came up with its own measure, a way of measuring how unique a crowdfunding idea was by using natural language processing tools to compare its description mathematically to other descriptions.

In some ways, yes, if you define a PhD level intelligence as doing the work of a competent grad student at a research university. But it also had some of the weaknesses of a grad student. The idea was good, as were many elements of the execution, but there were also problems: some of its statistical methods needed more work, some of its approaches were not optimal, some of its theorizing went too far given the evidence, and so on. Again, we have moved past hallucinations and errors to more subtle, and often human-like, concerns. Interestingly, when I gave it suggestions with a lot of leeway, the way I would a student: (&#8220;make sure that you cover the crowdfunding research more to establish methodology, etc.&#8221;) it improved tremendously, so maybe more guidance would be all that Gemini needed. We are not there yet, but &#8220;PhD intelligence&#8221; no longer seems that far away.</p><h1>Gemini 3</h1><p>Gemini 3 is a very good thinking and doing partner that is available to billions of people around the world. It is also a sign of many things: the fact that we have not yet seen a significant slowdown in AI&#8217;s continued development, the rise of agentic models, the need to figure out better ways to manage smart AIs, and more. It shows how far AI has come.</p><p>Three years ago, we were impressed that a machine could write a poem about otters. Less than 1,000 days later, I am debating statistical methodology with an agent that built its own research environment. The era of the chatbot is turning into the era of the digital coworker. To be very clear, Gemini 3 isn&#8217;t perfect, and it still needs a manager who can guide and check it. But it suggests that &#8220;human in the loop&#8221; is evolving from &#8220;human who fixes AI mistakes&#8221; to &#8220;human who directs AI work.&#8221; And that may be the biggest change since the release of ChatGPT.</p><p></p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/subscribe\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class=\"button-wrapper\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/three-years-from-gpt-3-to-gemini?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share\"><span>Share</span></a></p><p></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!f-5x!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20744fc-7146-409d-8eff-519e9a2d13d7_2181x1296.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"179.45529573590096\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!f-5x!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20744fc-7146-409d-8eff-519e9a2d13d7_2181x1296.png\" width=\"302\" /><div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">I asked Gemini &#8220;using code alone create a really good cover image for my post about Gemini 3.0 in Substack, look up what size those images are&#8221; and the AI was able to use a combination of tools, from web browsing to coding, to create an image using math alone.</figcaption></figure></div><p></p><div class=\"footnote\"><a class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/feed#footnote-anchor-1\" id=\"footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Obligatory warning: Giving an AI agent access to your computer can be risky if you don&#8217;t know what you are doing.

This is more one size with an adjustable personality, whereas the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OQ0RvMLVUM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">actual size</a> adjusters are when you move between instant, thinking and pro.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Fidji Simo: Today we\u2019re upgrading the GPT-5 series with the release of <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GPT-5.1 Instant and Thinking</a>. These chat models are trained using the same stack as our reasoning models, so they score higher on factuality and complex problem-solving than GPT-5, while also introducing a more natural, conversational tone. We think many people will find that GPT-5.1 does a better job of bringing IQ and EQ together, but one default clearly can\u2019t meet everyone\u2019s needs.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why we\u2019re also making it easier to customize ChatGPT with a range of presets to choose from: professional, friendly, candid, quirky, efficient, cynical and nerdy.</p>\n<p>\u2026 On the other hand, power users want much more granular control.

Here are a few ways to decompress depending on what kind of stress you\u2019re feeling:</p>\n<p>[lists some things you can do, sorted by what type of distress is present.]</p></blockquote>\n<p>Different strokes for different folks. I find GPT-5\u2019s response to be pretty good, whereas I see GPT-5.1\u2019s response as kind of a condescending asshole?

Gemini Pro 2.5 reacted very similarly to GPT-5.1 including both starting with box breathing.</p>\n<p>The next example was when the user says \u2018always respond with six words\u2019 and GPT-5 can\u2019t help itself in one of its answers and adds slop after the six words, whereas GPT-5.1 follows the instruction for multiple outputs.

I think the GPT-5 answer is better than the GPT-5.1 Thinking answer. Both have the same content, but I found 5\u2019s answer easier to understand, and it\u2019s more concise while containing all the key info, and the vibe is better.

The experience should improve as precision improves over time, starting with the model knowing that you\u2019re an adult versus a minor.</li>\n<li>Adult mode basically got walked back for now, there is no concrete plan.</li>\n<li>GPT-4o can\u2019t be kept around in its old form, it is too psychologically risky. I think that OpenAI is right about this from both an ethical and a business perspective. You can argue that the benefits are diffuse and the harms are concentrated, but I don\u2019t think that works in practice. Some form of safeguards are needed.</li>\n<li>5.1 still has a knowledge cutoff at September 2024 and they didn\u2019t have much of a pitch on why it\u2019s smarter other than 76% on SWE-Bench.</li>\n<li>They mention that the personality sliders are \u2018coming soon.\u2019</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Mostly the answers don\u2019t tell us anything we didn\u2019t already know.

The good news is that while a vocal minority is actively mad about the safety stuff, that\u2019s largely because OpenAI seems to be continuing to botch implementation, and also most users are fine with it. Never confuse the loudest with the majority.</p>\n<h4>Overall Take</h4>\n<p>There are those who say GPT-5.1 is a big upgrade over 5.0. I\u2019m not seeing it. It does look like an incremental upgrade in a bunch of ways, especially in custom instructions handling, but no more than that.</p>\n<p>The bigger changes are on personality, an attempt to reconcile the 4o nature with 5.0. Here, I see the result as a downgrade for users like me, although the better custom instructions handling mitigates this. I am still in my \u2018try the new thing to get more data\u2019 cycle but I expect to keep Sonnet 4.5 as my main driver pending Gemini 3 and in theory Grok 4.1.</p>\n<h4></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

With the writing itself? Remarkably little. Almost none.</p>\n<p>I am aware that this is not optimal. But at current capability levels, with the prompts and tools I know about, in the context of my writing, AI has consistently proven to have terrible taste and to make awful suggestions, and also to be rather confident about them. This has proven sufficiently annoying that I haven\u2019t found it worth checking with the AIs.</p>\n<p>I also worry about AI influence pushing me towards generic slop, pushing me to sounding more like the AIs, and rounding off the edges of things, since every AI I\u2019ve tried this with keeps trying to do all that.</p>\n<p>I am sure it does not help that my writing style is very unusual, and basically not in the training data aside from things written by actual me, as far as I can tell.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I will quote LLM responses in my writing, always clearly labeled, when it seems useful to point to this kind of \u2018social proof\u2019 or sanity check.</p>\n<p>The other exception is that if you ask the AI to look for outright errors, especially things like spelling and grammar, it won\u2019t catch everything, but when it does catch something it is usually right. When you ask it to spot errors of fact, it\u2019s not as reliable, but it\u2019s good enough to check the list. I should be making a point of always doing that.</p>\n<p>I did the \u2018check for errors and other considerations\u2019 thing on this piece in particular with both Sonnet and 5.1-Thinking. This did improve the post but it\u2019s not obvious it improved it enough to be worth the time.</p>\n<p>I will also sometimes ask it about a particular line or argument I\u2019m considering, to see if it buys it, but only when what I care about is a typical reaction.</p>\n<p>If I was devoting more time to refining and editing, and cared more about marginal improvements there, that would open up more use cases, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right use of time for me on current margins versus training on more data or doing more chain of thought.</p>\n<p>Indirectly? I use it a lot more there, and again I could be doing more.</p>\n<p>There are some specific things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I have a vibe coded Chrome extension that saves me a bunch of trouble, that could be improved a lot with more work. It does things like generate the Table of Contents, crosspost to WordPress, auto-populate many links and quickly edit quotes to fix people\u2019s indifference to things like capitalization.</li>\n<li>I have a GPT called Zvi Archivist that I use to search through my past writing, to check if and when I\u2019ve already covered something and what I\u2019ve said about it.</li>\n<li>I have a transcriber for converting images to text because all the websites I know about that offer to do this for you are basically broken due to gating. This works.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Then there\u2019s things that are the same as what everyone does all the time. I do a lot of fact checking, sanity checking, Fermi estimation, tracking down information or sources, asking for explanations, questioning papers for the things I care about. Using the AI assistant in its classic sense. All of that is a big help and I notice my activation requirement to do this is higher than it should be.</p>\n<h4>Influencing Influence</h4>\n<p>I want this to be true so I\u2019m worried I can\u2019t be objective, but it seems true to me?</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/repligate/status/1987634008780361856\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Janus</a>: i think that it\u2019s almost always a bad idea to attempt to grow as an influencer on purpose.</p>\n<p>you can believe that it would be good if you were to grow, and still you shouldn\u2019t optimize for it.</p>\n<p>the only way it goes well is if it happens while you optimize for other things.</p>\n<p>More precisely than \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t on purpose\u201d what I\u2019m saying is you shouldn\u2019t be spending significant units of optimization on this goal and performing actions you wouldn\u2019t otherwise for this purpose</p></blockquote>\n<p>I am confident that if you optimize primarily for influence, that\u2019s full audience capture, slopification and so on, and you\u2019ve de facto sold your soul. You can in theory turn around and then use that influence to accomplish something worthwhile, but statistically speaking you won\u2019t do that.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Janus: Name a single account that explicitly optimizes for being a bigger influencer / \u201ctries to grow\u201d (instead of just happening as a side effect) and that does more good than harm to the ecosystem and generally has good vibes and interesting content</p>\n<p>You probably can\u2019t!</p>\n<p>actually, <a href=\"https://x.com/AISafetyMemes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://x.com/AISafetyMemes</a> is a contender</p>\n<p>but i know they\u2019re VERY controversial and I do think they\u2019re playing with fire</p>\n<p>i do consider them net positive but this is mostly bc they sometimes have very good taste and maybe cancel out the collateral damage</p>\n<p>but WOULD NOT RECOMMEND almost anyone trying this, lol</p></blockquote>\n<p>AISafetyMemes is definitely an example of flying dangerously close to the sun on this, but keeping enough focus and having enough taste to maybe be getting away with it. It\u2019s unclear that the net sign of impact there is positive, there are some very good posts but also some reasons to worry.</p>\n<h4>Size Matters</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/visakanv/status/1893981593322045500\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">No one reads the blog posts, they\u2019re too long, so might as well make them longer?</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>Visakan Veerasamy: An idea I\u2019ve been toying with and discussed with a couple of friends is the idea that blog posts could and probably should get much longer now that fewer people are reading them.</p>\n<p>One of the difficult things about writing a good essay is figuring out what to leave out so it is more manageable for readers.</p>\n<p>But on a blog where there is no expectation that anybody reads it, you do not have to leave anything out.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My guess is this is going to end up being a barbell situation like so many other things. If you cut it down, you want to cut it down as much as possible. If you\u2019re going long, then on the margin you\u2019re better off throwing everything in.</p>\n<h4>Time To Write A Shorter One</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/binarybits/status/1940067492694827230\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">I highlight this exactly because it seems backwards to me</a>. I notice that my experience is very much the opposite &#8211; when I want to write a good short piece it is MUCH more work per token, and often more total work.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Timothy Lee: I think a big reason that writing a book is such a miserable experience is that the time to write a good piece is more-than-linear in the number of words. A good 2,000-word piece is a lot more than 4x the work of a good 500-word piece.</p>\n<p>I assume this continues for longer pieces and a good 100,000 book is a lot more than 50x the work of a good 2,000-word article. Most authors deal with this by cutting corners and turning in books that aren\u2019t very good. And then there\u2019s Robert Caro.</p>\n<p>Josh You: I think by \u201cgood 2000 word piece\u201d Tim means \u201ca 2000 word piece that has been edited down from a much longer first draft\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Even then. Yes, a tight longer piece requires more structure and planning, but the times I write those 500-800 word pieces it takes forever, because you really do struggle over every word as you try to pack everything into the tiniest possible space.</p>\n<p>Writing a 100,000 word book at the precision level of an 800 word thinkpiece would take forever, but also I presume it almost never happens. If it does, that better be your masterpiece or I don\u2019t see why you\u2019d do it.</p>\n<h4>A Useful Tool</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/dwarkesh_sp/status/1882229244010676435\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Dwarkesh Patel is using</a> the <a href=\"https://github.com/glowingjade/obsidian-smart-composer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Smart Composer Plugin for Obsidian</a>, which he says is basically Cursor for writing, and loves it. Sounds great conditional on using Obsidian, but it is not being actively maintained.</p>\n<h4>A Maligned Tool</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/esrtweet/status/1889785599340486802\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Raymond joins \u2018the em-dash debate\u2019 on the side of the em-dash</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Eric Raymond (yes that one): My wacky theory about the em-dash debate:</p>\n<p>Pro writers use em-dashes a lot because many of them, possibly without consciously realizing it, have become elocutionary punctuationists.</p>\n<p>That is, they\u2019ve fallen into the habit of using punctuation not as grammatical phrase structure markers but as indicators of pauses of varying length in the flow of speech.</p>\n<p>The most visible difference you see in people who write in this style that their usage of commas becomes somewhat more fluid &#8212; that\u2019s the marker for the shortest pause. But they also reach for less commonly used punctuation marks as indicators of longer pauses of varying length.</p>\n<p>Em dash is about the second or third longest pause, only an ellipsis or end-of-sentence period being clearly longer.</p>\n<p>Historical note: punctuation marks originally evolved as pause or breathing markers in manuscripts to aid recitation. In the 19th century, after silent reading had become normal, they were reinterpreted by grammarians as phrase structure markers and usage rules became much more rigid.</p>\n<p>Really capable writers have been quietly rediscovering elocutionary punctuation ever since.</p>\n<p>RETVRN!</p></blockquote>\n<p>I too have been increasingly using punctuation, especially commas, to indicate pauses. I still don\u2019t use em dashes, partly because I almost never want that exact length and style of a pause for whatever reason, and also because my instinct is that you\u2019re trying to do both \u2018be technically correct\u2019 and also \u2018evoke what you want\u2019 and my brain thinks of the em-dash as technically incorrect.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s all true and I never used em-dashes before but who are we kidding, the best reason not to use em-dashes is that people will think you\u2019re using AI. I don\u2019t love that dynamic either, but do you actually want to die on that hill?</p>\n<h4>Neglected Topics</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/03/some-reasons-why-i-do-not-cover-various-topics-much.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=some-reasons-why-i-do-not-cover-various-topics-much\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Tyler Cowen lists some reasons why he does not cover various topics much</a>. The list resonates with me quite a bit.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>I feel that writing about the topic will make me stupider.</li>\n<li>I believe that you reading more about the topic will make you stupider.</li>\n<li>I believe that performative outrage usually brings low or negative returns. Matt Yglesias has had some good writing on this lately.</li>\n<li>I don\u2019t have anything to add on the topic. Abortion and the Middle East would be two examples here.</li>\n<li>Sometimes I have good inside information on a topic, but I cannot reveal it, not even without attribution. And I don\u2019t want to write something stupider than my best understanding of the topic.</li>\n<li>I just don\u2019t feel like it.</li>\n<li>On a few topics I feel it is Alex\u2019s province.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don\u2019t have an Alex, instead I have decided on some forms of triage that are simply \u2018I do not have the time to look into this and I will let it be someone else\u2019s department.\u2019</p>\n<p>Otherwise yes, all of these are highly relevant.</p>\n<p>Insider information is tough, and I am very careful about not revealing things I am not supposed to reveal, but this rarely outright stops me. If nothing else, you can usually get net smarter via negativa, where you silently avoid saying false things, including by using careful qualifiers on statements.</p>\n<p>One big thing perhaps missing from Tyler\u2019s list is that I avoid certain topics where my statements would potentially interfere with my ability to productively discuss other topics. If you are going to make enemies, or give people reasons to attack you or dismiss you, only do that on purpose. One could also file this under making you and others stupider. Similarly, there are things that I need to not think about &#8211; I try to avoid thinking about trading for this reason.</p>\n<p>A minor thing is that I\u2019d love to be able to talk more about gaming, and other topics dear to my heart, but that consistently drive people away permanently when I do that. So it\u2019s just not worth it. If the extra posts simply had no impact, I\u2019d totally do it, but as is I\u2019d be better off writing the post and then not hitting publish. Sad. Whereas Tyler has made it very clear he\u2019s going to post things most readers don\u2019t care about, when he feels like doing so, and that\u2019s part of the price of admission.</p>\n<h4>The Humanities Don\u2019t Seem Relevant To Writing About Future Humanity?</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/orthonormalist/status/1891989206710288626\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">If you want to write or think about the future, maybe don\u2019t study the humanities?</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>Startup Archive: Palmer Luckey explains why science fiction is a great place to look for ideas</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the things that I\u2019ve realized in my career is that nothing I ever come up with will be new. I\u2019ve literally never come up with an idea that a science fiction author has not come up with before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr. Julie Gurner: Funny how valuable those English majors and writers truly are, given how much liberal arts has been put down. Why philosophy, creativity and hard tech skills make such fantastic bedfellows. Span of vision wins.</p>\n<p>Orthonormalist: Heinlein was an aeronautical engineer.</p>\n<p>Asimov was a biochemistry professor.</p>\n<p>Arthur Clarke was a radio operator who got a physics degree.</p>\n<p>Ray Bradbury never went to college (but did go straight to being a writer)</p></blockquote>\n<p>I quote this because \u2018study the humanities\u2019 is a natural thing to say to someone looking to write or think about the future, and yet I agree that when I look at the list of people whose thinking about the future has influenced me, I notice essentially none of them have studied the humanities.</p>\n<h4>Writing Every Day</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.ayjay.org/method-and-madness/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Jacobs has a very different writing pattern</a>. Rather than write every day, he waits until the words are ready, so he\u2019ll work every day but often that means outlines or index card reordering or just sitting in his chair and thinking, even for weeks at a time. This is alien to me. If I need to figure out what to write, I start writing, see what it looks like, maybe delete it and try again, maybe procrastinate by working on a different thing.</p>\n<h4>Writing As Deep Work</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nealstephenson.com/why-i-am-a-bad-correspondent.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Neal Stephenson explains that for him writing is Deep Work</a>, requiring long blocks of reliably uninterrupted time bunched together, writing novels is the best thing he does, and that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t go to conferences or answer your email. Fair enough.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve found ways to not be like that. I deal with context shifts and interruptions all the time and it is fine, indeed when dealing with difficult tasks I almost require them. That\u2019s a lot of how I can be so productive. But the one time I wrote something plausibly like a book, <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/05/23/mazes-sequence-summary/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">the Immoral Mazes sequence</a>, I did spend a week alone in my apartment doing nothing else. And I haven\u2019t figured out how to write a novel, or almost any fiction at all.</p>\n<p>Also, it\u2019s rather sad if it is true that Neal Stephenson only gets a middle class life out of writing so many fantastic and popular books, and can\u2019t afford anyone to answer his email. That makes writing seem like an even rougher business than I expected. Although soon AI can perhaps do it for him?</p>\n<h4>Most Of Your Audience Is Secondhand</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/patio11/status/1955662846874075191\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Patrick McKenzie highlights an insight from Alex Danco</a>, which is that most of the effective audience of any successful post is not people who read the post, but people who are told about the post by someone who did read it. Patrick notes this likely also applies to formal writing, I\u2019d note it seems to definitely apply to most books.</p>\n<p>Relatedly, I have in the past postulated a virtual four-level model of flow of ideas, where each level can understand the level above it, and then rephrase and present it to the level below.</p>\n<p>So if you are Level 1, either in general or in an area, you can formulate fully new ideas. If you are Level 2, you can understand what the Level 1s say, look for consensus or combine what they say, riff on it and then communicate that to those who are up to Level 3, who can then fully communicate to the public who end up typically around at Level 4.</p>\n<p>Then the public will communicate a simplified and garbled version to each other.</p>\n<p>You can be Level 1 and then try to \u2018put on your Level 2 or 3 hat\u2019 to write a dumber, simpler version to a broader audience, but it is very hard to simultaneously do that and also communicate the actual concepts to other Level 1s.</p>\n<p>These all then interact, but if you go viral with anything longer than a Tweet, you inevitably are going to primarily end up with a message primarily communicated via (in context) Level 3 and Level 4 people communicating to other Level 3-4 people.</p>\n<p>At that point, and any time you go truly viral or your communication is \u2018successful,\u2019 you run into the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ZvJab25tDebB8FGE/you-get-about-five-words\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">You Get About Five Words</a> problem.</p>\n<p>My response to this means that at this point I essentially never go all that directly viral. I have a very narrow range of views, where even the top posts never do 100% better than typical posts, and the least popular posts &#8211; which are when I talk about AI alignment or policy on their own &#8211; will do at worst 30% less than typical.</p>\n<p>The way the ideas go viral is someone quotes, runs with or repackages them. A lot of the impact comes from the right statement reaching the right person.</p>\n<p>I presume that would work differently if I was working with mediums that work on virality, such as YouTube or TikTok, but my content seems like a poor fit for them, and when I do somewhat \u2018go viral\u2019 in such places it is rarely content I care about spreading. Perhaps I am making a mistake by not branching out. But on Twitter I still almost never go viral, as it seems my speciality is small TAM (total available market) Tweets.</p>\n<h4>That\u2019s Funny</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/david_perell/status/1926340497057923352\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Never have a character try to be funny</a>, the character themselves should have no idea.</p>\n<p>I think this is directionally correct but goes too far, for the same reasons that you, in your real life, will often try to be funny, and sometimes it will work. The trick is they have to be trying to be funny in a way that makes sense for the character, in context, for those around them, not trying to be funny to the viewer.</p>\n<p>I notice that in general I almost never \u2018try to be funny,\u2019 not exactly. I simply say things because they would be funny, and to say things in the funniest way possible, because why not. A lot of my favorite people seem to act similarly.</p>\n<h4>Fiction Writing Advice</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://lithub.com/lydia-davis-ten-of-my-recommendations-for-good-writing-habits/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Lydia Davis offers her top ten recommendations for good (fiction?) writing</a>: Keep notes, including sentences out of context, work from your own interest, be mostly self-taught, read and revise the notes constantly, grow stories or develop poems out of those notes, learn techniques from great works and read the best writers across time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/orsonscottcard/status/1945130647195963799\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Orson Scott Card explains that you don\u2019t exhaust the reader by having too much tension in your book</a>, you exhaust them by having long stretches without tension. The tension keeps us reading.</p>\n<h4>Just Say The Thing</h4>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/patio11/status/1914393809477083322\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Dwarkesh Patel</a>: Unreasonably effective writing advice:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you trying to say here?</p>\n<p>Okay, just write that.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019ve (separately) started doing this more.</p>\n<p>I try to make sure that it\u2019s very easy to find the central point, the thing I\u2019m most trying to say, and hard to miss it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Patrick McKenzie: Cosigned, and surprisingly effective with good writers in addition to ones who more obviously need the prompting.</p>\n<p>Writing an artifact attaches you to the structure of it while simultaneously subsuming you in the topic. The second is really good for good work; the first, less so.</p>\n<p>One thing that I tried, with very limited success, to get people to do is to be less attached to words on a page. Writing an essay? Write two very different takes on it; different diction, different voice, maybe even different argument. Then pick the one which speaks to you.</p>\n<p>Edit *that* rather than trying to line edit the loser towards greatness.</p>\n<p>There is something which people learn, partially from school and partially from work experience, which causes them to write as if they were charged for every word which goes down on the page.</p>\n<p>Words are free! They belong in a vast mindscape! You can claw more from the aether!</p>\n<p>I think people *might* operationalize better habits after LLMs train them that throwing away a paragraph is basically costless.</p>\n<p>Jason Cohen: Yeah this works all the time.</p>\n<p>Also when getting someone to explain their product, company, customer, why to work for them, etc..</p>\n<p>So funny how it jogs them out of their own way!</p>\n<p>BasedBigTech: An excellent Group PM reviewed my doc with me. He said \u201cwhat does this mean?\u201d and I told him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you write that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kevin Kelly: At Whole Earth Review people would send us book reviews with a cover letter explaining why we should run their book review. We\u2019d usually toss the review and print their much shorter cover letter as the review which was much clearer and succinct.</p>\n<p>Daniel Eth: It\u2019s crazy how well just straight up asking people that gets them to say the thing they should write down</p></blockquote>\n<p>Why does it work?</p>\n<p>The answer is that writing is doing multiple tasks.</p>\n<p>Only one of them is \u2018tell you what all this means.\u2019</p>\n<p>You have to do some combination of things such as justify that, explain it, motivate it, provide details, teach your methods and reasoning, perform reporting, be entertaining and so on.</p>\n<p>Also, how did you know what you meant to say until you wrote the damn thing?</p>\n<p>You still usually should find a way to loudly say what it all means, somewhere in there.</p>\n<p>But this creates the opportunity for the hack.</p>\n<p>If I hand you a ten-page paper, and you ask \u2018what are you trying to say?\u2019 then I have entered into evidence that I have Done the Work and Written the Report.</p>\n<p>Now I can skip the justifications, details and context, and Say The Thing.</p>\n<p>The point of a reference post is sometimes to give people the opportunity to learn.</p>\n<p>The point of a reference post can also be to exist and then not be clicked on. It varies.</p>\n<p>This is closely related to the phenomenon where often a movie or show will have a scene that logically and structurally has to exist, but which you wish you didn\u2019t have to actually watch. In theory you could hold up a card that said \u2018Scene in which Alice goes to the bank, acts nervous and get the money\u2019 or whatever.</p>\n<p>Probably they should do a graceful version of something like that more often, or even interactive versions where you can easily expand or condense various scenes. There\u2019s something there.</p>\n<p>Similarly, with blog posts (or books) there are passages that are written or quoted knowing many or most people will skip them, but that have to be there.</p>\n<h4>Cracking the Paywall</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://aella.substack.com/p/how-to-paywall\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Aella teaches us how to make readers pay up to get behind a Paywall</a>. Explain why you are the One Who Knows some valuable thing, whereas others including your dear reader are bad at this and need your help. Then actually provide value both outside and inside of the paywall, ideally because the early free steps are useful even without the payoff you\u2019re selling.</p>\n<p>I am thankful that I can write without worrying about maximizing such things, while I also recognize that I\u2019m giving up a lot of audience share not optimizing for doing similar things on the non-paywall side.</p>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
