                "<div class=\"trix-content\">\n  <div>As soon as I was old enough to travel on my own, London was where I wanted to go. Compared to Copenhagen at the time, there was something so majestic about Big Ben, Trafalgar Square, and even the Tube around the turn of the millenium. Not just because their capital is twice as old as ours, but because it endured twice as much, through the Blitz and the rest of it, yet never lost its nerve. I thought I might move there one day.</div><div><br />That was then. Now, I wouldn't dream of it. London is no longer the city I was infatuated with in the late '90s and early 2000s. Chiefly because it's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_London\">no longer full of native Brits</a>. In 2000, more than sixty percent of the city were native Brits. By 2024, that had dropped to about a third. A statistic as evident as day when you walk the streets of London now.<br /><br /></div><div>Copenhagen, by comparison, was about eighty-five percent native Danes in 2000, and is still three-quarters today. Enough of a foreign presence to feel cosmopolitan, but still distinctly Danish in all of its ways. Equally statistically evident on streets and bike lanes.</div><div><br />But I think, what would Copenhagen feel like, if only a third of it was Danish, like London? It would feel completely foreign, of course. Alien, even. So I get the frustration that many Brits have with the way mass immigration has changed the culture and makeup of not just London, but their whole country.</div><div><br />That frustration was on wide display in <a href=\"https://x.com/hashtag/FreedomMarch\">Tommy Robinson's march</a> yesterday. British and English flags flying high and proud, like they would in Copenhagen on the day of a national soccer match. Which was both odd to see but also heartwarming. You can sometimes be forgiven for thinking that all of Britain is lost in self-loathing, shame, and suicidal empathy. But of course it's not.<br /><br /></div><div>Recently, <a href=\"https://politiken.dk/danmark/art10414206/I-2096-kan-flertallet-i-Danmark-v%C3%A6re-indvandrere-eller-efterkommere#:~:text=I%202096%20vil%20der%20v%C3%A6re,indvandringstal%20forts%C3%A6tter%20pr%C3%A6cis%20som%20nu.\">a projection that Danes would be a minority in their own country by 2096</a> caused an enormous stir in Denmark. Politicians across the spectrum decried what a catastrophe that would be for this world's oldest continuous monarchy. But a demographic nightmare worse than that has already enveloped London!</div><div><br />So it's tough to blame the Brits for being pissed. No matter how hard they voted one way or the other, Brexit or no Brexit, the erosion of their national identity kept marching forward at an ever-greater pace. Not due to some unavoidable cosmic destiny, but due to equal parts policy and apathy. The boats kept coming, the <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/government-struggling-to-reduce-migrant-hotel-use-as-asylum-claims-hit-record-level-13415697\">migrant hotels kept expanding</a>, and the British authorities kept cracking down on anyone who dared criticize that trajectory or the present-day reality.<br /><br /></div><div>Which brings us back to Robinson's powerful march yesterday. The banner said \"March for Freedom\", and focused as much on that now distant-to-the-Brits concept of free speech, as it did on restoring national pride.</div><div><br />And for good reason! The totalitarian descent into censorious darkness in Britain has been as swift as its demographic shift. British police are now making <a href=\"https://freespeechunion.org/police-make-30-arrests-a-day-for-offensive-online-messages/\"><em>30 arrests a day</em></a> for wrongthink, wrongspeech, and other online transgressions against \"the regime narrative\", as the BBC would have reported, if this were a statistic from a foreign nation.<br /><br /></div><div>Most recently, five officers(!) came to arrest comedian Graham Linehan for illicit tweets. When much of the media reports a story like this, it's often without citing the specific words in question, such that the reader might imagine something far worse than what was actually said. So you should actually <a href=\"https://grahamlinehan.substack.com/p/i-just-got-arrested-again\">read the three tweets</a> that landed Linehan in jail, and earned him a legal restraining order against using X. It's grotesque. &nbsp;</div><div><br />The easy way out of this uncomfortably <a href=\"https://x.com/TRobinsonNewEra/status/1967299244026630608\">large gathering of perfectly normal, peaceful Brits</a> who've had enough is to tar them all as \"far right\". That's not just a British tactic, but one used across Europe, and previously in the US as well. It used to work very well, because the historical stigma was so strong, but, like hurling \"nazi\" and \"fascist\" at the most middle-of-the-road political figures and positions, it's finally lost its power.&nbsp;<br /><br /></div><div>I really feel for the Brits because it's not obvious how they get themselves out of this pickle. They're still reeling from <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2025/06/18/the-grooming-gangs-scandal-is-a-stain-on-the-british-state\">the Pakistani rape gangs</a> that were left free to terrorize cities like Rotherham and Rochdale for years on end with horror-movie-like scenes of the most despicable, depraved abuse of British girls. Unlike Linehan's tweets, I actually implore you not to peruse these stories too closely, though, because they'll make you sick. So how do you even begin to correct course?<br /><br /></div><div>I don't know. But I'm glad that there clearly are many Brits who are determined to find out. Unwilling to just let their society wither away while their bobbies chase bad tweets instead of <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/mobile-phone-theft-london-met-police-b1244212.html\">the rampant street thefts</a> or those barbaric rape gangs. Unwilling to resign the rest of the country to the kind of demographic replacement that befell London over the last two decades.<br /><br /></div><div>You can rest assured that I'd be in the streets waving a Danish flag if these were my conditions in my native country. I think that's a pretty universal sentiment. There's absolutely nothing racist or xenophobic in saying that Denmark is primarily a country for the Danes, Britain primarily a united kingdom for the Brits, and Japan primarily a set of islands for the Japanese.<br /><br /></div><div>Here's how the Danish Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen of the Social Democrats, recently put it <a href=\"https://politiken.dk/danmark/politik/art10545758/%C2%BBPr%C3%B8v-at-sige-s%C3%A6tningen.-Folk-tror-jo-det-er-l%C3%B8gn%C2%AB\">in an interview</a>:<br /><br /></div><blockquote><em>There are really a lot of us Danes who believed that when people came to this \u2018world\u2019s best country\u2019 and were given such good opportunities, they would integrate. They would become Danish, and they would never, ever harm our society. All of us who thought that way have been wrong.</em></blockquote><div><br />This is the challenge before not just the British establishment, but much of the European one too: To come to the realization of the Danish Prime Minister. Someone nobody could credibly charge with being \"far right\".<br /><br /></div><div>Which should give the Brits some solace. The Social Democrats in Denmark were once staunch believers in unfettered immigration and thought it dirty to even talk about <a href=\"https://x.com/jonatanpallesen/status/1845525384407953560\">the problems</a>, but eventually reality and public pressure led them to better ideas. Why shouldn't that be possible in the UK?&nbsp;<br /><br /></div><div>Don't give up. You survived the Blitz. Britain will be back.<br /><br />  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--jpeg\">\n      <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/e7d38e64/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjI2Mzc5MjkzOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ--8d1b4309a3d813b00a54fbbb2eb04acf72d8a097be594870dab6db32be5191b9/london-flags.jpeg?disposition=attachment\" title=\"Download london-flags.jpeg\">\n        <img alt=\"london-flags.jpeg\" src=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/e7d38e64/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjI2Mzc5MjkzOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ--8d1b4309a3d813b00a54fbbb2eb04acf72d8a097be594870dab6db32be5191b9/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6eyJmb3JtYXQiOiJqcGVnIiwicmVzaXplX3RvX2xpbWl0IjpbMzg0MCwyNTYwXSwicXVhbGl0eSI6NjAsImxvYWRlciI6eyJwYWdlIjpudWxsfSwiY29hbGVzY2UiOnRydWV9LCJwdXIiOiJ2YXJpYXRpb24ifX0--86fa621099aa99aa0c7ae156d97d21b387d30fa6ac57aa5c89948af503464a06/london-flags.jpeg\" />\n</a>\n  </figure><br /><br /></div>\n</div>"

                "<h3 id=\"about-that-mit-report\">About that MIT report\u2026</h3>\n\n<p>Last month, the internet was abuzz about an MIT report with a dramatic headline: \u201c<em>95% of generative AI pilots at companies are failing</em>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Fortune <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/\">had the exclusive</a>, and paywalled the write up. The report itself, published by MIT\u2019s NANDA<sup id=\"fnref:nanda\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/09/15/ai-adoption-at-work-play.html#fn:nanda\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8rU8OpQWU44gYDeZyINUZjBFwu--1uTbxixK_PRSVrfaH8Q/viewform\">could only be accessed by filling out a Google Form</a>. I don\u2019t think many people actually read the report, but the headline was enough. Here\u2019s what happened the next day:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Shares of megacap tech and big-name chipmakers declined. Nvidia shares lost 3.5%, while Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom slipped 5.4% and 3.6%, respectively. Shares of high-flying software stock Palantir dropped more than 9%, making it the S&amp;P 500\u2032s worst performer. Other major tech-related names such as Tesla, Meta Platforms, and Netflix were also under pressure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since then, many have <a href=\"https://www.futuriom.com/articles/news/why-we-dont-believe-mit-nandas-werid-ai-study/2025/08\">criticized the methodology and conclusions of the report</a>. Too few executives were surveyed, those that were didn\u2019t represent the entire market, and the report (on the whole) reads as an advertisement for NANDA\u2019s mission rather than a peer-reviewed research paper (because it\u2019s not).</p>\n\n<p>Someone could probably start a pretty good investment fund that just <em>reads the papers</em> behind the headlines that move the market.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>You can read the actual report <a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai_report_2025.pdf\">here</a>, without filling out any Google Forms. It\u2019s worth skimming, as there are a few datapoints more interesting than the headline claim.</p>\n\n<p>From those, I want to highlight these two figures (emphasis mine):</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/img/nanda_chart.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>For all the criticism of the NANDA report, it <em>is</em> a survey of many business leaders. We can treat it as such. So while we might take that 95% figure with a grain of salt, we <em>can</em> trust that business leaders <em>believe</em> the biggest reason their AI pilots are failing is because their employees are unwilling to adopt new tools\u2026 While 90% of employees surveyed eagerly use AI tools they procure themselves.</p>\n\n<p>A Simpson\u2019s classic comes to mind:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"&quot;Am I out of touch? No, it's the children who are wrong.&quot; \u2013 Seymore Skinner\" src=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/img/skinner_children.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>The subject of employees using their own ChatGPT or Claude accounts at work has been heavily discussed for years. It\u2019s frequently referred to as the \u201cShadow AI Economy,\u201d and is a source of anxiety for IT leaders and inside counsel.</p>\n\n<p>Just this week, OpenAI <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w34255\">published a paper on ChatGPT usage</a> that validates this specter:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/img/chatgpt_work_usage.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>OpenAI\u2019s report is excellent and provides a rare look at how people use ChatGPT<sup id=\"fnref:claude\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/09/15/ai-adoption-at-work-play.html#fn:claude\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>: ~80% of usage is for learning, searching, and writing. Often to help them perform their work!</p>\n\n<p>Thinking about the two plots above, I am reminded of the iPhone\u2019s arrival in the enterprise. When the iPhone arrived, it was not seen as a work device. IT organizations continued to provide BlackBerrys, with their IT-controlled <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Technology\">email and messaging</a>. Nearly all IT teams didn\u2019t think this would change. More than once, I heard IT managers reply to iPhone support requests with, \u201cJust wait for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry_Storm\">BlackBerry Storm</a>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But you know who loved iPhones? The C-suite. And they asked their IT leaders to support the device. IT caved, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/2297842/byod-you-ain-t-seen-nothing-yet-2.html\">Bring Your Own Device</a>\u201d became a thing, and four years later <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/16/technology/businesses-too-have-eyes-for-ipads-and-iphones.html\">Apple was an option in the enterprise</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Which brings us back to the charts above: employees are using ChatGPT while managers grumble that their AI projects aren\u2019t adopted. If I had to guess, I\u2019d wager there are a few things going on:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Most companies adopt AI products slowly, bottlenecked by legal and security.</strong> There\u2019s a reason you see Llama 3.1 continue to show up in McKinsey surveys: once teams win approval to use a model, they are loath to go back to compliance to seek an upgrade. New models emerge monthly, but security reviews take <em>many months</em>. This applies to AI applications as well: if a company buys one and employees tell them it\u2019s not great, no one\u2019s eager to take on legal again.</li>\n  <li><strong>Bundle deals are poor substitutes for great chatbots.</strong> I\u2019ve heard from many friends that their workplace-provided chatbot were selected for security and trust reasons (think Microsoft Copilot and others). Rather than wrestle with bad UX or bad answers, these people opt for BYOAI (bring your own AI), IT concerns be damned.</li>\n  <li><strong>It\u2019s hard to separate personal from business use.</strong> This is a classic IT problem: when people can\u2019t be bothered to switch accounts before asking a question. We see it with email, browsing, and more. Savvier users quarantine accounts in separate browsers, but most people just use what\u2019s there.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The topic deserves further study \u2013 I don\u2019t think this will be as easy as the iPhone and BYOD was. But I do think the dominant bottleneck here is IT and compliance. If enterprises don\u2019t stand up continual review processes, they\u2019ll be doomed to be stuck with last year\u2019s tools and models\u2026 Then wonder why no one is adopting their AI.</p>\n\n<p>Until then: employees will continue to opt for BYOAI.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<form action=\"https://buttondown.com/api/emails/embed-subscribe/dbreunig\" class=\"embeddable-buttondown-form\" method=\"post\" target=\"popupwindow\">\n  <label for=\"bd-email\">Enter your email to receive the occasional update.</label>\n  <div class=\"form-input\">\n    <input id=\"bd-email\" name=\"email\" type=\"email\" />\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Subscribe\" />\n  </div>\n</form>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:nanda\">\n      <p>NANDA stands for, \u201cNetworked AI Agents in Decentralized Archtecture.\u201d\u00a0<a class=\"reversefootnote\" href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/09/15/ai-adoption-at-work-play.html#fnref:nanda\">&#8617;</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li id=\"fn:claude\">\n      <p>To Anthropic\u2019s credit, they\u2019ve <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/economic-index\">already published several usage reports</a>.\u00a0<a class=\"reversefootnote\" href=\"https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/09/15/ai-adoption-at-work-play.html#fnref:claude\">&#8617;</a></p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n</div>"

If someone is being helpful, ensure they are better off for having been helpful, even if they have previously been unhelpful and this gives you an opportunity. Reward actions you want to happen more often. Punish actions you want to happen less often. In particular beware situations where you punish clarity and reward implicitness.</p>\n<div>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-24720\"></span>\n\n\n</div>\n<p>Another important rule would be <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1965681129404703206\">that contra Elon Musk here</a> you shouldn\u2019t \u2018sue into oblivion\u2019 or \u2018ostracize from society\u2019 anyone or any organization who advocated for something you disagree with, even if it plausibly led to a bad thing happening.</p>\n<p>Even more importantly: When someone disagrees with you, you don\u2019t use the law to silence them and you most definitely don\u2019t choose violence. Argument gets counterargument. Never bullet, no arrest, no fine, always counterargument. I don\u2019t care what they are advocating for, up to and including things that could plausibly lead to everyone dying. It does not matter. No violence. No killing people. No tolerance of those who think they can have a little violence or killing people who disagree with them, as a treat, or because someone on the other side did it. No. Stop it.</p>\n<p>This seems like one of those times where one has to, once again, say this.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bad News</h4>\n\n\n<p>This seems like a lot of percents?</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/bdomenech/status/1957043590435348556\">Benjamin Domenech</a>: New death of the West stat: 42 percent of people in line to meet Buzz Lightyear at Disney theme parks last year were childless adults.</p>\n<p>Source: author A.J. Wolfe on Puck&#8217;s The Town podcast.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/politicalmath/status/1957044897569206555\">PoliMath</a>: When I went to Disney in 2019, my kids were in line to meet Sleeping Beauty and the guy in front of us was a 30ish single dude who gave her a bouquet of roses and weirdly fawned over her. I admired the actress for not displaying her disgust.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If that is who gets the most value out of meet and greets, okay then. It also presumably isn\u2019t as bad as it sounds since it has been a long time since Buzz Lightyear has been so hot right now, I presume characters in recent movies have a different balance. The price sounds sufficiently high that they should add more copies of such characters for meet and greets until the lines are a lot shorter? How could that not raise profits long term?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/KelseyTuoc/status/1957167201506779140\">Some notes from Kelsey Piper on literary fiction.</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>A-100 Gecs (1m views): the pearl-clutching about no young white men being published in The New Yorker is so funny like men, writ large, are basically a sub-literate population in the US. men do not read literary fiction. if you have even a passing interaction with publishing you realize this.</p>\n<p>Kelsey Piper:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open disdain for people on the basis of their sex is bigoted and bad.</li>\n<li>Men obviously did read and write literary fiction for most of the history of literary fiction; so, if that has changed, I wonder why it has changed! Perhaps something to do with the open disdain!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Like in general, I try not to waste too much of my time on \u201cthis hobby has too few Xs\u201d or \u201cthis hobby has too few Ys,\u201d since that can happen totally organically, and pearl-clutching rarely helps.</p>\n<p>However, if the hobbyists are saying \u201cour hobby has no men because they are a \u2018subliterate population,\u2019\u201d then I suddenly form a strong suspicion about why their hobby has no men, and it\u2019s not that people innocently have different interests sometimes.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/robertwiblin/status/1957757503678107684\">John Murdoch gives us many great charts in the FT</a>, but often we lack key context and detail, because as John explains he only has very limited space and 700 words and everything needs to be parsable by a general audience, so spending space on methodology or a full y-axis is very expensive.

It would still be great to have the Professional Epistemically Ideal Edition available somewhere, any chance we can do that?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/08/the-decline-in-reading-for-pleasure.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-decline-in-reading-for-pleasure\">Reading books for pleasure continues to decline by roughly 3% per year</a>. Alternatives are improving, while books are not improving, indeed the best books to read are mostly old books. So what else would you expect? Until recently I would say people are still reading more because a lot of screen use is reading, but now we have the rise of inane short form video.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/sep/04/quit-lying-white-lies\">Madeleine Aggeler figures out very basic reasons</a> why you might want to not be constantly lying, and that she would be better off if she stopped lying constantly and that you really can tell people when you don\u2019t want to do something, yet she fails to figure out that not lying does not require radical honesty. You can, and often should, provide only the information needed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/nntaleb/status/1960283572671021099\">The IQ tests we have are drawn from a compact pool of question types and so can, unsurprisingly, be trained for and gamed</a>. If you want to raise the result of your IQ test this way, you can totally do that. Goodhart\u2019s Law strikes again. That doesn\u2019t mean IQ is not a real or useful thing, or that these tests are not useful measures. It only means that if you want to make the (usually low-IQ) move of pretending to be higher IQ than you are by gaming the test, you can do that. So you need to not give people strong incentive to game the tests.</p>\n<p>I often hear discussion of \u2018masking\u2019 where autistics learn how to fake not being autistic and seem like normies, or similarly <a href=\"https://x.com/SilverVVulpes/status/1960334243487232403\">where sociopaths learn not to act like sociopaths (in the clinical sense, not the Rao Gervais Principle sense) and seem like normies</a>, because they realize that works out better for them. I mention this because I notice I rarely hear mention of the fact that (AIUI) the normies are mostly doing the same exact thing, except that they more completely Become The Mask and don\u2019t see it as a strange or unfair or bad thing to do this kind of ubiquitous mimicry, and instead do it instinctively?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/PaulSkallas/status/1961512072094560289\">There is an obvious incentive problem here</a>, very central and common.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Eugyppius: when you\u2019re with girl, do not quietly remove bugs. call her attention to bugs first, then heroically remove them for her. they love this.</p>\n<p>Lindy Man: This is also good advice for the workplace. Never fix anything quietly.</p>\n<p>Sean Kelly: When I discover a bug and figure out the solution, I don&#8217;t fix it.</p>\n<p>I have an accomplice report it and play up how bad it is in the stand up.</p>\n<p>Then I sagely chime in, &#8220;I bet I can figure that one out.\u201d</p>\n<p>If the bug looks tough, the accomplice suggests the H-1B with the shortest queue.</p>\n<p>Caroline: People will fix things quietly and then complain they\u2019re underappreciated. Does anyone even know what you did? lol</p>\n<p>Kyle Junlong: ah yes, &#8220;half the work is showing your work.&#8221;</p>\n<p>honestly this is so powerful. i&#8217;m realizing how valuable communication and visibility is, not just in work but in relationships and life.</p>\n<p>i used to think managing other people&#8217;s perception of me was stupid and frivolous, but now i realize how *i* judge other people is solely based on my perception (eg., the convenient information) i have of them. so of course it makes sense to present myself well, because i like those who do present themselves well to me.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Over time, if you don\u2019t take credit for things, people notice that you silently fix or accomplish or improve things without taking credit or bothering anyone about it, and you get triple credit, for fixing things, for doing it seamlessly and for not needing or requesting credit. The problem is, you need a sufficiently sustained and observed set of interactions, and people sufficiently aware of the incentive dynamics here, so that you can move the whole thing up a meta level.</p>\n<p>There is also the reverse. If you know someone who will always loudly take credit, you know that at most they are doing the things they loudly take credit for. If that.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Inequality Within Salient Comparables</h4>\n\n\n<p>I am generally skeptical that we should worried about inequality, as opposed to trying to make people better off. One danger that I am convinced by is that <a href=\"https://x.com/davidmanheim/status/1964601397493805546\">extreme inequality that is directly in your fac</a>e can damage your mental health, if you see yourself in competition with everyone on the spectrum rather than being a satisficer or looking at your absolute level of wealth and power.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/goodalexander/status/1958858220060963274\">Good Alexander:</a> I think the main reason you find a lot of very unhappy tech people even at the highest levels</p>\n<p>&#8211; when you&#8217;re a typical employee everyone around you is making .5-2x what you are</p>\n<p>&#8211; when you start breaking out wealth goes on log scale. ppl with 10-1000x your net worth become common</p>\n<p>&#8211; this is native to network effects, scale associated with AI training, and other winner take all dynamics in tech</p>\n<p>&#8211; all of VC is structured this way as well &#8212; (1 unicorn returns entire fund rest of investments are zero) which psychologically reinforces all or nothing thinking</p>\n<p>&#8211; this makes competitive people miserable</p>\n<p>&#8211; this leads them to do hallucinogens or other psychoactive substances in order to accept their place in the universe</p>\n<p>&#8211; the conclusions drawn from these psychoactive substances are typically at direct odds with how they got to where they are</p>\n<p>&#8211; and after getting one shotted they&#8217;re still ultimately in a hard wired competition with people worth 10-1000x more than them</p>\n<p>&#8211; due to the structure of technology it becomes more or less impossible to break out of your &#8216;bracket&#8217; without engaging in increasingly dark things</p>\n<p>&#8211; you realize that time is running out &#8212; and become aware of synthetic biology (peptides, genetic alteration of children)</p>\n<p>&#8211; you end up getting involved in police state investments, gooning investments, or crypto &#8212; and view it as non optional to take the gloves off bc everyone around you is doing the same thing</p>\n<p>&#8211; you&#8217;re on a permanent hedonic treadmill and you can&#8217;t ever get off or go back to where you were before bc after doing all of the things you&#8217;ve done you can&#8217;t possibly ever relate to normal humans</p>\n<p>&#8211; you get involved with politics or Catholicism or other Lindy cults to try and get off the treadmill</p>\n<p>&#8211; of course it won&#8217;t work and you bring all the weird baggage directly into politics or religion and poison those wells too</p>\n<p>the current configuration of economics/ wealth distribution is pretty solidly optimized to drive the wealthiest people in society batshit insane, which &#8211; to some extent &#8211; explains a lot of things you see around you</p>\n<p>w this framework you can understand:</p>\n<p>* Thiel Antichrist obsession</p>\n<p>* Kanye getting into Hitler and launching a coin</p>\n<p>* Trump memeing himself into becoming President then running again to escape imprisonment</p>\n<p>* Elon generating Ani goon slop on the TL</p>\n<p>* A16z wilding out</p>\n<p>Eliezer Yudkowsky: &#8211; supposed &#8220;AI safety&#8221; guys (outside MIRI) founding AI companies, some of whom got billions for betraying Good and Law.</p>\n<p>I have felt a little pressure to feel insane about that, but it is small compared to all the other antisanity pressures I&#8217;ve resisted routinely.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/davidmanheim/status/1964601397493805546\">David Manheim</a>: This is definitely not wrong, even though it&#8217;s incomplete:</p>\n<p>&#8220;the current configuration of economics/ wealth distribution is pretty solidly optimized to drive the wealthiest people in society batshit insane, which &#8211; to some extent &#8211; explains a lot of things you see around you&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Speaking from experience, it is quite the trip to be in regular contact and debates with various billionaires. It can definitely make one feel like a failure or like it\u2019s time to make more money, even though I have enough money to not worry about money, especially when you think you definitely could have joined them by making different life choices, and there\u2019s a chance I still could. Whereas, when in prior phases of life I was not in such contact, it was easy not to care about any of that.</p>\n<p>It helps to remind myself periodically that if I had a billion dollars, I could make the world a better place, but except insofar as I prevented us all from dying my own life would, I anticipate, not actually be better as a result. At that level, there isn\u2019t that much more utility to buy, whereas <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYzrSGRzttk&amp;pp=ygUYbW9yZSBtb25leSBtb3JlIHByb2JsZW1z\">more money, more problems.</a></p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Artful Dodge</h4>\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not easy buying art.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/coldhealing/status/1956730079163060612\">cold</a>: Bro you make $500k at OpenAI you can go to the art fair and buy a little $10,000 painting to hang up in your SF apartment&#8217;s living room</p>\n<p>You tell them this and then they&#8217;ll be like &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry <img alt=\"\ud83e\udd7a\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f97a.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /> do you think a $15,000 desert meditation retreat will fix me so I&#8217;m not like this anymore??&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/paulg/status/1956851810167308464\">Daniel</a>: The lack of personal art purchasing in SF is insane. A $3000 oil on canvas can change your whole living room and they won\u2019t do it.</p>\n<p>I know people who earn much more than $500k at openai and their living rooms are making them depressed.</p>\n<p>Paul Graham: The main reason rich people in SV don&#8217;t buy art is that it does actually take some expertise to do it well. And since the kind of people who get rich in SV hate to do things badly, and don&#8217;t have time to learn about art now, they do nothing.</p>\n<p>diffTTT: Rich SV people need an expert to tell them what kind of art they like?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/paulg/status/1956851810167308464\">Paul Graham</a>: In a way. They need to learn how not to be fooled by meretricious art, how to avoid the immense influence of hype and fashion, etc. Most people have to figure this out for themselves or from books, but a truly competent expert could help.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If it takes some expertise to buy art well, that is a real problem with buying art. The thing is, if you do not buy art well, you will lose most of the money you spent on art, and also you will look like a fool, and also the art will not make you feel better or much improve your living room.</p>\n<p>That leaves four options.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The one these people and I have taken, which is to not buy art.</li>\n<li>Buy cheap art that you don\u2019t mind looking at. Safe, but still annoying to do, and then you have to look at it, does it actually make you feel better?</li>\n<li>Spend a lot of time figuring out how to buy expensive art properly. Yeah, no. I understand that Paul Graham can be in renaissance man mode, but if you are coding at OpenAI at $500k+ per year the cost of this is very, very high, and also you probably don\u2019t expect the skill to stay relevant for long.</li>\n<li>Find someone you trust to do it for you? Not cheap, not all that easy or quick to do either, and you are still the one who has to look at the damn thing.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Besides, who is to say that a constant piece of artwork actually helps, especially if it doesn\u2019t hold particular meaning to you? I mean, yeah, in theory yeah we should get some artwork here, I suppose, but no one wants to do the work involved, also it should definitely be cheap art. At one point I bought some Magic: The Gathering prints for this but we never got around to hanging them.</p>\n<p>Also at one point I tried to buy the original art for Horn of Greed, which at the time would have cost like $3k. I say tried because my wife wouldn\u2019t let me, but if anyone wants to buy me a gift at some point, that or another original Magic art I\u2019d look back on fondly seems great.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Whether Weather</h4>\n\n\n<p>If there is one thing to learn from rationality: Peter Wildeford is 100% right here.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_bias\">Wikipedia (Wet Bias)</a>: <strong>Wet bias</strong> is the phenomenon whereby some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting\">weather forecasters</a> report an overestimated and exaggerated probability of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation\">precipitation</a> to increase the usefulness and actionability of their forecast.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weather_Channel\">The Weather Channel</a> has been empirically shown, and has also admitted, to having a wet bias in the case of low probability of precipitation (for instance, a 5% probability may be reported as a 20% probability) but not at high probabilities of precipitation (so a 60% probability will be reported as a 60% probability).</p>\n<p>Some local television stations have been shown as having significantly greater wet bias, often reporting a 100% probability of precipitation in cases where it rains only 70% of the time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/peterwildeford/status/1960327378808307911\">Colin Fraser</a>: If you believe it will rain with probability P, and getting caught in the rain without an umbrella is X times worse than getting caught in the sun with an umbrella, then it&#8217;s optimal to predict rain whenever P \u2265 1/(1+X). So e.g. for X=2 you should predict rain at P \u2265 1/3.</p>\n<p>Peter Wildeford: I think you should only predict rain according to the correct p(rain), but you can change your behavior around umbrella carrying at lower values of p(rain).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Colin Fraser is right if you effectively can only predict 0% or 100% rain, and the only purpose of predicting rain is that you take an umbrella if and only if you predict rain.</p>\n<p>Peter Wildeford is right that you can say \u2018it will rain 40% of the time, therefore I should take an umbrella, even though more than half the time I will look foolish.\u2019</p>\n<p>The weather reports are assuming that people have a typical bias, that people respect 40% chance or more, but not 30%. Thus, there is a huge jump (AIUI, and Claude confirms). If the Google weather app says 30%, treat that as at most 10%, but the app doesn\u2019t want to get blamed so it hedges. Whereas if it says 40%? That\u2019s pretty much 40%, act accordingly.</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t know the way the conversion works, and you don\u2019t have the typical biases, you\u2019ll respond in crazy wrong fashion. The bias and nonlinearity become self-perpetuating.</p>\n<p>The right rule in practice really is to take the umbrella at 40% and not at 30%, almost no matter what the cost-benefit tradeoff is for the umbrella, since it is obviously wise at 40% and obviously unwise at 10%.</p>\n<p>The \u2018predict 100% instead of 70%\u2019 thing that other sources do is especially maddening. This means both that you can\u2019t tell the difference between 70% and 100%, and that on the regular you notice things that were predicted as Can\u2019t Happen actually happening. The weather forecaster is consigned to Bayes Hell and you can\u2019t trust them at all.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">If You\u2019re So Smart, Why Aren\u2019t You Happy?</h4>\n\n\n<p>As Bryan Caplan notes, this is frequently a better question than \u2018if you\u2019re so smart, why aren\u2019t you rich?\u2019 It is a very good question.</p>\n<p>His rejections of various responses are less convincing, with many being highly oversimplifying and dismissive of many things people often care about deeply. He presents answers as if they were easy and obvious when they are neither of those things.</p>\n<p>I endorse rejection of the objection \u2018the world is so awful that you have to be stupid to be happy.\u2019 I don\u2019t endorse his reasoning for doing so. I do agree with him that the world is in a great spot right now (aside from existential risks), but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the point. The point is that it isn\u2019t improving your life or anyone else\u2019s to let your view of the world\u2019s overall state make you indefinitely unhappy. If you think you \u2018have\u2019 to be stupid not to be perpetually unhappy for whatever external reason, you\u2019re wrong.</p>\n<p>I also agree with him that one good reason to not be happy is that you are prioritizing something else. He retorts that few people are extreme Effective Altruists, but this is not required. You don\u2019t have to be some fanatic, to use his example, to miserably stay together for the kids. What you care about can be anything, including personal achievements other than happiness. Who says you have to care about happy? Indeed, I see a lot of people not prioritizing happiness enough, and I see a lot of other people prioritizing it far too much.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s also another answer, which is that some people have low happiness set points or chemical imbalances or other forms of mental problems that make it extremely difficult for them to be happy. That\u2019s one of the ways in which one can have what Bryan calls \u2018extraordinary bad luck\u2019 that you can\u2019t overcome, but there are other obvious ways as well.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">While I Cannot Condone This</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/metzgov/status/1962923853971169663\">\u2018Digital Content Creators\u2019 joins the list of professions</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/aPGwe6esWq\">that officially face</a> \u2018no tax on tips.\u2019 Influencers and podcasters are explicitly getting a tax break.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WUQk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f0e1fd2-e628-48c2-98bf-1850cae465bd_1200x574.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>From a public choice standpoint I suppose this was inevitable.

They spent a huge percentage of their income on clothes, they spent a large percentage of their time and attention on understanding, creating and maintaining those clothes, and they were willing to suffer a lot of discomfort. And they faced huge social and status pressures to devote such efforts, with large punishments for not measuring up to norms.</p>\n<p>Derek notes our reduced tolerance for discomfort and lack of effort, but skips over all the extra money and time and cognitive investments, seems to lack the \u2018and this is good, actually\u2019 that I would add.

It is also hard to be rich effectively, including in terms of turning that extra money into better lived experiences, and \u2018use the money to change the world\u2019 is even harder.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Roon: its amazing how little the post-economic people i know spend. many people are bad at being rich. you should teach them how to do it.</p>\n<p>i think this is often why the children of the mega-rich are the ones who even get close to squandering their parents&#8217; fortunes. when you get rich later into life you often don&#8217;t think with enough 0s in terms of personal consumption, donations, having a lavish household staff etc.</p>\n<p>Eliezer Yudkowsky: In their defense, once you&#8217;ve already got your personal chef, volcano lair with trampoline, and a harem that covers all your kinks, there&#8217;s just not much else Earth offers for converting money to hedons.</p>\n<p>Zvi Mowshowitz: It is remarkably difficult (and time consuming!) to spend large amounts of money in ways that actually make your life better, if you&#8217;re not into related status games.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I got into a number of arguments in the comments, including with people who thought a remarkably small amount of money was a \u2018large amount.\u2019 Certainly you can usefully spend substantially more than most people are able to spend and still see gains.</p>\n<p>Reasonably quickly you hit a wall, and the Andy Warhol \u2018everyone gets the same Diet Coke\u2019 problem, and to do better you have to spend obscene amounts for not that much improvement. Are you actually going to be that much happier with a giant yacht or a private jet? What good is that private chef compared to Caviar or going to restaurants? Do you actually want to live farther away in some mansion? Does expensive art do anything for you cheap art doesn\u2019t? And so on.</p>\n<p>Even in the ways that would be good to spend more, you still need to know how to spend more and get value from what you paid, and how to do it without it taking up a ton of your time, attention or stress. Again, this is harder than it sounds.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">China Has Declining Marginal Product Of Capital</h4>\n\n\n<p>We talk constantly about \u2018losing to China\u2019 whereas in China there are reasons to worry that China is losing, not to an outside force but rather in general, and this is on top of a fertility rate that is 1.1 or below and an already declining population:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/Birdyword/status/1963556276455014901\">Mike Bird</a>: Useful chart from @andrewbatson here covering one of the most under-discussed and useful macro metrics around.

One existence proof is that there are very clearly regimes, policies and circumstances that make people very unhappy, and you can do the opposite of those things, at least dodging them.</p>\n<p>Also there are things that consistently raise happiness and that vary in frequency greatly over time, for example being married and having grandchildren.</p>\n<p>In any case, <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/08/is-it-possible-to-raise-national-happiness.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=is-it-possible-to-raise-national-happiness\">via MR</a> <a href=\"https://www.nationalaffairs.com/blog/detail/findings-a-daily-roundup/welcoming-the-input\">(via Kevin Lewis</a>) we have <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5339511\">a new paper.</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>Abstract: We revisit the famous Easterlin paradox by considering that life evaluation scales refer to a changing context, hence they are regularly reinterpreted.</p>\n<p>We propose a simple model of rescaling based on both retrospective and current life evaluations, and apply it to unexploited archival data from the USA.</p>\n<p>When correcting for rescaling, we find that the well-being of Americans has substantially increased, on par with GDP, health, education, and liberal democracy, from the 1950s to the early 2000s.</p>\n<p>Using several datasets, we shed light on other happiness puzzles, including the apparent stability of life evaluations during COVID-19, why Ukrainians report similar levels of life satisfaction today as before the war, and the absence of parental happiness.</p>\n<p>Tyler Cowen: To give some intuition, the authors provide evidence that people are more likely engaging in rescaling than being stuck on a hedonic treadmill. I think they are mostly right.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This makes tons of sense to me. You get revolutions of rising expectations. There are definitely positional effects and treadmill effects and baseline happiness set points and all that to deal with, but the Easterlin Paradox is a paradox for a reason and things other than income vary as well.</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean life is getting better or people are getting happier. It can also go the other way, and I am very open to the idea that happiness could be declining (or not) in the smartphone era with kids not allowed to breathe outside, and everything else that causes people to feel bad these days both for good and bad reasons. But yeah, from the 1950s to the 1990s things seem like they very clearly got better (you could also say from the 1500s to 1990s, with notably brief exceptions, or earlier, and I\u2019d still agree).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/style/adult-sleepaway-camp-social-getaway-98e47886\">Camp Social is part of a category of offerings where adults go to sleepaway camp</a> with a focus on making friends, complete with bunk beds and color wars and in one case a claimed 75% return rate, although also with staying up until 1:30 getting drunk.

Cost is $884 for two nights and three days, which seems rather quick for what you want to accomplish?</p>\n<p>I do buy that this is a good idea.</p>\n<p>Radiation is dangerous, but it is a lot less dangerous than people make it out to be, and we treat this risk with orders of magnitude more paranoia than things like ordinary air pollution that are far more deadly.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/bswud/status/1956004924493357181\">Ben Southwood</a>: The life expectancy of someone hit with 2,250 millisieverts of radiation in Hiroshima or Nagasaki was longer than the average Briton or American born in the same year. Today in Britain we spend billions controlling radiation levels more than 100,000 times smaller than this.</p>\n<p>2,250 millisieverts is a lot of radiation, like getting 225 full-body CT scans in one go. I don&#8217;t think anyone would recommend it. But it shows how ridiculous it is that we spend so much time, effort, and money on radiation levels of 1msv or 0.1 msv per year.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/AndrewHammel1/status/1957018808272515560\">Andrew Hammel reports that the Germans are finally on the verge</a> of losing their War on Air Conditioning, as in allowing ordinary people to buy one, because normies actually experienced air conditioning and are not idiots. The standard \u2018urban haute bourgeoisie\u2019 are holding out on principle, because they think life is about atoning for our sins and because they associate things like air conditioning with wasteful Americans. As you would expect, the alternative \u2018solutions\u2019 to heat wind up being exponentially more expensive than using AC.</p>\n<p>I do note that they have a point on this one:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Andrew Hammel: First of all, *every one* of these people has a story about visiting the USA and nearly freezing to death in an over air-conditioned store or office. Every. Damn. One. I can predict exactly when they will wheel out this traumatic tale, I just let it unfold naturally.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I mean, I have that too, to the point that it is a serious problem. This happens constantly in Florida. Even in New York\u2019s hotter summer days, I have the problem that there is nothing I can wear outside while walking to the restaurant, that I also want to be wearing once I sit down at the restaurant.

It is not a perfect program, but this is vastly better than what so many children end up watching. I echo that it would be even better if we included classic episodes as well.</p>\n<p>Indeed, we should be putting all the old PBS kids shows on YouTube, and everything else that it would be good for kids to be watching on the margin. The cost is low, the benefits are high. There are low quality versions of the shows of my extreme youth available (such as Letter People and Square One TV) but ancient-VHS quality is a dealbreaker for actually getting kids to watch.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019re The Worst</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/TheCinesthetic/status/1955789215783878811\">What TV show had the worst ending</a>? There are lots of great answers but the consensus is (in my opinion correctly) Game of Thrones at #1 and Lost at #2.</p>\n<p>After that it gets more fractured, and the other frequent picks here I am in position to evaluate were mostly bad endings (HIMYM, Killing Eve, Enterprise, Battlestar Galactica) but not competitive for the top spot. Dexter came up a lot but I never watched. Supernatural came up a bunch, and I\u2019m currently early in its final and 15th season and is it weird this makes me want to get to the end more not less? Better a truly awful end than a whimper?</p>\n<p>To be the true worst ending, it has to not only be awful but take what could have been true greatness and actively ruin the previous experience. You need to be in the running for Tier 1 and then blow it so badly you have to think about whether it even stays in Tier 2 because they poisoned everything. That\u2019s why Game of Thrones and Lost have to be so high.</p>\n<p>Indeed those two are so bad that they substantially hurt our willingness to invest in similar other shows, especially Lost-likes, which is enforcing the good discipline of forcing for example Severance to assure us they have everything mapped out.</p>\n<p>(Briefly on the others: While at the time I thought HIMYM\u2019s ending was as bad as everyone thinks, on reflection it has grown on me and I think it is actually fine, maybe even correct. Killing Eve\u2019s ending wasn\u2019t good exactly, but I didn\u2019t feel it ruined anything, it was more that all of season 4 was a substantial decline in quality. Battlestar Galactica was rage inducing but I understand why they did what they did and that mostly made it okay, again mostly the show started fantastic and was dropping off in quality generally. Enterprise ended bad, but again not historically bad, whereas the show wasn\u2019t getting bad, and mostly the frustration was we weren\u2019t done.</p>\n<p>I heard the claim recently that Lost\u2019s ending is aging well, as it suffered from the writers assuring us that they wouldn\u2019t do the thing they did, whereas now looking back no one much cares. There\u2019s that, but I still find it unsatisfying, they said they wouldn\u2019t do it that way for a reason, and the worse offense was the total failure to tie up loose ends and answer questions.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Golden Age of Cinema</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scottsumner.substack.com/p/peak-cinema?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=2934833&amp;post_id=167961768&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=3o9&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email\">Scott Sumner claims the greatest age of cinema was 1958-1963</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://scottsumner.substack.com/p/peak-cinema/comment/146047596\">Scott Sumner</a>: The public prefers 1980-2015, as you say. The movie experts say the 1920s-1970s were the best.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This highlighted the ways in which our preferences strongly diverge.</p>\n<p>Another big hint is that Sumner and the experts claim an extremely high correlation of director with quality of movie. Great directors are great, but so many other things matter too.</p>\n<p>As an example, recently <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/thezvi/film/mulholland-drive/\">I watched Mulholland Drive</a> for the first time, which Sumner says might be his favorite film. I appreciated many aspects of it, and ended up giving it 4/5 stars because it was in many senses \u2018objectively\u2019 excellent, but I did not actually enjoy the experience, and had to read an explainer afterwards from Film Colossus to make sense of a lot of it, and even after understanding it a lot of what it was trying to do and say left me cold, so I didn\u2019t feel I could say I \u2018liked\u2019 it.</p>\n<p>From what I can tell, the public is right and the \u2018experts\u2019 are wrong. Also I strongly suspect that We\u2019re So Back after a pause of timidity and sequilitius and superheroes.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Scott Sumner: There are two films that should never, ever be watched on TV. One is 2001 and the other is Lawrence of Arabia. If you saw them on anything other than a very big movie theatre screen, then you\u2019ve never actually seen them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I haven\u2019t seen 2001 regardless, but on Lawrence of Arabia I can\u2019t argue, because I attempted to watch it on a TV, and this indeed did not result in me seeing Lawrence of Arabia, because after half an hour I was absolutely bored to tears and could not make myself continue. There was a scene in which they literally just stood there in the sand for about a minute with actual nothing happening and I get what they were trying to do with that but it was one thing after another and I couldn\u2019t even, I was out.</p>\n<p>What I am confused by is how it would have improved things to make the screen bigger, unless it would be so one would feel forced to continue watching?</p>\n<p>Here are his 13 suggestions for films to watch, although I have no idea how one would watch Lawrence of Arabia given it has to be on a big screen?</p>\n<blockquote><p>Vertigo, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Touch of Evil, Some Like It Hot, Breathless, Jules and Jim, Last Year in Marienbad, High and Low, The End of Summer, 8 1/2, L\u2019Avventura, The Music Room, Lawrence of Arabia.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I tried to watch High and Low, and got an hour in but increasingly had the same sense I got from The Seven Samurai, which is \u2018this is in some objective senses a great movie and I get that but I have to force myself to keep watching it as outside of moment-to-moment it is not holding my interest\u2019 except with more idiot plot &#8211; and yes I realize some of that is cultural differences and noticing them is the most interesting thing so far but I\u2019m going to stick with idiot plot anyway. In addition to the idiot aspects, it really bothers me that \u2018pay or pretend to pay the ransom\u2019 is considered the obviously moral action. It isn\u2019t, that is terrible decision theory. The moral action is to say no, yet there is not even a moment\u2019s consideration of this question by anyone.</p>\n<p>If the above paragraph is still there when you read this, it means I was unable to motivate myself to keep watching.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Not What We Are Looking For</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/08/27/ne-zha-2-box-office-chinese-mythology/\">Jeff Yang explains some of the reasons Chinese movies tend to bomb in America</a>, in particular the global hit Ne Zha 2. Big Chinese movies tend to be based on super complex Chinese traditional epic stories that Chinese audiences already know whereas Americans haven\u2019t even seen Ne Zha 1. American stories have clear structure, understandable plots, payoffs for their events, central characters, and a moral vision that believes in progress or that things can be better. And they try to be comprehensible and to maintain a tonal theme and target market. Chinese movies, Yang reports, don\u2019t do any of that. Effectively, they assume the audience already knows the story, which is the only way they could possibly follow it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s as if Marvel movies were the big hits, and they didn\u2019t try to be comprehensible to anyone who didn\u2019t already know the characters and comics extensively? Certainly there are some advantages. It might be cool to see the \u2018advanced\u2019 directors cuts where it was assumed everyone had already either read the comics extensively or watched the normal version of the film?</p>\n<p>As Jeff says, if they can make money in China, then sure, why not do all this stuff that the Chinese audiences like even if it alienates us Westerners. There are enough movies for everyone. It does still feel like we\u2019re mostly right about this?</p>\n<p>Like everyone else I think Hollywood movies are too formulaic and similar, and too constrained by various rules, and thus too predictable, but those rules exist for a reason. When older movies or foreign movies break those rules, or decide they are not in any kind of hurry whatsoever, it comes at a cost. I don\u2019t think critics respect those costs enough.</p>\n<p>I strongly agree with Alea here and I am one of the ones who want to stay away:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/noncanonicAleae/status/1960488229531984112\">Alea</a>: Novels with an empty mystery box should be explicitly tagged so I can avoid them. 110% of the joy of reading comes from uncovering all the deep lore and tying up every loose end.

The link goes to a review from Matthew Yglesias that I agree with, it does cool things with nonlinearity and the performances and cinematography are good except when you put it together in the second half the resulting actual plot, while consistent and straightforward, makes no sense.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/thezvi/film/weapons-2025/reviews/\">Zvi Mowshowitz reviews Weapons</a> while avoiding spoilers: When you&#8217;re in, writing or deciding to go to a horror movie, you make dumb decisions.

There might actually be a pretty great movie here in which the missing kids are a tragedy that never gets explained or solved because what matters is a different third act that focuses on how people react to it.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Know When To Fold Em</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://next.io/news/regulation/new-jersey-bill-seeks-ban-micro-bets/\">New Jersey looks to ban \u2018micro bets,\u2019 meaning sports bets about individual plays</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Erik Gibbs: The bill\u2019s language defines a micro bet as any live proposition bet placed during an event that pertains specifically to the outcome of the next discrete play or action.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This restriction seems clearly good.

Oh, and congratulations to both of them, of course.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/7e4oBEEy8shskcjJnpfThr?si=RoUVVmLgQzaYsIxLi-sZ0g&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=181395b9abb94c6d\">Sam Black has a new podcast about cEDH</a>.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t understand why <a href=\"https://x.com/bkowal23/status/1961900870448116075\">Wizards of the Coast continues to be so slow on the banhammer in situations like Cauldron</a>. We saw repeatedly exactly the broken format pattern, such as here where Cauldron starts out at 30% and then goes to 56% after six rounds, then a much larger majority of the top 8s. This continued long past the point where there was reasonable hope it would be fixed by innovation.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/LangeMason/status/1962544726260768986\">Mason Iange:</a> Doesn&#8217;t it make sense that in a rotating format like standard, wotc wants people to have confidence in buying product and building decks? Literally no one is going to play standard if the best decks just get banned every 2 month.</p>\n<p>Saffron Olive: The way I see is it there are two paths: you design cards conservatively and don&#8217;t need to ban anything, or you design cards aggressively and need to ban cards fairly often. Wizards is trying to design cards aggressively and never ban anything, which I don&#8217;t think is actually possible.</p>\n<p>Patrick Sullivan: What you\u2019re saying is true/relevant, but there are other considerations; the current state of affairs would clearly not be tolerated absent the stuff you\u2019re mentioning. That\u2019s why I think they should allow themselves to be as agile as possible regardless of what they decide to do.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/bkowal23/status/1962576540828303451\">Brian Kowal</a>: The opposite of how I feel about rotating formats. I want it dynamic. I\u2019d rather they make a balanced format. With a rotating format I want to feel like I can innovate. If it is solved I quickly lose interest. There are many formats that never rotate to protect investment.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think \u2018mix it up every time it is solved\u2019 is going too far given how quickly we now solve formats, but the solution has to not be \u2018play this deck or else.\u2019 Yes, banning the best deck every two months would make you reluctant to invest in Standard, but effectively banning all but the best deck for months on end, or having to face an endless stream of the same overpowered nonsense even if you\u2019re willing to sacrifice win rate to go rogue, is even worse.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/standard-and-moving-ban-announcement\">They came out with an explanation and update on the 9th</a>. A big part of this is that they screwed up timing the ban windows, and have a crazy high bar for doing \u201cemergency\u201d bans versus bans on announcement days. They are mitigating this going forward by adding more windows next year, one every major set release.</p>\n<p>That points out how crazy the situation was. You\u2019re going to release a set, and then not have a ban opportunity until after releasing the next set? That\u2019s crazy.</p>\n<p>Based on past experiences, I believe Brian Kowal is correct that an extended period of a miserable format, with bans that everybody knows have to happen but are extensively delayed, creates a point of no return, where permanent damage to the format and the game begins to accumulate.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/bkowal23/status/1965960671046017403\">Brian Kowal</a>: There should be room in the ban policy for emergency bans. Perception has hit the point of no return. A significant portion of players do not want to touch Standard now. Rotation should be when we are creating players for the next year and this rotation lasts until January 2027! (I\u2019m 80% on this. Somebody let me know if I\u2019m wrong) Players are quitting Standard again to look for other games and formats. New players are choosing not to invest in it.</p>\n<p>When format perception hits this state everybody knows something is getting a ban. So a lot of die hard competitives are even taking a break rather than buying 4 copies of the two most expensive cards in Standard.</p>\n<p>The best way to go imo is to just suck it up and ban Cauldron immediately. Again, we all know it is happening anyway. Not taking action over and over again and just letting everybody suffer months of a bad format makes WOTC look like they don\u2019t care.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/LizardJenny/status/1965480611281600917\">Jenny</a>: WotC took HOW long to decide to do nothing and ruin another Spotlight Series and RCQ season? Using the Arena ladder meta to judge the health of the format is *insane*</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/Jenn_the_Judge/status/1965820187585949838\">Pactdoll Terror</a>: My 2-slot RCQ this Saturday in NYC sold 8 spots. I usually do 50. Someone who built Vivi to grind RCQs would be annoyed that it got banned, but Standard is DEAD locally. Weeklies aren&#8217;t launching, RCQs struggle to make money. Holding bans is bad for everyone except Vivi players.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Instead they\u2019re going to do a strange compromise, and move up their next announcement date from November 24 to November 10, which still leaves two full months of this.</p>\n<p>We should never have more than a month \u2018in limbo\u2019 where things are miserable and we know what is coming. Even if you decide to keep playing you are in an impossible position.</p>\n<p>They say \u2018Standard has not yet reached its final form\u2019 but they are grasping at straws.</p>\n<p>They say the Arena ladder is looking less awful. The Arena ladder is not real life, not only because the play level is low but also there\u2019s nothing forcing the players to play the best deck. I learned that the hard way during the Oko era.</p>\n<p>I get Carmen\u2019s argument here that we ran the experiment and when you don\u2019t have ban windows, you get constant speculation about potential bans and a lot of uncertainty, And That\u2019s Terrible. You can\u2019t fully embrace The Unexpected Banning. There needs to be a substantially higher bar outside of a fixed set of days.</p>\n<p>The current situation was still ludicrous. While insufficiently competitive play is not as lopsided, that\u2019s largely about card access and players wanting to have fun and of course not wanting to do this into a future ban. This ban would not be \u2018from under players in a surprise move\u2019 even if no formal warning was given. The idea that \u2018we won\u2019t make a move based on competitive play, only on non-competitive play, you competitors don\u2019t much matter\u2019 is definitely giving me even less desire to come back.</p>\n<p>Which of course I get. Magic is not made for me. I\u2019m just deeply sad about it.</p>\n<p>I see the argument this isn\u2019t a pure \u2018do it today or else\u2019 situation but it is an emergency. If I was Wizards, the moment it was clear we probably had a problem I would have created a new announcement date much closer in the future than two months, with the clear statement that at that time they would choose whether to ban Vivi, Caldron, both or neither. And then done it by now.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/SamuelHBlack/status/1957268152930156600\">Pro Tour levels of cEDH (competitive commander) are an awesome thing to have exist, but seem to have a rather severe draw problem</a>, because everyone knows how to play politics and how to force draws. Sam Black suggests making draws zero points, which I worry could create even more intense politics and feel bad moments but <a href=\"https://x.com/CalebDragonborn/status/1957272707625558079\">when 1-0-6 is a \u2018great record\u2019</a> then maybe it is time and it seems like the elimination rounds work fine?</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sam Black: The house games are more fun when we don\u2019t play for draws. Similarly games in top 16 are more fun.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ultimately, I don\u2019t think any solution would satisfy me, since it is going to come down to pure politics and kingmaker decisions. One potential approach is to say that wins are 10, draws are 1, and we pair people accordingly, so taking the draw is not obviously good for you, it might be wiser to lose and get paired against others who aren\u2019t playing for draws. In the 0-0-4 bracket I don\u2019t like your winning chances, and you have to win at some point to make the cut.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/SamuelHBlack/status/1963254095168278879\">Sam Black talks about the role of</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/S7uFdYrVHs\">mediocre synergistic cards</a>. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=Ut3n8GdvkIM&amp;ab_channel=DanaFischerMTG\">You start with strong cards, and pick up the bad cards that work for you for free at the end</a>. If the bad cards vanish, the lane is not open, go a different way. Only prioritize cards that have a high ceiling, and (almost) never take a consistently bad card in your colors that can\u2019t make your deck much better when a pack contains a good card. Similarly, trying to read signals explicitly is overrated relative to taking good cards, which is underrated and serves the same purpose.</p>\n<p>The exception (he seems to assumes in the modern era this won\u2019t ever happen, which seems wrong to me) is if you are in danger of not having a deck, because you lack either enough cards or a key component, such that taking a usually bad card actually does provide substantial improvement.</p>\n<p>Some cards that look bad, and have bad win rates, are instead good in the sense that they have high upside, but are being used badly by people who use them without the upside case. Sam\u2019s example is a card that defaults to being a bad Divination but enables never running out of cards, so you can build your entire strategy around this, but if you put in your deck as a bad Divination then it will be bad.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I Was Promised Flying Self-Driving Cars</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Waymo employees are doing rider-only mode on freeways in San Francisco (including US 101), Phoenix and Los Angeles.

Cook was not about to leave quietly.</p>\n<p>Initial market reaction was muted, the dollar only declined 0.3% and gold only rose 0.6%, likely because it was one escalation among many and it might fail, but this is a direct full assault on central bank independence, and central bank independence is a really big deal.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Jonnelle Marte and Myles Miller (Bloomberg): While a president has never removed a Fed governor from office, one can do so for cause.

There are no additional claims. Only the claim that she claimed one place would be a primary residence, and then claimed a different primary residence.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Pulte, in a statement posted to social media, thanked Trump for removing Cook. \u201cIf you commit mortgage fraud in America, we will come after you, no matter who you are,\u201d he wrote.</p></blockquote>\n<p>What about if you are President of the United States and have recently had a nine figure judgment against your \u2018Trump\u2019 organization entered against you for lying on mortgage applications? Are we coming for you?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/Fritschner/status/1966619302880034821\">Oh, and what if it turned out,</a> as it has, that the claim against Cook simply isn\u2019t true?</p>\n<blockquote><p>Aaron Fritschner: The mortgage fraud claim against Lisa Cook is false, per documents obtained by Reuters. Bill Pulte&#8217;s accusation, the sole pretext Trump used to fire her from the Fed, was that she claimed two homes as primary residence. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fed-governor-cook-declared-her-atlanta-property-vacation-home-documents-show-2025-09-13/\">These docs show she did not</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe document, dated May 28, 2021, was issued to Cook by her credit union in the weeks before she completed the purchase and shows that she had told the lender that the Atlanta property wouldn\u2019t be her primary residence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cdocumentation reviewed by Reuters for the Atlanta home filed with a court in Georgia\u2019s Fulton County, clearly says the stipulation exists \u201cunless Lender otherwise agrees in writing.\u201d The loan estimate, a document prepared by the credit union, states \u201cProperty Use: Vacation Home\u201d</p>\n<p>Lisa Cook also didn\u2019t claim a tax credit for primary residence on the second home and declared it as a second home on official federal government documents when she was being considered for a role on the Fed. A real master criminal.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Also her mortgage rate was 3.5%, modestly higher than the going rate at the time.</p>\n<p>If you are going to try and fire a Federal Reserve President for cause, something that has not happened (checks notes, by which I mean GPT-5) ever, thus endangering faith in Fed independence and the entire financial system, you might want to follow due process, or at least confirm that your accusation is true? As opposed to demonstrably false?</p>\n<p>A lot of people are understandably highly outraged about this, <a href=\"https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-406-trump-v-the-fed-or?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=h8n&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">as Adam Tooze partly covered</a> right after the attempted firing.

We teach people they have to lie in order to get food stamps, and they (just like LLMs!) learn to generalize this, everything impacts everything, our society is saying lying is okay and lying to the government is mandatory, you can\u2019t isolate that. You don\u2019t get a high trust society that way, although we are remarkably high trust in some ways despite this.</p>\n<p>Most of the time, the correct answer is not to enforce the rules as written even if we could do so, instead the correct answer is to remove or heavily modify the rule. Our rules are tuned to the idea they won\u2019t be enforced, so it is likely enforcing them would not go well. Then there are exceptions, such as primary residence mortgage fraud.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Aaron Bergman: I think ethics- and integrity-pilled people need to have a better theory of when it\u2019s cool to lie to *institutions*</p>\n<p>The \u201clying to a human\u201d vs \u201clying to institution\u201d distinction is real and important btw, the bar for the latter is much lower</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ohabryka/status/1963308358175457385\">Oliver Habryka</a>: Yeah, I agree with this.

My guess is it is roughly \u2018do not break the social contract.\u2019 But if this is something where is no longer (or never was) a social contract, and no one would look at you funny if you were doing it in the open, then fine.</p>\n<p>If you notice you are very clearly expected to lie (including by omission) or do a fake version of something, that the system is designed that way, then you have little choice, especially if you are also forced to deal with such institutions in order to get vital goods or services.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ByMikeBaker/status/1962890986528571818\">Idaho suicide hotline is forced to ask teens who call to get parental consent</a> <a href=\"https://idahocapitalsun.com/2025/08/29/idahos-parental-consent-law-impedes-988-suicide-crisis-hotline-access-for-some-youth/\">due to a law passed last year</a> requiring consent for almost all medical treatments for minors.

This continues the pattern where:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Meta has a safety problem.</li>\n<li>When Meta tries to have internal clarity and do research on the dangers of its products, people leak that information to the press, details get taken out of context and they get hauled before Congress.</li>\n<li>When Meta responds to this by avoiding clarity, and suppressing the research or ignoring the problem, they get blamed for that too.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I mean, yes, why not simply actually deal with your safety problems is a valid response, but the incentives here are pretty nasty.</p>\n<p>The central accusation is that the company\u2019s lawyers intervened to shape research into risks from virtual reality, but I mean it would be insane for Meta not to loop the lawyers in on that research. If we are going to make Meta blameworthy, including legally, for doing the research, then yes they are going to run the research by the lawyers.

I\u2019m not saying you don\u2019t need to have safeguards for this, but it all sounds very similar to the paranoia and statistical illiteracy where we don\u2019t let children participate in physical spaces anymore.</p>\n<p>I love this report of a major problem running the other way, to which, I mean, fair:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In a January 2022 post to a private internal message board, a Meta employee flagged the presence of children in \u201cHorizon Worlds,\u201d which was at the time supposed to be used only by adults 18 and over. The employee wrote that an analysis of app reviews indicated many were being driven off the app because of child users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019m not saying Meta handled any of this perfectly or even handled it well.

Journalists have their problems too but they have much better bullshit detectors, for instance.</p>\n<p>The most important research paper of the past 10 years is the Google transformer paper (&#8220;Attention Is All You Need&#8221;) and it was written by non-academics and published in an open-access journal.</p>\n<p>You ran some cool regression analysis OK great. Make some nice graphics and put it on a Substack. Engaging headline, 1500-2500 well-written words.

Not inserting new stuff, but leaving fairly-obvious but not super important work undone as \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d for the reviewers to notice and ask for.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This suggests a wager.</p>\n<p>Select a field. A neutral party (or an LLM with an agreed upon prompt) selects 10 recent papers that meet some criteria for being Proper Papers In Good Journals and that assert some statistical finding and thus could in theory be flawed.</p>\n<p>If Nate Silver can find a fatal flaw in at least 2 of the 10 papers, as evaluated by an agreed neutral judge, then he wins. If not, he loses. This should cover both sides: Two is enough that the system is obviously fatally flawed, and Nate says he can average five.</p>\n<p>This is not a statement that the first best solution to peer review involved outsiders like Nate Silver reviewing papers.

It is a claim that the current solution is so utterly terrible that outsider review would be a big improvement.</p>\n<p>Indeed, \u2018put your ideas out on the internet and let people critique them\u2019 is the actual essence of true peer review, and far superior in practice to the formal version in 2025.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/analyzing-a-critique-of-the-ai-2027?utm_source=publication-search\">I am reminded of when I wrote a detailed response to a detailed response to AI 2027.</a> Titotal accused AI 2027 of not having gone through \u2018peer review\u2019 and then proceeded to do peer review of AI 2027.

That doesn\u2019t mean we know how to pull it off. As he notes, prediction markets have been somewhat helpful, but seem unlikely to be the full game changer we need. Also as he notes, this would be great to pull off but there\u2019s an attractor that causes this to look more relatively doable than it is, which can trick people into focusing on it more than they should relative to other interventions.</p>\n<p>Kelsey Piper provides her overview of the findings that <a href=\"https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/giving-people-money-helped-less-than\">Giving People Money on a monthly basis in America does not seem to improve most outcomes</a>, including child outcomes. They\u2019re not \u2018blowing\u2019 the money on vices, but people give back a lot of it by working less, and while they tell stories about how great things are, most of the statistics don\u2019t improve.</p>\n<p>She then points us to a <a href=\"https://thecausalfallacy.com/p/rossis-revenge\">conservative critique of her analysis by Charles Lehman</a>. I agree with Charles that the criticism \u2018maybe the gains don\u2019t show up in the measurements\u2019 is rather silly, unless you can point to a specific policy aim that isn\u2019t being measured, and explain why you have hope for that one despite the others not showing up.</p>\n<p>I also appreciated Charles saying that for American purposes, a study of a social intervention in Africa should be treated similarly to when biologists say something \u2018works in vitro,\u2019 as conditions are so radically different. The synthesis would be that \u2018give people money\u2019 is highly useful at improving various outcomes when those people have so little money that they risk starvation, but not that far beyond that, and existing interventions here already take us above the threshold.</p>\n<p>We definitely need to reconcile our model of how this works with not only the null results in these studies, but also the other null results from many other programs.</p>\n<p>One reason to be suspicious of \u2018policy mostly can\u2019t help\u2019 is that if you propose \u2018policy mostly can\u2019t hurt\u2019 or even \u2018getting rid of existing policies and enforcement mostly can\u2019t hurt\u2019 then most people will disagree with you. So at minimum, you can help by not hurting, and you should find the extreme asymmetry suspicious.</p>\n<p>I do have one policy objective that I am confident this does help with if it is reliable and sustained, which is fertility. I\u2019m sticking by the estimate that for every ~$270k in value (which need not be cash) you transfer to parents, you get one additional birth. This is one area where anticipation of money, or rather anticipation of having the necessary resources of all types, definitely changes behavior.</p>\n<p>I concur with the consensus view that <a href=\"https://substack.com/@honestsignals/p-168898025\">this post from Lennox about trying to sell Marx to EAs backfiring spectacularly</a> is a gem of a read. You get such fun as Lennox encountering the Socialist Calculation Debate in its purest form:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Lennox: But when I looked at what the EAs were actually doing, and the methods they were using to evaluate charities, it quickly became clear that this was not going to work. One look at a GiveWell spreadsheet filled my heart with dread. They were creating insanely detailed cost effectiveness estimates of different interventions, using probabilistic models that tried to account for every possible empirical and philosophical assumption you could think of.</p>\n<p>It would be great to analyse policies that fundamentally transform the economy at this level of detail, but there were a couple of problems. First, it&#8217;s impossible to create a useful model at that level of detail for transformative economic policies. Second, even if it were possible, there&#8217;s no way I could do it.</p>\n<p>Fine. Lesson learned.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Except, of course, lesson not learned, because he didn\u2019t then think \u2018oh that is exactly why the socialist ideas I am advocating for won\u2019t work.\u2019 So he continues, and asks his sociological experts who love socialism.

Here was a group of serious academics who had spent decades trying to make a rigorous case for socialism, and this is what they ended up concluding? That we don&#8217;t have the social technology to make it work, but maybe one day we will get there.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He then does the \u2018finds smoking causes cancer, quits reading\u2019 move, saying this means analytical Marxists had undermined themselves so maybe look at critical theory. Because, of course:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d assumed that if you want to solve a systemic problem like global poverty, you need to understand the root cause, and the root cause of poverty was, of course, capitalism.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>However, understanding the root cause of something doesn&#8217;t automatically help you solve it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The main mistake, of course, is that the root cause was not capitalism but instead the human condition. This had not yet entered Lennox\u2019s hypothesis space. The other mistake was, yes, knowing the root cause of something does not always help solve it.</p>\n<p>The evidence continued to mount.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Throughout undergrad, I would read sociological theorists and often find their arguments vague, opaque, and at times just poorly argued. Then I would read work by EAs and find it crystal clear, carefully argued, and generally well calibrated to the evidence.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>The final nail in the coffin came while reading Scott Alexander&#8217;s essay<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\"> <em>Meditations on Moloch</em></a>.</p>\n<p>..</p>\n<p>Looking back, I could have saved myself a lot of time. These fundamental problems with the project were probably obvious to many in the EA community and they would have told me the project was unlikely to be useful, if I&#8217;d had the courage to ask. But I avoided getting their feedback, partly because I figured they were ideologically blinded and would just dismiss anything critical of their movement.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That last line really is wonderful. Socialist refuses to get feedback from target audience because they are worried audience is ideologically blinded. Love it.</p>\n<p>After that he is then able to do some self-reflection, also fun but less fun. Then in conclusion he comes around and notes that if you accept that the world is a swirling mess of misaligned incentives and coordination problems, then this completely undermines the Marxist political project.</p>\n<p>That is indeed how the world works, so yes. Thank you. Well done, sir. Also, well done, sir, at the end:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Anyway, a couple of years after this happened I fell in love, and it was everything the poets and songwriters said it would be. So I guess the moral of the story is: if you find yourself tempted to construct elaborate ideological arguments in a vain attempt to make yourself feel smart and important, consider falling in love instead.</p></blockquote>"
