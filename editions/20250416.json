            "summary": "<p><em>Short one this time because I have a lot going on this week.</em></p> <p>In computation complexity, <strong>NP</strong> is the class of all decision problems (yes/no) where a potential proof (or \"witness\") for \"yes\" can be <em>verified</em> in polynomial time. For example, \"does this set of numbers have a subset that sums to zero\" is in NP. If the answer is \"yes\", you can prove it by presenting a set of numbers. We would then verify the witness by 1) checking that all the numbers are present in the set (~linear time) and 2) adding up all the numbers (also linear). </p> <p><strong>NP-complete</strong> is the class of \"hardest possible\" NP problems. Subset sum is NP-complete. <strong>NP-hard</strong> is the set all problems <em>at least as hard</em> as NP-complete. Notably, NP-hard is <em>not</em> a subset of NP, as it contains problems that are <em>harder</em> than NP-complete. A natural question to ask is \"like what?\" And the canonical example of \"NP-harder\" is the halting problem (HALT): does program P halt on input C? As the argument goes, it's undecidable, so obviously not in NP.</p> <p>I think this is a bad example for two reasons:</p> <ol> <li>All NP requires is that witnesses for \"yes\" can",
