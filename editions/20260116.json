</dl>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I\u2019m pretty happy with this list, and with the amount of variety and wordplay I managed to fit into a dozen titles.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"top-pun-choosing-the-movie-titles\">Top Pun: choosing the movie titles</h2>\n\n<p>The trick to writing good puns is to write lots of puns, then throw away the bad ones.\nI\u00a0only needed a dozen movies, but I had over thirty other titles that I didn\u2019t use.</p>\n\n<p>If the puns aren\u2019t coming immediately, I write two lists: the phrases or words I want to parody, and the words I\u2019m trying to shoehorn in.\nIn this case, the first list had phrases like <em>X-Men</em> or <em>Mission Impossible</em>, and the second had words like <em>pixel</em>, <em>margin</em>, and <em>flex</em>.</p>\n\n<p>This is where I reach for search engines \u2013 I won\u2019t find anybody else making the exact puns I want, but I can find pre-existing lists of these building blocks.\nIn this case, I looked at lists of famous and iconic films, and I read web development tutorials and glossaries.\nI\u00a0leant toward popular films so more people would get the reference; a pun on an obscure film would likely be missed.</p>\n\n<p>As I build the two lists, I start to spot connections, like the fact that <em>X-Men</em> could become <em>Flex-Men</em>.\nI\u00a0write down all my ideas, even the bad ones \u2013 often a bad idea is the jumping off point for a good one.\nFor example, an early idea was <em>Block to the Future</em>, which isn\u2019t very good, but later I realised I could use <em>Back</em>/<em>Block</em> for <em>The Empire Strikes Block</em> instead, which is much better.</p>\n\n<p>If this was a purely text-based exercise, the titles would be enough \u2013 but I also needed posters.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"blurhemian-rhapsody-making-the-posters-with-primitive\">Blurhemian Rhapsody: making the posters with Primitive</h2>\n\n<p>I needed some posters to go with the titles, but what to use?</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to use the movie posters because many films have iconic posters, and that would help people recognise the pun \u2013 but I didn\u2019t want to use the real movie posters, because they often show the title.\nThat would contradict my text, not help it.</p>\n\n<p>But I do have an image editor, and while I lack the Photoshop skills to replace the title in a convincing way, I can make text that looks okay if you squint \u2013 and that gave me an idea.</p>\n\n<p>Several years ago, I used Michael Fogleman\u2019s <a href=\"https://github.com/fogleman/primitive\">Primitive tool</a> to create some wallpapers.\nPrimitive redraws images with a simple geometric shapes, adding one shape at a time, trying to get closer and closer to the original image.</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an example, in which my face has been redrawn as several hundred triangles:</p>\n\n<figure>\n\n\n<source type=\"image/avif\" /><source type=\"image/webp\" /><source type=\"image/jpeg\" /><img alt=\"A selfie. I'm wearing glasses, have dark brown hair falling down one side of my face, I'm smiling at the camera, I'm wearing a green dress, and sitting in front of some plants and greenery.\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2026/profile_original_1x.jpg\" width=\"300\" />\n\n\n\n\n<source type=\"image/avif\" /><source type=\"image/webp\" /><source type=\"image/png\" /><img alt=\"The same picture, but now redrawn in coloured triangles. There's a resemblance to the original image, but the detailed elements like the plant leaves or strands of hair have been blurred out.\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2026/profile_primitive_1x.png\" width=\"300\" />\n\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>This gives a recognisable version of the image, but it\u2019s a distinct style and you won\u2019t mistake it for the real thing.</p>\n\n<p>For each movie I was considering, I downloaded a poster from <a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/\">The Movie Databaase</a>, and I used Primitive to blur it.\nSometimes the original title would appear through the blur, in which case I used an image editor to replace the title and re-blurred it.\nThe blurring meant I could get away with a rough edit \u2013 for example, I didn\u2019t need the exact font \u2013 because any imperfections would be blurred away by Primitive.</p>\n\n<p>This added a new dimension to my search for puns \u2013 I wanted movie posters that would still be recognisable after this blurring.\nThis ruled out posters that are very busy, because it\u2019s difficult to distinguish individual elements after the blurring.\nI\u00a0looked at lists of iconic movie posters, which often have clear, distinct shapes that hold up well when converted into triangles.</p>\n\n<p>One of the best examples of an iconic poster is <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em>.\nI\u00a0know nothing about the film, but I remember the poster with the big red heel.\nWhen you blur the poster with Primitive, it becomes recognisable almost immediately.\nThis is what it looks like with 5, 25, and 50 triangles:</p>\n\n<figure>\n  \n\n<source type=\"image/avif\" /><source type=\"image/webp\" /><source type=\"image/jpeg\" /><img alt=\"The original poster, which shows a glossy red high-heeled shoe. The point of the heel has been replaced with a trident that looks like a three-pronged devil's tail.\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2026/devil-wears-prada_1x.jpg\" width=\"200\" />\n\n\n  \n\n<source type=\"image/avif\" /><source type=\"image/webp\" /><source type=\"image/png\" /><img alt=\"The blurred poster with 5 triangles. A\u00a0maroon red triangular shape is discernible on the left-hand side, which is recognisable if you compare it to the original, but doesn't stand out on its own.\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2026/devil-wears-prada-5_1x.png\" width=\"200\" />\n\n\n  \n\n<source type=\"image/avif\" /><source type=\"image/webp\" /><source type=\"image/png\" /><img alt=\"The blurred poster with 10 triangles. The shape of the shoe is now clearly visible, and the heel is starting to resolve.\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2026/devil-wears-prada-25_1x.png\" width=\"200\" />\n\n\n  \n\n<source type=\"image/avif\" /><source type=\"image/webp\" /><source type=\"image/png\" /><img alt=\"The blurred poster with 10 triangles. The shape of the shoe is now clear, the shades match the gloss colouring, and the three points of the trident are also appearing.\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2026/devil-wears-prada-50_1x.png\" width=\"200\" />\n\n\n</figure>\n\n<p>I had a year where all my desktop wallpapers were photos that I\u2019d blurred using Primitive, and I\u2019ve been waiting for a chance to use it in a bigger project.\nI\u2019m really pleased with the result \u2013 it lets me lean into the titles I\u2019ve created, and it gives the whole collection a coherent appearance.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"widening-the-lens-choosing-a-more-diverse-selection\">Widening the Lens: choosing a more diverse selection</h2>\n\n<p>I picked a dozen movies and started writing the article.\nBut as I was taking screenshots of the movie grid, I noticed that my initial selection wasn\u2019t very representative.\nTen of the twelve films had all-or-mostly men in the main roles, and all of the lead characters were white.</p>\n\n<p>I was tempted to ignore this problem, because this is just a fake collection for a blog post and does it really matter?\nBut that was disingenuous \u2013 I cared enough to put in all this effort, so it must be a meaningful selection to me.\nI\u00a0wanted a more diverse and interesting selection.</p>\n\n<p>I looked for lists of famous movies which centre women and non-white characters, and added several to my made-up collection.\nIdeally I\u2019d also have some movies that centre queer or disabled characters, but I couldn\u2019t find any with an iconic poster or a pun-worthy title.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"blooper-reel-the-movies-i-didnt-use\">Blooper Reel: the movies I didn\u2019t use</h2>\n\n<p>I made a lot of puns and posters, including a couple of personal favourites that I cut from the post:</p>\n\n<figure>\n  \n\n<source type=\"image/avif\" /><source type=\"image/webp\" /><source type=\"image/png\" /><img alt=\"A blurred poster for \u2018Fifty Shades of #999\u2019.

The letters \u2018#999\u2019 are especially prominent.\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2026/fifty-shades-of-999_1x.png\" width=\"250\" />\n\n\n  \n\n<source type=\"image/avif\" /><source type=\"image/webp\" /><source type=\"image/png\" /><img alt=\"A blurred poster for \u2018X-Men\u2019. It\u2019s a bright and colourful image with lots of superheroes, not enough detail to discern any of them clearly. The title \u2018X-Men\u2019 is clearly visible in bold colours at the top of the poster.\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2026/flex-men_1x.png\" width=\"250\" />\n\n\n  \n\n<source type=\"image/avif\" /><source type=\"image/webp\" /><source type=\"image/png\" /><img alt=\"A blurred poster for \u2018Home Align\u2019. A\u00a0small child holds their hands up to their face, while two criminals look through a window behind them. The title of the movie is just about readable at the top of the poster.\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2026/home-align_1x.png\" width=\"250\" />\n\n\n</figure>\n\n<p><em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> became <em>Fifty Shades of #999</em> and was the first movie where I considered replacing a colour with a hex code.\nI\u00a0swapped this out for <em>The Colour Purple</em> when I was trying to create a more diverse list, and replacing a mostly-grey poster with a pop of colour helped too.</p>\n\n<p><em>X-Men</em> became <em>Flex-men</em>, and I\u2019m really sad I couldn\u2019t use that pun.\nThis was let down by the poster \u2013 the original X-Men branding is very prominent and would be hard to change, and all of the colourful X-Men posters are very busy with lots of characters.</p>\n\n<p><em>Home Alone</em> became <em>Home Align</em>, which is a weaker pun but another easily-recognisable poster.</p>\n\n<p>I had good reasons to cut all of them, and the selection is better off without them \u2013 but maybe they\u2019ll reappear in a future post.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-would-you-do-this\">Why would you do this?</h2>\n\n<p>This is a lot of effort for placeholder data in a single blog post.\nI\u00a0did it because it was fun, and it helped me enjoy writing the rest of the post.\nEvery time I thought of another title or saw a poster in a screenshot, it made me smile.\nThat\u2019s enough of a reason.</p>\n\n<p>This sort of fun detail is why I like having a personal blog which isn\u2019t a business or an income stream.\nI\u00a0write because I enjoy it, and I can make decisions that don\u2019t make commercial sense because it\u2019s not a commercial website.\nThis side quest had terrible return on investment if you only care about time and money \u2013 but it was fantastic for joy.</p>\n\n\n    <p>[If the formatting of this post looks odd in your feed reader, <a href=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2026/parody-movie-posters/?ref=rss\">visit the original article</a>]</p>"

                "<p>Thanks to everyone who sent in condolences on my recent death from prostate cancer at age 68, but that was Scott Adams. I (Scott Alexander) am still alive<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-1\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a>. </p><p>Still, the condolences are appreciated. Scott Adams was a surprisingly big part of my life. I may be the only person to have read every <em>Dilbert </em>book before graduating elementary school<em>. </em>For some reason, 10-year-old-Scott found Adams&#8217; stories of time-wasting meetings and pointy-haired bosses hilarious. No doubt some of the attraction came from a more-than-passing resemblance between Dilbert&#8217;s nameless corporation and the California public school system. We&#8217;re all inmates in prisons with different names.</p><p>But it would be insufficiently ambitious to stop there. Adams&#8217; comics were about the nerd experience. About being cleverer than everyone else, not just in the sense of being high IQ, but in the sense of being the only sane man in a crazy world where everyone else spends their days listening to overpaid consultants drone on about mission statements instead of doing anything useful. There&#8217;s an arc in Dilbert where the boss disappears for a few weeks and the engineers get to manage their own time. Productivity shoots up. Morale soars. They invent warp drives and time machines. Then the boss returns, and they&#8217;re back to being chronically behind schedule and over budget. This is the nerd outlook in a nutshell: if <em>I</em> ran the circus, there&#8217;d be some changes around here.</p><p>Yet the other half of the nerd experience is: for some reason this never works. Dilbert and his brilliant co-workers are stuck watching from their cubicles while their idiot boss racks in bonuses and accolades. If humor, like religion, is an opiate of the masses, then Adams is masterfully unsubtle about what type of wound his art is trying to numb. </p><p>This is the basic engine of <em>Dilbert</em>: everyone is rewarded in exact inverse proportion to their virtue. Dilbert and Alice are brilliant and hard-working, so they get crumbs. Wally is brilliant but lazy, so he at least enjoys a fool&#8217;s paradise of endless coffee and donuts while his co-workers clean up his messes. The P.H.B. is neither smart nor industrious, so he is forever on top, reaping the rewards of everyone else&#8217;s toil. Dogbert, an inveterate scammer with a passing resemblance to various trickster deities, makes out best of all. </p><p>The repressed object at the bottom of the nerd subconscious, the thing too scary to view except through humor, is that you&#8217;re smarter than everyone else, but <em>for some reason it isn&#8217;t working</em>. Somehow all that stuff about small talk and sportsball and drinking makes them stronger than you. No equation can tell you why. Your best-laid plans turn to dust at a single glint of Chad&#8217;s perfectly-white teeth. </p><p>Lesser lights may distance themselves from their art, but Adams radiated contempt for such surrender. He lived his whole life as a series of Dilbert strips. Gather them into one of his signature compendia, and the title would be <em>Dilbert Achieves Self Awareness And Realizes That If He&#8217;s So Smart Then He Ought To Be Able To Become The Pointy-Haired Boss, Devotes His Whole Life To This Effort, Achieves About 50% Success, Ends Up In An Uncanny Valley Where He Has Neither The Virtues Of The Honest Engineer Nor Truly Those Of The Slick Consultant, Then Dies Of Cancer Right When His Character Arc Starts To Get Interesting.</em></p><p>If your reaction is &#8220;I would <em>absolutely</em> buy that book&#8221;, then keep reading, but expect some detours.</p><h2>Fugitive From The Cubicle Police</h2><p>The niche that became <em>Dilbert</em> opened when Garfield first said &#8220;I hate Mondays&#8221;. The quote became a popular sensation, inspiring <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=i+hate+mondays&amp;crid=3EPL7ZRK6BGPV&amp;sprefix=i+hate+mondays%2Caps%2C162\">t-shirts, coffee mugs</a>, and even <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Hate_Mondays_(song)\">a hit single</a>. But (as I&#8217;m hardly the first to point out) why should Garfield hate Mondays? He&#8217;s a cat!

You&#8217;d put a Dilbert comic on your cubicle wall, and feel like you&#8217;d gotten away with something. If you were really clever, you&#8217;d put the Dilbert comic where Dilbert gets in trouble for putting a comic on his cubicle wall on your cubicle wall, and dare them to move against you.</p><p>(again, I was ten at the time. I only know about this because Scott Adams would start each of his book collections with an essay, and sometimes he would talk about letters he got from fans, and many of them would have stories like these.)</p><p>But t-shirts saying &#8220;Working Hard . . . Or Hardly Working?&#8221; no longer hit as hard as they once did. Contra the usual story, Millennials are too <em>earnest</em> to tolerate the pleasant contradiction of saying they hate their job and then going in every day with a smile. They either have to genuinely hate their job - become some kind of dirtbag communist labor activist - or at least pretend to love it. The worm turns, all that is cringe becomes based once more and vice versa. Imagine that guy boasting to his date again. One says: &#8220;Oh yeah, I grudgingly clock in every day to give my eight hours to the rat race, but trust me, I&#8217;m secretly hating myself the whole time&#8221;? The other: &#8220;I work for a boutique solar energy startup that&#8217;s ending climate change - saving the environment is my passion!&#8221; Zoomers are worse still: not even the fig leaf of social good, just pure hustle.</p><p>Silicon Valley, where hustle culture has reached its apogee, has an additional consideration: why don&#8217;t you found a startup? If you&#8217;re so much smarter than your boss, why not compete against him directly? Scott Adams based <em>Dilbert</em> on his career at Pacific Bell in the 80s. Can you imagine quitting Pacific Bell in the 80s to, uh, found your own Pacific Bell? To go to Michael Milken or whoever was investing back then, and say &#8220;Excuse me, may I have $10 billion to create my own version of Pacific Bell, only better?&#8221; But if someone were to try to be Dilbert today &#8211; to say, earnestly, &#8220;I hate my job because I am smarter than my boss and could do it better than him,&#8221; that would be the obvious next question, the same way &#8220;I am better at picking stocks than Wall Street&#8221; ought to be followed up with &#8220;Then why don&#8217;t you invest?&#8221;</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0gjb!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4424733-f094-4a82-a17b-e25353179c51_790x242.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"202.1772151898734\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0gjb!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4424733-f094-4a82-a17b-e25353179c51_790x242.png\" width=\"660\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Above, I described &#8220;the nerd experience&#8221; of &#8220;being smarter than everyone else, not just in the sense of being high IQ, but in the sense of being the only sane man in a crazy world where everyone else spends their days listening to overpaid consultants drone on about mission statements instead of doing anything useful.&#8221; You nodded along, because you knew the only possible conclusion to the arc suggested by that sentence was to tear it down, to launch a tirade about how that nerd is naive and narcissistic and probably somehow also a racist. In the year of our Lord 2026, of course that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m going. </p><p>Dilbert is a relic of a simpler time, when the trope could be played straight. But it&#8217;s also an artifact of the transition, maybe even a driver of it. Scott Adams appreciated these considerations earlier and more acutely than anyone else. And they drove him nuts.</p><h2>Stick To Drawing Comics, Monkey Brain</h2><p>Adams knew, deep in his bones, that he was cleverer than other people. God always punishes this impulse, especially in nerds. His usual strategy is straightforward enough: let them reach the advanced physics classes, where there will always be someone smarter than them, then beat them on the head with their own intellectual inferiority so many times that they cry uncle and admit they&#8217;re nothing special.</p><p>For Adams, God took a more creative and &#8211; dare I say, crueler &#8211; route. He created him only-slightly-above-average at everything <em>except</em> for a world-historical, Mozart-tier, absolutely Leonardo-level skill at making silly comics about hating work.</p><p>Scott Adams never forgave this. Too self-aware to deny it, too narcissistic to accept it, he spent his life searching for a loophole. You can read his frustration in his book titles: <em>How To Fail At Almost Everything And Still Win Big. Trapped In A Dilbert World. Stick To Drawing Comics, Monkey Brain. </em>Still, he refused to stick to comics. For a moment in the late-90s, with books like <em>The Dilbert Principle</em> and <em>The Dilbert Future</em>, he seemed on his way to be becoming a semi-serious business intellectual. He never quite made it, maybe because the Dilbert Principle wasn&#8217;t really what managers and consultants wanted to hear:</p><blockquote><p>I wrote <em>The Dilbert Principle</em> around the concept that in many cases the least competent, least smart people are promoted, simply because they&#8217;re the ones you don't want doing actual work. You want them ordering the doughnuts and yelling at people for not doing their assignments&#8212;you know, the easy work. Your heart surgeons and your computer programmers&#8212;your smart people&#8212;aren't in management.</p></blockquote><p>Okay, &#8220;I am cleverer than everyone else&#8221;, got it. His next venture (c. 1999) was the Dilberito, an attempt to revolutionize food via a Dilbert-themed burrito with the full Recommended Daily Allowance of twenty-three vitamins. I swear I am not making this up. A contemporaneous NYT review <a href=\"https://archive.is/Whxeo#selection-507.59-507.170\">said</a> it &#8220;could have been designed only by a food technologist or by someone who eats lunch without much thought to taste&#8221;. The Onion, in its twenty year retrospective for the doomed comestible, <a href=\"https://www.avclub.com/in-memory-of-the-dilberito-a-stomach-ruining-dilbert-t-1842213522\">called it</a> a frustrated groping towards meal replacements like Soylent or Huel, long before the existence of a culture nerdy enough to support them. Adams himself, looking back from several years&#8217; distance, was even more scathing: &#8220;the mineral fortification was hard to disguise, and because of the veggie and legume content, three bites of the Dilberito made you fart so hard your intestines formed a tail.&#8221;</p><p>His second foray into the culinary world was a local restaurant called Stacey&#8217;s. The New York Times does a pitch-perfect job covering the results. <a href=\"https://archive.is/SLGJJ#selection-2213.31-2217.185\">Their article starts</a>:</p><blockquote><p>This is yet another story about a clueless but obtrusive boss &#8212; the kind of meddlesome manager you might laugh at in the panels of &#8220;Dilbert,&#8221; the daily comic strip.</p></blockquote><p>&#8230;and continues through a description of Adams making every possible rookie mistake. As the restaurant does worse and worse, Adams becomes more and more convinced that he has to figure out some clever lifehack that will turn things around and revolutionize restaurants. First he comes up with a theory that light is the key to restauranting, and spends ages fiddling with the windows. When this fails, he devolves into an unmistakable sign of desperation - asking blog commenters for advice:</p><blockquote><p>He also turned to Dilbert fans for suggestions on how to use the party room, in a posting on his blog titled &#8220;Oh Great Blog Brain.&#8221; The Dilbert faithful responded with more than 1,300 comments, mixing interesting ideas (interactive murder-mystery theater) with unlikely mischief (nude volleyball tournaments). Mr. Adams asked his employees to read the comments and is now slowly trying some of them.</p></blockquote><p>But what makes this article truly perfect - I can&#8217;t believe it didn&#8217;t get a Pulitzer - is that it&#8217;s not some kind of hostile ambush profile. Adams is totally self-aware. He <em>also</em> finds the whole situation hilarious! Everyone involved is in on the joke! The waiters find it hilarious! After every workday, Adams and the waiters get together and laugh long into the night together about how bad a boss Adams is!</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mCyd!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09870ae8-3f63-4db7-8523-2f38bb2a3900_600x280.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"Scott Adams, Creator of the Satirical 'Dilbert' Comic Strip, Dies at 68 -  The New York Times\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"304.26666666666665\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mCyd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09870ae8-3f63-4db7-8523-2f38bb2a3900_600x280.jpeg\" title=\"Scott Adams, Creator of the Satirical 'Dilbert' Comic Strip, Dies at 68 -  The New York Times\" width=\"652\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>There&#8217;s a running joke about how if you see a business that loses millions yearly, it&#8217;s probably run by some banker&#8217;s wife who&#8217;s getting subsidized to feel good about herself and pretend she has a high-powered job. I think this is approximately what was going on with Stacey&#8217;s. Adams made enough money off Dilbert that he could indulge his fantasies of being something more than &#8220;the Dilbert guy&#8221;. For a moment, he could think of himself as a temporarily-embarrassed businessman, rather than just a fantastically successful humorist. The same probably explains his forays into television (&#8220;Dilbert: The Animated Series&#8221;), non-Dilbert comics (&#8220;Plop: The Hairless Elbonian&#8221;), and technology (&#8221;WhenHub&#8221;, his site offering &#8220;live chats with subject-matter experts&#8221;, which was shelved after he awkwardly tried to build publicity by suggesting that mass shooting witnesses could profit by using his site to tell their stories.)</p><p>Adams and Elon Musk occasionally talked <em>about</em> each other - usually to defend one another against media criticism of their respective racist rants - but I don&#8217;t know if they ever met. I wonder what it would have been like if they did. I imagine them coming together at some Bay Area house party on copious amounts of LSD or MDMA. One, the world&#8217;s greatest comic writer, who more than anything else wanted to succeed in business. The other, the world&#8217;s greatest businessman, who more than anything else wanted people to think that he&#8217;s funny. Scott Adams couldn&#8217;t stop frittering his talent and fortune on doomed attempts to be taken seriously. But someday Elon Musk will buy America for $100 trillion, tell the UN that he&#8217;s renaming it &#8220;the United States of 420-69&#8221;, and the assembled ambassadors will be as silent as the grave. Are there psychic gains from trade to be had between two such people?</p><p>Michael Jordan was the world&#8217;s best basketball player, and insisted on testing himself against baseball, where he failed. <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/17/book-review-hoover/\">Herbert Hoover</a> was one of the world&#8217;s best businessmen, and insisted on testing himself against politics, where he crashed and burned. We&#8217;re all inmates in prisons of different names. Most of us accept it and get on with our lives. Adams couldn&#8217;t stop rattling the bars.</p><h2>I&#8217;m No Scientist, But I Think Feng Shui Is Part Of The Answer</h2><p>Having failed his forays into business, Adams turned to religion. Not in the sense of seeking consolation through God&#8217;s love. In the sense of trying to show how clever he was by figuring out the true nature of the Divine</p><p>The result was <em><a href=\"https://fringe.davesource.com/Fringe/Entertainment/Books/Scott_Adams.Gods_Debris.pdf\">God&#8217;s Debris</a></em>. This is a breathtakingly bad book. On some level, Adams (of course) seemed to realize this, but (of course) his self-awareness only made things worse. In the second-worst introduction to a work of spiritual wisdom I&#8217;ve ever read (<a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/book-review-beelzebubs-tales-to-his\">Gurdjieff keeps first place by a hair</a>), he explains that this is JUST A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT and IF YOU TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, YOU FAIL. But also, <em>it really makes you think</em>, and it&#8217;s going to <em>blow your mind</em>, and you&#8217;ll spend the rest of your life <em>secretly wondering whether it was true</em>, but it won&#8217;t be, because IT&#8217;S JUST A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT, and IF YOU TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, YOU FAIL. Later, in <a href=\"https://archive.is/JPHTB\">a Bloomberg interview</a>, he would say that this book - and not Dilbert - would be his &#8220;ultimate legacy&#8221; to the world. But remember, IT&#8217;S JUST A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT, and IF YOU TAKE IT SERIOUSLY YOU FAIL.</p><p>I read it for the first time while researching this essay. The frame story is that a delivery boy gives a package to the wisest man in the universe, who invites him to stay a while and discuss philosophy (REMEMBER, IT&#8217;S JUST A WORK OF FICTION! THESE ARE ONLY CHARACTERS!) Their discussion is one-quarter classic philosophical problems that seemed deep when you were nineteen, presented with no reference to any previous work:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;There has to be a God,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Otherwise, none of us would be here.&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t much of a reason, but I figured he didn&#8217;t need more.</p><p>&#8220;Do you believe God is omnipotent and that people have free will?&#8221; he asked.</p><p>&#8220;That&#8217;s standard stuff for God. So, yeah.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;If God is omnipotent, wouldn&#8217;t he know the future?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;If God knows what the future holds, then all our choices are already made, aren&#8217;t they? Free will must be an illusion.&#8221;</p><p>He was clever, but I wasn&#8217;t going to fall for that trap. &#8220;God lets us determine the future ourselves, using our free will,&#8221; I explained.</p><p>&#8220;Then you believe God doesn&#8217;t know the future?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I guess not,&#8221; I admitted. &#8220;But he must prefer not knowing.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>There is an ongoing meta-discussion among philosophy discussers of how acceptable it is to propose your own answers to the great questions without having fully mastered previous scholarship. On the one hand, philosophy is one of the most fundamental human activities, gating it behind the near-impossible task of having read every previous philosopher is elitist and gives self-appointed guardians of scholarship a permanent heckler&#8217;s veto on any new ideas, and it can create a culture so obsessed with citing every possible influence that eventually the part where you have an opinion withers away and philosophy becomes a meaningless ritual of presenting citations without conclusion. On the other hand, this book.</p><p>Another quarter is philosophical questions which did not seem deep, even when you were nineteen, and which nobody has ever done work on, because nobody except Scott Adams ever even thought they were worth considering:</p><blockquote><p>What makes a holy land holy?&#8221; he asked.</p><p>&#8220;Well, usually it&#8217;s because some important religious event took place there.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;What does it mean to say that something took place in a particular location when we know that the earth is constantly in motion, rotating on its axis and orbiting the sun? And we&#8217;re in a moving galaxy that is part of an expanding universe. Even if you had a spaceship and could fly anywhere, you can never return to the location of a past event. There would be no equivalent of the past location because location depends on your distance from other objects, and all objects in the universe would have moved considerably by then.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I see your point, but on Earth the holy places keep their relationship to other things on Earth, and those things don&#8217;t move much,&#8221; I said.</p><p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s say you dug up all the dirt and rocks and vegetation of a holy place and moved it someplace else, leaving nothing but a hole that is one mile deep in the original location. Would the holy land now be the new location where you put the dirt and rocks and vegetation, or the old location with the hole?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I think both would be considered holy,&#8221; I said, hedging my bets.</p><p>&#8220;Suppose you took only the very top layer of soil and vegetation from the holy place, the newer stuff that blew in or grew after the religious event occurred thousands of years ago. Would the place you dumped the topsoil and vegetation be holy?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a little trickier,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll say the new location isn&#8217;t holy because the topsoil that you moved there isn&#8217;t itself holy, it was only in contact with holy land. If holy land could turn anything that touched it into more holy land, then the whole planet would be holy.&#8221;</p><p>The old man smiled. &#8220;The concept of location is a useful delusion when applied to real estate ownership, or when giving someone directions to the store. But when it is viewed through the eyes of an omnipotent God, the concept of location is absurd. While we speak, nations are arming themselves to fight for control of lands they consider holy. They are trapped in the delusion that locations are real things, not just fictions of the mind. Many will die.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Another quarter of the discussion is the most pusillanimous possible subjectivism, as if <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/03/against-anton-wilsonism/\">Robert Anton Wilson</a> and the 2004 film <em>What the #$*! Do We Know!?</em> had a kid, then strangled it at birth until it came out brain damaged. We get passages like these:</p><blockquote><p> &#8220;I am saying that UFOs, reincarnation, and God are all equal in terms of their reality.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Do you mean equally real or equally imaginary?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Your question reveals your bias for a binary world where everything is either real or imaginary. That distinction lies in your perceptions, not in the universe. Your inability to see other possibilities and your lack of vocabulary are your brain&#8217;s limits, not the universe&#8217;s.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;There has to be a difference between real and imagined things,&#8221; I countered. &#8220;My truck is real. The Easter Bunny is imagined. Those are different.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;As you sit here, your truck exists for you only in your memory, a place in your mind. The Easter Bunny lives in the same place. They are equal.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>I remember the late &#8216;90s and early &#8216;00s; I was (regrettably) there. For some reason, all this stuff was considered the height of wisdom back then. The actual Buddhist classics were hard to access, but everyone assumed that Buddhists were wise and they probably said, you know, something like this. If you said stuff like this, you could be wise too.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CJFp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ac7f550-5272-47b1-bda1-62ce81fbd6f8_789x251.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"223.32319391634982\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CJFp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ac7f550-5272-47b1-bda1-62ce81fbd6f8_789x251.png\" width=\"702\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The final quarter of the book is a shockingly original take on the Lurianic kabbalah. I&#8216;m not pleased to report this, and Adams likely would have been very surprised to learn it. Still, the resemblance is unmistakable. The wisest man in the world, charged with answering all of the philosophical problems that bothered you when you were nineteen, tells the following story: if God exists, He must be perfect. Therefore, the only thing he lacks is nonexistence. Therefore, in order to fill that lack, He must destroy himself in order to create the universe. The universe is composed of the fragments of that destruction - the titular God&#8217;s Debris. Its point is to reassemble itself into God. Partially-reassembled-God is not yet fully conscious, but there is some sort of instinct within His fragments - ie within the universe - that is motivated to help orchestrate the self-reassembly, and it is this instinct which causes anti-entropic processes like evolution. Good things are good because they aid in the reassembly of God; bad things are bad because they hinder it.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!F9j6!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6540e2a8-de36-4d52-9b55-300e2270b739_738x241.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"214.87533875338752\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!F9j6!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6540e2a8-de36-4d52-9b55-300e2270b739_738x241.png\" width=\"658\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Adams&#8217; version adds several innovations to this basic story. Whatever parts of God aren&#8217;t involved in physical matter have become the laws of probability; this explains the otherwise inexplicable evolutionary coincidences that created humankind. There&#8217;s something about how gravity is produced by some sort of interference between different divine corpuscules - Adams admits that Einstein probably also had useful things to say about gravity, but probably his own version amounts to the same thing, and it&#8217;s easier to understand, and that makes it better (IT&#8217;S JUST A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT! IF YOU TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, YOU FAIL.) But my favorite part is the augmentation of Luria with Nick Land: the final (or one of the final) steps in the divine reassembly is the creation of the Internet, aka &#8220;God&#8217;s nervous system&#8221;, which will connect everything to everything else and give the whole system awareness of its divine purpose. </p><p>I&#8217;m honestly impressed that a Gentile worked all of this out on his own. Adams completes the performance by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kegan#The_Evolving_Self\">reinventing Kegan levels</a> (this time I&#8217;m agnostic as to whether it&#8217;s convergent evolution or simple plagiarism), although characteristically it is in the most annoying way possible:</p><blockquote><p>[The wise man] described what he called the five levels of awareness and said that all humans experience the first level of awareness at birth. That is when you first become aware that you exist.</p><p>In the second level of awareness you understand that other people exist. You believe most of what you are told by authority figures. You accept the belief system in which you are raised.</p><p>At the third level of awareness you recognize that humans are often wrong about the things they believe. You feel that you might be wrong about some of your own beliefs but you don&#8217;t know which ones. Despite your doubts, you still find comfort in your beliefs.</p><p>The fourth level is skepticism. You believe the scientific method is the best measure of what is true and you believe you have a good working grasp of truth, thanks to science, your logic, and your senses. You are arrogant when it comes to dealing with people in levels two and three. </p><p>The fifth level of awareness is the Avatar. The Avatar understands that the mind is an illusion generator, not a window to reality. The Avatar recognizes science as a belief system, albeit a useful one. An Avatar is aware of God&#8217;s power as expressed in probability and the inevitable recombination of God consciousness.</p></blockquote><p>I think going through every David Chapman essay and replacing the word &#8220;metarationality&#8221; with &#8220;THE AVATAR&#8221; would actually be very refreshing.</p><p>What are we to make of all of this?</p><p>Nothing is more American than inventing weird cringe fusions of religion and atheism where you say that God doesn&#8217;t exist as (<em>gestures upward)</em> some Big Man In The Sky the way <em>those people</em> believe, but also, there totally is a God, in some complicated sense which only I understand. When Thomas Jefferson cut all the passages with miracles out of his Bible, he was already standing on the shoulders of generations of Unitarians, Quakers, and Latitudinarians.</p><p>This was augmented by the vagaries of nerd culture&#8217;s intersection with the sci-fi fandom. The same people who wanted to read about spaceships and ray guns also wanted to read about psionics and Atlantis, so the smart sci-fi nerd consensus morphed into something like &#8220;probably all that unexplained stuff is real, but has a scientific explanation&#8221;. Telepathy is made up of quantum particles, or whatever (I talk about this more in <a href=\"https://asteriskmag.com/issues/09/deros-and-the-ur-abduction\">my article on the Shaver Mystery</a>). It became a nerd rite of passage to come up with your own theory that reconciled the spiritual and the material in the most creative way possible.</p><p>And the Nineties (<em>God&#8217;s Debris</em> was published in 2001) were a special time. The decade began with the peak of Wicca and neopaganism. Contra current ideological fault lines, where these tendencies bring up images of Etsy witches, they previously dominated nerd circles, including male nerds, techie nerds, and right-wing nerds (did you know <a href=\"https://naturalisticpaganism.org/2015/06/26/neopaganism-faq-y-eric-s-raymond/\">Eric S. Raymond is neopagan</a>?) By decade&#8217;s end, the cleverest (ie most annoying) nerds were switching to New Atheism; throughout, smaller groups were exploring Discordianism, chaos magick, and the Subgenius. The common thread was that Christianity had lost its hegemonic status, part of being a clever nerd was patting yourself on the back for having seen through it, but exactly what would replace it was still uncertain, and there was still enough piety in the water supply that people were uncomfortable forgetting about religion entirely. You either had to make a very conscious, marked choice to stop believing (New Atheism), or try your hand at the task of inventing some kind of softer middle ground (neopaganism, Eastern religion, various cults, whatever this book was supposed to be).</p><h2>It&#8217;s Obvious You Won&#8217;t Survive By Your Wits Alone</h2><p>Adams spent his life obsessed with self-help. Even more than a businessman or a prophet, he wanted to be a self-help guru. Of course he did. His particular package of woo -  a combination of hypnosis, persuasion hacks, and social skills advice - unified the two great motifs of his life.</p><p><strong>Thesis:</strong> I am cleverer than everyone else.</p><p><strong>Antithesis:</strong> I always lose to the Pointy-Haired Boss.</p><p><strong>Synthesis:</strong> I was trying to be rational. But most people are irrational sheep; they can be directed only by charismatic manipulators who play on their biases, not by rational persuasion. But now I&#8217;m back to being cleverer than everyone else, because I noticed this. Also, I should become a charismatic manipulator.</p><p>I phrased this in a maximally hostile way, but it&#8217;s not wrong. And Adams started off strong. He read Dale Carnegie&#8217;s <em>How To Win Friends And Influence People</em>, widely agreed to be the classic book on social skills. </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JcRf!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e140557-d2a8-4a76-af05-e9b75aac3571_734x247.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"224.11716621253407\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JcRf!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e140557-d2a8-4a76-af05-e9b75aac3571_734x247.png\" title=\"\" width=\"666\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Then, in search of even stronger persuasion techniques, he turned to hypnosis. This has a bad reputation, but I basically buy that something is there. Psychiatry has <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_H._Erickson\">legends of psychotherapist-hypnotists</a> who achieved amazing things, and there&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/practically-a-book-review-byrnes\">a plausible scientific story for why it might work</a>. So when Adams claimed to be a master hypnotist, I was originally willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>That lasted until I read <em><a href=\"https://www.smays.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/The-Religion-War-Scott-Adams.pdf\">The Religion War</a></em><a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/feed#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a><em>, </em>Adams&#8217; sequel to <em>God&#8217;s Debris</em>. In the intro, which may be literally the most annoying passage ever written in all two million years of human history, he discusses the reception of the original book:</p><blockquote><p>This is a sequel to my book <em>God&#8217;s Debris</em>, a story about a deliveryman who chances upon the smartest person in the world and learns the secrets of reality. I subtitled that book <em>A Thought Experiment</em> and used a variety of hypnosis techniques in an attempt to produce a feeling of euphoric enlightenment in the reader similar to what the main character would feel while discovering the (fictionally) true nature of reality. Reactions to the book were all over the map. About half of the people who e-mailed me said they felt various flavors of euphoria, expanded awareness, connectedness, and other weird sensations that defied description. A surprising number of people reported reading the entire book twice in one day. So I know something was happening.</p><p>Other people wrote angry letters and scathing reviews, pointing out the logical and factual flaws in the book. It is full of flaws, and much of the science is made up, as it states in the introduction. I explained that the reader is supposed to be looking for flaws. That&#8217;s what makes the experiment work. You might think this group of readers skipped the introduction and missed the stated point of the book, but I suspect that something else is going on. People get a kind of cognitive dissonance (brain cramp) when their worldview is disturbed. It&#8217;s fun to watch.</p></blockquote><p>I previously felt bad for writing this essay after Adams&#8217; death; it seems kind of unsporting to disagree with someone who can&#8217;t respond. These paragraphs cured me of my misgivings: after his death is by far the best time to disagree with Scott Adams.</p><p>The book is a novel (a real novel this time, with plot and everything) meant to dramatize the lessons of its predecessor. In the near future, the Muslims and Christians are on the verge of global war. Adams&#8217; self-insert character, the Avatar, goes around hypnotizing and mind hacking everyone into cooperating with his hare-brained scheme for world peace. </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KK2t!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1ea1b28-68d6-48ee-a507-bd1454402c1f_790x253.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"219.05316455696203\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KK2t!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1ea1b28-68d6-48ee-a507-bd1454402c1f_790x253.png\" width=\"684\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>In an early chapter, the Christian alliance has captured the Avatar and sent him to be tortured. But the Avatar masterfully deflects the torturer&#8217;s attention with a bit of cold reading, some pointed questions, and a few hypnotic suggestions:</p><blockquote><p>As the Avatar planned, the interrogator&#8217;s conscious mind was scrambled by the emotions and thoughts of the past minutes. This brutish man, accustomed to avoiding deep thoughts, had imagined the tiniest particles of the universe, his childhood, and the battles of the future. He had laughed, felt pain and pity, been intellectually stimulated, confused, assured, and uncertain. The Avatar had challenged his worldview, and it was evaporating, leaving him feeling empty, unimportant, and purposeless</p></blockquote><p>In the thrilling climax, which takes place at Stacey&#8217;s Cafe (yes, it&#8217;s the real-world restaurant Adams was managing - yes, he turned his religious-apocalyptic thriller novel into an ad for his restaurant - yes, I bet he thought of this as a &#8220;hypnotic suggestion&#8221;), the characters find the Prime Influencer. She is able to come up with a short snappy slogan so memetically powerful that it defeats fundamentalist religion and ends the war (the slogan is: &#8220;If God is so smart, why do you fart?&#8221;). Adams&#8217; mouthpiece character says:</p><blockquote><p>It wasn&#8217;t the wisdom of the question that made it so powerful; philosophers had posed better questions for aeons. It was the packaging&#8212;the marketing, if you will&#8212;the repeatability and simplicity, the timing, the Zeitgeist, and in the end, the fact that everyone eventually heard it from someone whose opinion they trusted.The question was short, provocative, and cast in the language of international commerce that almost everyone understood&#8212;English. Most important, and generally overlooked by historians: It rhymed and it was funny. Once you heard it, you could never forget it. It looped in the brain, gaining the weight and feel of truth with each repetition. Human brains have a limited capacity for logic and evidence. Throughout time, repetition and frequency were how people decided what was most true.</p></blockquote><p>This paragraph is the absolute center of Adams&#8217; worldview (later expanded to book length several times in tomes named things like <em>Win Bigly: Persuasion In A World Where Facts Don&#8217;t Matter)</em>. People don&#8217;t respond to logic and evidence, so the world is ruled by people who are good at making catchy slogans. Sufficiently advanced sloganeering is indistinguishable from hypnosis, and so when Adams has some cute turns of phrase in his previous book, he describes it as &#8220;[I] used a variety of hypnosis techniques in an attempt to produce a feeling of euphoric enlightenment in the reader&#8221;. This is the cringiest way possible to describe cute turns of phrase, and turns me off from believing any his further claims to hypnotic mastery.</p><p>Throughout this piece, I&#8217;ve tried to emphasize that Adams was usually pretty self-aware. Did that include the hypnosis stuff? I&#8217;m not sure. I think he would have answered: certainly some people are great charismatic manipulators. Either their skills are magic, or they operate by some physical law. If they operate by physical law, they should be learnable. Maybe I&#8217;m not quite Steve Jobs level yet, but I <em>have to </em>be <em>somewhere </em>along the path to becoming Steve Jobs, right? And why not describe it in impressive terms? <em>Steve Jobs</em> would have come up with impressive-sounding terms for any skills he had, and you would have believed him!</p><p>Every few months, some group of bright nerds in San Francisco has the same idea: we&#8217;ll use our intelligence to hack ourselves to become hot and hard-working and charismatic and persuasive, then reap the benefits of all those things! This is such a seductive idea, there&#8217;s no reason whatsoever that it shouldn&#8217;t work, and every yoga studio and therapist&#8217;s office in the Bay Area has a little shed in the back where they keep the skulls of the last ten thousand bright nerds who tried this. I can&#8217;t explain why it so invariably goes wrong. The best I can do is tell a story where, when you&#8217;re trying to do this, you&#8217;re selecting for <em>either</em> techniques that can change you, <em>or</em> techniques that can compellingly make you think you&#8217;ve been changed. The latter are much more common than the former. And the most successful parasites are always those which can alter their host environment to be more amenable to themselves, and if you&#8217;re a parasite taking the form of a bad idea, that means hijacking your host&#8217;s rationality. So you&#8217;re really selecting for things that are compelling, seductive, and damage your ability to tell good ideas from bad ones. This is a just-so story that I have no evidence for - but seriously, go to someone who has the words &#8220;human potential&#8221; on their business card and ask them if you can see the skull shed.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HbAX!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9bad58b1-11da-4401-8f75-a9408e6ca035_900x280.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"Dilbert Power Pose - Fretboard Anatomy\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"206.57777777777778\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!HbAX!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9bad58b1-11da-4401-8f75-a9408e6ca035_900x280.gif\" title=\"Dilbert Power Pose - Fretboard Anatomy\" width=\"664\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>But also: it&#8217;s attractive to be an effortlessly confident alpha male who oozes masculinity.

But the uncanny valley is deep and wide, and Scott Adams was too invested in saying &#8220;Ha! I just hypnotized you - ha! There, did it again!&#8221; for me to trust his mountaineering skills.</p><h2>Don&#8217;t Step In The Leadership</h2><p>It all led, inexorably, to Trump.</p><p>In summer 2015, Trump came down his escalator and announced his presidential candidacy. Given his comic status, his beyond-the-pale views, and his competition with a crowded field including Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz, traditional media wrote him off. Sure, he immediately led in the polls, but political history was full of weirdos who got brief poll bumps eighteen months before an election only to burn out later. The prediction markets listed his chance of the nomination (not the Presidency!) at 5%.</p><p>Which made it especially jarring when, in August, Scott Adams wrote a blog post asserting that Trump had &#8220;a 98% chance&#8221; of winning. This claim received national attention, because Trump was dominating the news cycle and Adams was approximately the only person, anywhere, who thought he had a chance. </p><p>There are two ways to make historically good predictions. The first way is to be some kind of brilliant superforecaster. Adams wasn&#8217;t this. Every big prediction he made after this one failed. Wikipedia notes that he dominated a Politico feature called &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/12/29/2023-worst-political-predictions-00132568\">The Absolute Worst Political Prediction of 20XX</a>&#8221;, with the authors even remarking that he &#8220;has managed to appear on this annual roundup of the worst predictions in politics more than any other person on the planet&#8221;. His most famous howler was that if Biden won in 2020, Republicans &#8220;would be hunted&#8221; and his Republican readers would &#8220;most likely be dead within a year&#8221;. But other highlights include &#8220;a major presidential candidate will die of COVID&#8221;, &#8220;the Supreme Court will overturn the 2024 election&#8221;, and &#8220;Hillary Clinton will start a race war&#8221;.</p><p>The other way to make a great prediction is to live your entire life for one perfect moment - the inveterate bear who predicted twelve of the last zero recessions, but now it&#8217;s 2008 and you look like a genius. By 2015, Adams had become a broken record around one point: people are irrational sheep who are prey for charismatic manipulators. <em>The pointy-haired boss always wins</em>. Trump was the pointiest-haired person in the vicinity, and he was obviously trying to charismatically play on people&#8217;s instincts while other people were doing comparatively normal politics.

He went from news outlet to news outlet saying &#8220;As a trained hypnotist, I can tell you what tricks Trump is using to bamboozle his followers, given that rational persuasion is fake and marketing techniques alone turn the wheels of history,&#8221; and the news outlets ate it up.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!V5QG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd736f2b0-eb7d-472f-84ef-c9665d204db9_1512x2016.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"Image\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"527.9093406593406\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!V5QG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd736f2b0-eb7d-472f-84ef-c9665d204db9_1512x2016.jpeg\" title=\"Image\" width=\"396\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">You probably thought I was making up the part where Scott Adams has a custom-built tower shaped like Dilbert&#8217;s head.</figcaption></figure></div><p>And some of his commentary was good. He was one of the first people to point out the classic Trump overreach, where he would say something like &#8220;Sleepy Joe Biden let in twenty trillion illegal immigrants!&#8221; The liberal media would take the bait and say &#8220;FACT CHECK: False! - Joe Biden only let in five million illegal immigrants!&#8221;, and thousands of people who had never previously been exposed to any narrative-threatening information would think &#8220;Wait, Joe Biden let in five million illegal immigrants?!&#8221; Once you notice it, it&#8217;s hard to unsee. </p><p>Adams started out by stressing that he was politically independent. He didn&#8217;t <em>support</em> Trump, he was just the outside hypnosis expert pointing out what Trump was doing. IT&#8217;S JUST A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT, IF YOU TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, YOU FAIL. Indeed, &#8220;this person is a charismatic manipulator hacking the minds of irrational sheep&#8221; is hardly a pro-Trump take. And he lived in Pleasanton, California - a member in good standing of the San Francisco metropolitan area - and nice Pleasantonians simply did not become Trump supporters in 2016.</p><p>On the other hand, at some point, his increasingly overblown theories of Trump&#8217;s greatness opened up a little wedge. The growing MAGA movement started treating him as one of their own; liberals started to see him as an enemy. His fame turned the All-Seeing Eye of social media upon him, that gaze which no man may meet without consequence. Once you&#8217;re sufficiently prominent, politics becomes a separating equilibrium; if you lean even slightly to one side, the other will pile on you <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-psychopolitics-of-trauma\">so massively and traumatically</a> that it will force you into their opponents&#8217; open arms just for a shred of psychological security.</p><p>As he had done so many other times during his life, he resolved the conflict in the dumbest, cringiest, and most public way possible: a June 2016 blog post announcing that he was endorsing Hillary Clinton, for his own safety, because he suspected he would be targeted for assassination if he didn&#8217;t:</p><blockquote><p>This past week we saw Clinton pair the idea of President Trump with nuclear disaster, racism, Hitler, the Holocaust, and whatever else makes you tremble in fear. That is good persuasion if you can pull it off because fear is a strong motivator. It is also a sharp pivot from Clinton&#8217;s prior approach of talking about her mastery of policy details, her experience, and her gender. Trump took her so-called &#8220;woman card&#8221; and turned it into a liability. So Clinton wisely pivoted. Her new scare tactics are solid-gold persuasion. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if you see Clinton&#8217;s numbers versus Trump improve in June, at least temporarily, until Trump finds a counter-move.</p><p>The only downside I can see to the new approach is that it is likely to trigger a race war in the United States. And I would be a top-ten assassination target in that scenario [&#8230;]</p><p>So I&#8217;ve decided to endorse Hillary Clinton for President, for my personal safety. Trump supporters don&#8217;t have any bad feelings about patriotic Americans such as myself, so I&#8217;ll be safe from that crowd. But Clinton supporters have convinced me &#8211; and here I am being 100% serious &#8211; that my safety is at risk if I am seen as supportive of Trump. So I&#8217;m taking the safe way out and endorsing Hillary Clinton for president.</p><p>As I have often said, I have no psychic powers and I don&#8217;t know which candidate would be the best president. But I do know which outcome is most likely to get me killed by my fellow citizens. So for safety reason, I&#8217;m on team Clinton.</p><p>My <em><strong>prediction</strong></em> remains that Trump will win in a landslide based on his superior persuasion skills. But don&#8217;t blame me for anything President Trump does in office because I endorse Clinton.</p></blockquote><p>This somehow failed to be a masterstroke of hypnotic manipulation that left both sides placated. But it was fine, because Trump won anyway! In the New Right&#8217;s wave of exultation, all was forgiven, and the first high-profile figure to bet on Trump became a local hero and confirmed prophet.  Never mind that Adams had predicted Trump would win by &#8220;one of the biggest margins we&#8217;ve seen in recent history&#8221; when in fact he lost the popular vote. The man who had dreamed all his life of being respected for something other than cartooning had finally made it.</p><p>Obviously, it destroyed him.</p><p>At first, I wondered if Adams&#8217; right-wing turn was a calculated manuever. He&#8217;d always longed to be a manipulator of lesser humans, and had finally achieved slightly-above-zero skill at it. Wouldn&#8217;t it fit his personality to see the right-wingers as dumb sheep, and himself as the clever Dogbert-style scammer who could profit off them? Did he really believe (as he claimed) that he was at risk of being assassinated by left-wing radicals who couldn&#8217;t handle his level of insight into Trump&#8217;s genius? Or was this just another hypnotic suggestion, retrospectively justified insofar as we&#8217;re still talking about it ten years later and all publicity is good publicity?</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IpkI!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0002d718-fe7e-495a-8838-af19360dada1_785x253.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"228.828025477707\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IpkI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0002d718-fe7e-495a-8838-af19360dada1_785x253.png\" width=\"710\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>But I don&#8217;t think he did it cynically. At the turn of the millennium, the obsessed-with-their-own-cleverness demographic leaned firmly liberal: smug New Atheists, hardline skeptics, members of the &#8220;reality-based community&#8221;. But in the 2010s, liberalism became the default, the public switched to expertolatry, dumb people&#8217;s orthodoxies about race and gender became easier and more fun to puncture than dumb people&#8217;s orthodoxies about religion - and the O.W.T.O.C.s lurched right. Adams was borne along by the tide.

href=\"https://scottadams.locals.com/post/4617146/dilbert-reborn-9-22-23\">source</a>)</figcaption></figure></div><p>There&#8217;s a passage in the intro to one of Adams books where he says that, given how he&#8217;s going to <em>blow your mind</em> and <em>totally puncture everything you previously believed</em>, perhaps the work is unsuitable for people above fifty-five, whose brains are comparatively sclerotic and might shatter at the strain. This is how I feel about post-2016 politics. Young people were mostly able to weather the damage. As for older people, I have seen public intellectual after public intellectual who I previously respected have their brains turn to puddles of partisan-flavored mush. Jordan Peterson, Ken White, Curtis Yarvin, Paul Krugman, Elon Musk, the Weinsteins, [various people close enough to me that it would be impolite to name them here]. Once, these people were lions of insightful debate. Where now are the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? </p><p>Adams was 58 when Trump changed everything. In 2001, age 44, he&#8217;d found the failure of his Dilberito funny. But in another interview, at age 50, he suggested that maybe his competitors had formed teams to sneak into supermarkets and hide them in the back of the shelves. Being tragically flawed yet also self-aware enough to laugh about it is a young man&#8217;s game. </p><p>In 2024, diagnosed with terminal cancer, Adams decided to treat it via ivermectin, according to a protocol recommended by fellow right-wing contrarian Dr. William Makis. This doesn&#8217;t seem to me like a story about a cynic milking right-wingers for the grift. It sounds like a true believer. Scott Adams, the man too clever and independent to join any political tendency, who had sworn to always be the master manipulator standing above the fray rather than a sheep with ordinary object-level opinions - had finally succumbed to sincere belief.</p><h2>It&#8217;s Not Funny If I Have To Explain It</h2><p>Every child is hypomanic, convinced of their own specialness. Even most teenagers still suspect that, if everything went right, they could change the world.</p><p>It&#8217;s not just nerds. Everyone has to crash into reality. The guitar player who starts a garage band in order to become a rockstar. The varsity athlete who wants to make the big leagues. They all eventually realize, no, I&#8217;m mediocre. Even the ones who aren&#8217;t mediocre, the ones with some special talent, only have one special talent (let&#8217;s say cartooning) and no more.</p><p>I don&#8217;t know how the musicians and athletes cope. I hear stories about washed-up alcoholic former high school quarterbacks forever telling their girlfriends about how if Coach had only put them in for the last quarter during the big game, things would have gone differently. But since most writers are nerds, it&#8217;s the nerds who dominate the discussion, so much so that the whole affair gets dubbed &#8220;Former Gifted Kid Syndrome&#8221;.</p><p>Every nerd who was the smartest kid in their high school goes to an appropriately-ranked college and realizes they&#8217;re nothing special. But also, once they go into some specific field they find that intellect, as versatile as it is, can only take them so far. And for someone who was told their whole childhood that they were going to cure cancer (alas, a real quote from my elementary school teacher), it&#8217;s a tough pill to swallow.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_formation\">Reaction formation</a>, </em>where you replace a unbearable feeling with its exact opposite, is one of the all time great Freudian defense mechanisms. You may remember it from such classics as &#8220;rape victims fall in love with their rapist&#8221; or &#8220;secretly gay people become really homophobic&#8221;. So some percent of washed-up gifted kids compensate by really, really hating nerdiness, rationality, and the intellect.</p><p>The variety of self-hating nerd are too many to number. There are the nerds who go into psychology to prove that EQ is a real thing and IQ merely its pale pathetic shadow. There are the nerds who become super-woke and talk about how reason and objectivity are forms of white supremacy culture. There are the nerds who obsess over &#8220;embodiment&#8221; and &#8220;somatic therapy&#8221; and accuse everyone else of &#8220;living in their heads&#8221;. There are the nerds who deflect by becoming really into neurodiversity - &#8220;the interesting thing about my brain isn&#8217;t that I&#8217;m &#8216;smart&#8217; or &#8216;rational&#8217;, it&#8217;s that I&#8217;m ADHDtistic, which is actually a weakness . . . but also secretly a strength!&#8221; There are the nerds who flirt with fascism because it idolizes men of action, and the nerds who convert to Christianity because it idolizes men of faith. There are the nerds who get really into Seeing Like A State, and how being into rationality and metrics and numbers is <em>soooooo</em> High Modernist, but as a Kegan Level Five Avatar they are far beyond such petty concerns. There are the nerds who redefine &#8220;nerd&#8221; as &#8220;person who likes Marvel movies&#8221; - having successfully gerrymandered themselves outside the category, they can go back to their impeccably-accurate statisticsblogging on educational outcomes, or their deep dives into anthropology and medieval mysticism, all while casting about them imprecations that of course <em>nerds</em> are loathsome scum who deserve to be bullied.</p><p>(maybe it&#8217;s unfair to attribute this to self-hatred <em>per se. </em>Adams wrote, not unfairly, that the scientismists in Kegan level 4 &#8220;are arrogant when it comes to dealing with people in levels two and three.&#8221; Maybe there&#8217;s the same desperate urge for level 5 to differentiate themselves from 4s - cf. <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/22/right-is-the-new-left/\">barberpole theory of fashion</a>).</p><p>Scott Adams felt the contradictions of nerd-dom more acutely than most. As compensation, he was gifted with two great defense mechanisms. The first was humor (which Freud grouped among the mature, adaptive defenses), aided by its handmaiden self-awareness. The second (from Freud&#8217;s &#8220;neurotic&#8221; category) was his own particular variety of reaction formation, &#8220;I&#8217;m better than those other nerds because, while they foolishly worship rationality and the intellect, I&#8217;ve gotten past it to the real deal, marketing / manipulation / persuasion / hypnosis.&#8221; </p><p>When he was young, and his mind supple, he was able to balance both these mechanisms; the steam of their dissonance drove the turbine of his art. As he grew older, the first one - especially the self-awareness - started to fail, and he leaned increasingly heavily on the second. Forced to bear the entire weight of his wounded psyche, it started showing more and more cracks, until eventually he ended up as a podcaster - the surest sign of a deranged mind. </p><p>In comparison, his final downfall was almost trivial -  a bog-standard cancellation, indistinguishable from every other cancellation of the 2015 - 2025 period. Angered by a poll where some black people expressed discomfort with the slogan &#8220;It&#8217;s Okay To Be White&#8221;, Adams declared that &#8220;the best advice I would give to white people is to get the hell away from black people; just get the fuck away&#8221;. Needless to say, his publisher, syndicator, and basically every newspaper in the country dropped him immediately. He relaunched his comics on Locals, an online subscription platform for cancelled people, but his reach had declined by two orders of magnitude and never recovered.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KXGn!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bc5ae27-2f25-4b70-bd92-bcba7e6bce03_785x253.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"223.02675159235667\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KXGn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bc5ae27-2f25-4b70-bd92-bcba7e6bce03_785x253.png\" width=\"692\" /><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Adams was willing to sacrifice everything for the right to say &#8220;It&#8217;s Okay To Be White&#8221;.

You&#8217;re a bald guy with glasses named Scott A who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. You think you&#8217;re pretty clever, but the world has a way of reminding you of your limitations. You try to work a normal job. You do a little funny writing on the side. People like the funny writing more than you expected. Hardly believing your luck, you quit to do the funny writing full time. You explore themes about the irrationality of the world. You have some crazy ideas you&#8217;re not entirely willing to stand behind, and present them as fiction or speculation or April Fools jokes. You always wonder whether your purpose in life is <em>really</em> just funny writing - not because people don&#8217;t love the stuff you write, not even because you don&#8217;t get fan mail saying you somehow mysteriously changed people&#8217;s lives, but just because it seems less serious than being a titan of industry or something. You try some other things. They don&#8217;t go terribly, but they don&#8217;t go great either. You decide to stick with what you&#8217;re good at. You write a book about the Lurianic kabbalah. You get really into whale puns.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!G4bN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe506216-3992-44f0-bd00-72ff3a5d8a55_318x338.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"Shave the Whales (Dilbert #4) by Scott Adams | Goodreads\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"416.65408805031444\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!G4bN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe506216-3992-44f0-bd00-72ff3a5d8a55_318x338.jpeg\" title=\"Shave the Whales (Dilbert #4) by Scott Adams | Goodreads\" width=\"392\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>As we pass through life, sometimes God shows us dopplegangers, bright or dark mirrors of ourselves, glimpses of how we might turn out if we zig or zag on the path ahead. Some of these people are meant as shining inspirations, others as terrible warnings, but they&#8217;re all our teachers. </p><p>Adams was my teacher in a more literal way too. He published several annotated collections, books where he would present comics along with an explanation of exactly what he was doing in each place, why some things were funny and others weren&#8217;t, and how you could one day be as funny as him. Ten year old Scott devoured these. I&#8217;ve always tried to hide my power level as a humorist, lest I get pegged as a comedic author and people stop taking me seriously.

Elisha was an evil apostate. His former student, Rabbi Meir, who stayed good and orthodox, insisted that Rabbi Elisha probably went to Heaven. This was never very plausible, and God sent increasingly obvious signs to the contrary, including a booming voice from Heaven saying that Elisha was not saved. Out of loyalty to his ex-teacher, Meir dismissed them all - that voice was probably just some kind of 4D chess move - and insisted that Elisha had a share in the World To Come. </p><p>Out of the same doomed loyalty as Rabbi Meir, I want to believe Scott Adams went to Heaven. </p><p>There is what at first appears to be promising evidence - in <a href=\"https://x.com/ScottAdamsSays/status/2011116140626657458\">his final message to his fans</a>, Adams said:</p><blockquote><p>Many Christian friends have asked me to find Jesus before I go. I&#8217;m not a believer, but I have to admit the risk-reward calculation for doing so looks attractive. So here I go: I accept Jesus Christ as my lord and savior, and I like forward to spending an eternity with him. The part about me not being a believer should be quickly resolved if I wake up in heaven. I won&#8217;t need any more convincing than that. And I hope I am still qualified for entry.</p></blockquote><p>It is a dogma of many religions that sincere deathbed conversions are accepted. But I&#8217;d be more comfortable if this sounded less like &#8220;haha, I found my final clever lifehack&#8221;. I can only hope he didn&#8217;t try to implant any hypnotic suggestions in an attempt to get a linguistic kill shot in on the Almighty. As another self-hating nerd writer put it, &#8220;through all these years I make experiment if my sins or Your mercy greater be.&#8221;</p><p>But I&#8217;m more encouraged by the second half of his departing note:</p><blockquote><p>For the first part of my life, I was focused on making myself a worthy husband and parent, as a way to find meaning. That worked. But marriages don't always last forever, and mine eventually ended, in a highly amicable way. I'm grateful for those years and for the people I came to call my family.<br /><br />Once the marriage unwound, I needed a new focus. A new meaning. And so I donated myself to \"the world,\" literally speaking the words out loud in my otherwise silent home. From that point on, I looked for ways I could add the most to people's lives, one way or another.<br /><br />That marked the start of my evolution from Dilbert cartoonist to an author of - what I hoped would be - useful books. By then, I believed I had condensed enough life lessons that I could start passing them on. I continued making Dilbert comics, of course.<br /><br />As luck would have it, I'm a good writer. My first book in the \"useful\" genre was How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big. That book turned out to be a huge success, often imitated, and influencing a wide variety of people. I still hear every day how much that book changed lives. My plan to be useful was working.<br /><br />I followed up with my book Win Bigly, that trained an army of citizens how to be more persuasive, which they correctly saw as a minor super power. I know that book changed lives because I hear it often.<br /><br />You'll probably never know the impact the book had on the world, but I know, and it pleases me while giving me a sense of meaning that is impossible to describe.<br /><br />My next book, Loserthink, tried to teach people how to think better, especially if they were displaying their thinking on social media. That one didn't put much of a dent in the universe, but I tried.<br /><br />Finally, my book Reframe Your Brain taught readers how to program their own thoughts to make their personal and professional lives better. I was surprised and delighted at how much positive impact that book is having.<br /><br />I also started podcasting a live show called Coffee With Scott Adams, dedicated to helping people think about the world, and their lives, in a more productive way. I didn't plan it this way, but it ended up helping lots of lonely people find a community that made them feel less lonely. Again, that had great meaning for me.<br /><br />I had an amazing life. I gave it everything I had. If you got any benefits from my work, I'm asking you to pay it forward as best you can. That is the legacy I want.</p><p>Be useful.</p><p>And please know I loved you all to the end.</p></blockquote><p>I had been vaguely aware that he had some community around him, but on the event of his death, I tried watching an episode or two of his show. I couldn&#8217;t entirely follow, but I think his various sub-shows are getting rolled into a broader brand, <em>The Scott Adams School</em>, where his acolytes discuss and teach his theory of persuasion:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://x.com/ScottAdamsSays/status/2011091094113828959\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"461.0878378378378\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gvKE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3012b173-16db-4ce2-aa34-afb82a77b09b_592x529.png\" width=\"516\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The woman on the top left is his ex-wife.

Some watch every episode of his podcast and consider him a genius. Others were touched in more subtle ways. People who wrote him with their problems and he responded. People who met him on the street and demanded the typical famous person &#8220;pose for a photo with me&#8221;, and he did so graciously. People who said his self-help books really helped them.

That\u2019s what takes this from \u2018deeply foolish and greedy idea that will backfire\u2019 to \u2018intentionally trying to blow everything up to watch it burn.\u2019</p>\n<p>Garry Tan points out that <a href=\"https://x.com/garrytan/status/2009776299666223265\">as written the law would treat any supervoting shares</a> as if they had economic value equal to their voting rights, which means any founders with such shares are effectively banned from the state. There are some other interesting cases, most notably Mark Zuckerberg.</p>\n<p>Garry Tan is one of those with a history of crying wolf, but in this case? Wolf.</p>\n<p>This one is really scary. <a href=\"https://polymarket.com/event/billionaire-one-time-wealth-tax-passes-in-california-election-2026/billionaire-one-time-wealth-tax-passes-in-california-election-2026\">Chances of this passing are up to 53%</a>, and the \u2018<a href=\"https://polymarket.com/event/billionaire-one-time-wealth-tax-on-california-ballot\">will this be on the ballet\u2019 question is only at 61%</a>, which implies that if this does make it to a vote then it will probably pass. Again, California needs to end propositions, period.</p>\n<p>I presume that, if implemented, this would force the entire startup ecosystem, and likely all of tech, to flee the state. California is nice, but it\u2019s not this nice.</p>\n<p>They were forced to do this, <a href=\"https://x.com/asymmetricinfo/status/2010057934856941656\">since the proposal backdates the tax</a>. Once you open that door, it\u2019s time to leave. Even if this proposal fails, what about the next proposal? Or will everyone act like they do with AI risks, and say \u2018well things are fine so far\u2019 and put their heads back into the sand?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/2010040951142748541\">In a sane world this would be the death of California\u2019s ballot proposal system.</a></p>\n<p>The audacity of the lies around this one stood out to several who don\u2019t say \u2018lying\u2019 lightly lighting.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/KelseyTuoc/status/2011143532724306130\">Kelsey Piper</a>: When I said this tax was a terrible idea a bunch of people smugly flocked to tell me how, since it was retroactive, there\u2019d be no risk of billionaires moving to avoid it. But instead what this means is that the billionaires move even before we know whether it makes the ballot!</p>\n<p>I remember people telling me that there was not typically very much capital flight in response to a modest increase in income tax rates and therefore we could be sure that there wouldn\u2019t be any from a much much larger and less precedented tax.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s this specific kind of lying that is endemic on the policy left, where you make absolutely insane and obviously false claims but ground them by linking a paper to a very different situation where no one was able to detect much of an effect.</p>\n<p>The lying on the right is a huge problem and I would say much worse, though usually slightly different in character. They just make stuff up, while libs will do the \u2018link a study that doesn\u2019t say that\u2019 thing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/patio11/status/2011174147431285121\">Patrick McKenzie</a>: One is welcome to remember this for the next round of this game, since advocates certainly will not.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut were they lying to us in the current round?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yes, obviously. YMMV on whether that should cost them points with you and yours.</p>\n<p>Myself I favor an epistemic stance like \u201cIf one inadvertently says an untrue thing which is core to one\u2019s argument one, on learning it was untrue, admits that and accepts a modest amount of egg on face. Orgs which do not embrace protocol get performance to contract, not trust.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPatrick you used the word \u2018lying.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>I did.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do not frequently deploy the word \u2018lying.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u2026 \u201cWould you ever countenance a lie?\u201d</p>\n<p>I do like the formulation that a Catholic priest relayed to me when I was approximately seven: \u201cLies which offend God are sins.

It is hard to come up with an alternative hypothesis on the nature of this prosecution.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/SenThomTillis/status/2010514786467959269\">Senator Thom Tillis pledges to oppose the confirmation</a> of all Fed nominees while this matter is pending. He serves on the Banking Committee, which is currently split 13-11. If no one is confirmed, then Powell would remain chair.</p>\n<p>This means that not, unless you can come up with another explanation for why you would attempt to prosecute Jerome Powell over (checks notes) statements to Congress regarding a building renovation, only is Donald Trump trying to destroy the independence of the Federal Reserve, he is very clearly trumping up charges against those he thinks are standing in his way, as per his explicit other communications.</p>\n<p>For those who need a reminder, if you cap credit card interest rates at 10%, that forces banks to severely restrict credit card access and make up that revenue in other ways, many consumers will be forced to use alternative mechanisms that often charge more, and we should expect consumers as a group to be a lot worse off. Don\u2019t do this.</p>\n<p>The UK sends one soldier to defend Greenland.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u200bBarbara Tuchman (<a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/1329368/full_content\">from The Guns of August, this is in 1910</a>):</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is the smallest British military force that would be of any practical assistance to you?\u201d Wilson asked.</p>\n<p>Like a rapier flash came Foch\u2019s reply, \u201cA single British soldier\u2014and we will see to it that he is killed.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/2011055101499015266\">Also</a>, in terms of banning institutional ownership of homes, institutions own maybe 1% of single family homes, institutions of any size only hold 7%, the three institutions named as owning \u2018everything\u2019 by RFK Jr. in this context don\u2019t directly own them at all (they own some interest in homes via REITs) and most definitely do not want to \u2018own every single family home in our country.\u2019 Banning institutions from owning such homes will make it harder to build or rent houses and it will generally make things worse.</p>\n<p>If you are trying to figure out whether you should be happy \u2018as a utilitarian\u2019 with the United States taking out the de facto leader of Venezuela, <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2026/01/u-s-interventions-in-the-new-world-with-leader-removal.html\">contra Tyler Cowen you cannot only ask the question of whether interventions in this reference class</a> lead to superior results in that particular country. The obvious first thing is you don\u2019t know that you can expect results similar to the reference class, and the second is that counterfactuals are, as Tyler admits, very difficult to assess.</p>\n<p>Even setting all that aside, this is the wrong question. You cannot only ask \u2018does this improve the likely outcome for Venezuela?\u2019 which requires considering the details of the situation and path chosen. You instead have to consider whether the decision algorithm that leads to such a removal leads to a better world overall, or at least you must consider the impact of this decision on all actors worldwide.</p>\n<p>What Tyler Cowen is doing here is exactly the type of direct-consequence under-considered act utilitarianism that leads to problems like Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2026/01/the-venezuelan-stock-market.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-venezuelan-stock-market\">So when Tyler asks \u2018effective altruists, are you paying attention?</a>\u2019 to the fact that the direct consequences seem to Tyler to be positive, is he saying \u2018you should be doing or trying to induce more immoral unconstitutional actions that are good on a direct outcome act utilitarian basis\u2019 or is he (one might hope) saying \u2018notice that you need to have virtue ethics or deontology, you make this kind of mistake all the time\u2019? Or is he trying to make an \u2018EA case for Trump\u2019 of some kind or simply score points in some sense? I honestly can\u2019t tell.</p>\n<p>But no, I say, if you think this was an immoral unconstitutional action, the you should not approve of it, for that reason alone. That seems pretty simple to me. I certainly hope no one is making the case that taking immoral unconstitutional actions are a good idea so long as they produce a particular outcome that you like?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/sethbannon/status/1998982891976671426\">US government is planning</a> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/foreign-tourists-five-years-social-media-history-customs-border-protec-rcna248337\">to require tourists from over 40 countries to hand over</a> 5 years of social media history, all email addresses and phone numbers used in the last 5 years, and the names and addresses of family members.

This is better than buying an ETF or other index fund that doesn\u2019t follow that rule.</p>\n<p>A lot of the reason I choose to buy individual stocks is the generalization of this. Even if I can\u2019t \u2018pick winners\u2019 I trust myself to do better than random at identifying losers you don\u2019t want to touch and then not touching them. Profitably shorting is hard, profitably \u2018not longing\u2019 doesn\u2019t scale but is a lot easier and you\u2019re still kind of short.</p>\n<p>This also suggests a business opportunity. Why not create an ETF that is the broad US stock market, except it excludes hard-to-borrow stocks beyond some low threshold? If a stock becomes hard-to-borrow, it sells that stock until it becomes easy again. You would expect to consistently outperform. There wouldn\u2019t be a strict index to follow, so it requires solving some issues, but seems worth it.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">No All That Money Doesn\u2019t Go To Pay Interest</h4>\n\n\n<p>This is a bad presentation of information and everyone involved should feel bad.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Senator <a href=\"https://x.com/BasedMikeLee/status/1996274940669202899\">Mike Lee</a> (R-Utah): Nearly a quarter of every tax dollar the federal government takes from you is now used just to pay *interest* on the national debt</p>\n<p>This will get worse as long as Congress pretends money is limitless\u2014as it does when spending roughly $2 trillion more than it brings in each year</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LMjT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa88df3b1-77de-4041-a446-2475f01325c2_723x460.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Should Congress cut down on spending? I believe they should, because we could be on the verge of the market charging a lot higher interest on government debt, and it is very important to reduce the risk of that happening.</p>\n<p>Does this mean 25% of your tax dollar goes to interest? Absolutely not. That is not where the \u2018money goes,\u2019 even accepting that money is fully fungible.</p>\n<p>The correct way to think about this is that what you care about is the ratio of debt-to-GDP, therefore:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There is a primary deficit, ignoring interest. It\u2019s too big. We should fix it.</li>\n<li>There is interest on the debt, and there is nominal economic growth.</li>\n<li>To the extent that the interest on the debt exceeds the rate of nominal economic growth, the outstanding debt is getting worse over time over and above the primary deficit.</li>\n<li>To the extent the interest is less than nominal economic growth, it is shrinking over time, counteracting some of the primary deficit.</li>\n<li>If nominal growth sufficiently exceeded interest rates, say due to AI, in a sustained way, then we could handle any amount of debt that didn\u2019t raise that interest rate.</li>\n<li>The reason you still make sure you don\u2019t go into too much debt eventually does raise the interest rate you pay, and can hit tipping points.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Household-to-government metaphors are often used in such spots. They can be misleading, but can also be good intuition pumps.</p>\n<p>Right now:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Nominal GDP growth is about 4.6%.</li>\n<li>The average interest rate on federal debt is 3.4%, since rates used to be lower.</li>\n<li>If we refinanced all outstanding federal debt, at its original durations, using current interest rates, we would pay roughly 3.9%.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thus, right now, not only is 25% of your tax dollar not paying interest on the debt, the de facto amount you pay is negative. If we balanced the primary budget, the debt would shrink over time as a percentage of GDP.</p>\n<p>Our primary deficit is very high, and this means the deficit continues to expand as a share of GDP, perhaps dangerously high. But the interest burden, for now, is fine.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">While I Cannot Condone This</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-vibecession\">Scott Alexander gives us highlights on the comments from his vibecession post</a>. My response to quite a lot of this is \u2018see The <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/the-revolution-of-rising-expectations\">Revolution of Rising Expectations</a> sequence,\u2019 and I am sad that he didn\u2019t incorporate that into his updates here. A lot of people are clearly grasping at similar things.</p>\n<p>I was especially disappointed by Scott\u2019s continued emphasis on the math behind things like \u2018real wages\u2019 or inflation, whereas I spent a lot of the sequence emphasizing that this misses the measurement that matters most.</p>\n<p>One point highlighted here is the Parable of Calvin\u2019s Grandparents, where his grandfather worked terrible hours doing unpleasant work owning his own business, and pretty much never did anything besides work and never saw his kids aside from attending church. If you want to run a thankless small business (one person mentions a butcher) my understanding is you can absolutely make a solid living that way, it\u2019s just not going to be fun and we don\u2019t want to do that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2026/01/03/sports-betting-addiction-recovery-center/\">A look at a \u2018sober house\u2019 for sports bettors</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/deanwball/status/2008550608337547538\">A good question</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dean Ball: \u200bI really wonder how many uber black drivers in dc nyc and sf are intelligence assets.

Too much time always-on without breaks.</li>\n<li>Broken steering. Your actions seem to not accomplish anything or not matter.</li>\n<li>Mission doubt. You don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re doing this.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/burnout-is-breaking-a-sacred-pact?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true\">Cate Hall offers some additional items</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Shifting goals, or empathy, pulling in too many directions in a row or at once.</li>\n<li>Emergencies that aren\u2019t genuine, due to poor leadership or time management.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As Shear emphasizes, this is not about working too hard. You don\u2019t get burnout from \u2018working too hard,\u2019 you get it from specific mismatches.</p>\n<p>As Hall emphasizes, once you sense oncoming burnout, the sooner you deal with it and treat it like an emergency the better, whereas if you try to power through it will only get worse, and you\u2019ll lose more time in recovery and risk a larger sphere of aversion afterwards. In some cases, if you wait too long, you might never recover or it might become universal. And it isn\u2019t stress.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve certainly known burnout. I\u2019ve burned out in a big way three times, once from Magic: The Gathering from repetition and mission doubt, once after MetaMed from basically all of it, once at the end of Jane Street due to a form of permanent on-call. I\u2019ve also \u2018locally\u2019 burned out plenty of times, and back during my Magic career I\u2019d sometimes burn out on testing a format or matchup or within a tournament. I notice that I can be short term burned out on \u2018effort posting\u2019 at times but am basically never burned out from general posting, and that when it\u2019s an issue \u2018don\u2019t do any writing\u2019 isn\u2019t the way to fix the problem.</p>\n<p>I notice that burnout is fractal in time.

As in, Polymarket is returning to the United States.</p>\n<p>Many are attempting to block Polymarket by complaining that it allows insider trading, and this is \u2018deceptive.\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/its-your-job-to-keep-your-secrets?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=1245641&amp;post_id=184029368&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=67wny&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email\">Robin Hanson points out that it\u2019s on you to keep your secrets</a>, and there is nothing deceptive about trading on info. I agree, so long as it is clear that insider trading is permitted. Insider information is deceptive if and only if the traders are being told that there won\u2019t be insider trading. That promise is valuable, but so is getting insider information. There is room for both market types.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/mantic-monday-the-monkeys-paw-curls?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=89120&amp;post_id=184065379&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=67wny&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email\">Scott Alexander points out we now have lots of liquid prediction markets</a> on non-sports events, via Polymarket and Kalshi, yet the world hasn\u2019t changed much. He asks why, and offers several partial explanations.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There\u2019s definitely a lot of \u2018people have not caught on yet,\u2019 also known as a pure diffusion problem. In some narrow cases, like elections, the odds are being accepted and mainstreamed the way they are in sports, but it\u2019s a slow process.</li>\n<li>As in AI, the fact that the future is unevenly distributed does not mean it isn\u2019t here. Yes, prediction markets matter, and have definitely informed my actions.</li>\n<li>I agree that for many purposes, 20% and 40% are often \u2018the same number,\u2019 and people are notoriously bad about tracking and learning from changes in probabilities (see the stock market), so prediction markets aren\u2019t having that much impact on decisions unless we previously had very large uncertainty.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, people often simply do not care about the odds when making decisions. This is the Han Solo Rule: Never tell me the odds.</li>\n<li>I think the big one is that Polymarket hasn\u2019t asked enough of the right questions. This is a structural and cost issue, combined with a grading criteria issue, not a failure of imagination. Markets that are long term, or conditional, or potentially ambiguous, or worse a combination of all three, are very hard to make work.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The good news is that these problems, especially #5, become less binding as volume goes up and there are more profit centers to subsidize esoteric markets, but it\u2019s a slow process.</p>\n<p>Scott Alexander offers a Hanson-like proposal for a set of conditional markets to control for various factors, allowing us to make causally dependent conditional markets. Something like that would work, but it requires 4+ markets all of which are conditional and liquid. That means either vastly more interest in such markets (and solving the capital lock-up issues), or it means massive subsidies.</p>\n<p>On the question of grading criteria, for my own markets I\u2019m moving towards \u2018use the best definition you can and then say you\u2019ll resolve via LLM\u2019 since that is objective in its own way, although I am not yet being consistent about this. But when I see obvious ambiguous cases? Yep, then I\u2019m going to take the cowards way out in advance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2026/01/the-tyranny-of-the-complainers.html\">Most complaints come from a very small number of people</a>, often a majority come from one person. The classic example cited is noise complaints against airports, but this extends to things like sex discrimination, where one person is 10%-30% of all complaints. Alas, with AI, it is increasingly possible for a complainer to be outrageously \u2018productive\u2019 if they choose this. <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/levels-of-friction\">Levels of Friction</a> on scaling your complaints are dangerously low.</p>\n<p>The obvious solution is you do at least one of these and ideally both:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You make it expensive to keep doing this, or impose a quota.</li>\n<li>You stop listening.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That\u2019s what we do in \u2018normal life\u2019 when someone complains a ton and they don\u2019t check out. Once we decide their complaints don\u2019t have merit, we ignore them, and we socially punish them if they don\u2019t stop.</p>\n<p>Important thing to remember from Vitalik here:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/LockFryer/status/1998351014466826315\">Nathan Young</a>: I have no time for criticism of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality that doesn\u2019t acknowledge it\u2019s one of the most read Harry Potter fan fictions in the world.

I\u2019m not quite sure what this film is about, as I was so busy being astonished by the cinematography that I missed many of the subtitles. (Oddly, the audience for this Chinese language film was mostly white, in one of America\u2019s most Chinese counties.) Bi Gan seems to have been influenced by everything from M\u00e9li\u00e8s\u2019 silent film to Joseph Cornell\u2019s magic boxes to Hou Hsiao-hsien\u2019s <em>Three Times</em>. It\u2019s so gratifying to see a director give us something new. This might end up being my favorite film of the decade. A shout out to cinematographer Dong Jingsong, who also filmed <em>Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night</em>.</p>\n<p>The 30-minute long take at night in a rundown Yangtze river town reminded me of when my wife and I visited Wanxian one evening back in 1994. It was a surreal experience as the city would soon be flooded by the Three Gorges Dam and the place seemed like a decaying cyberpunk stage set.\u200b</p></blockquote>\n<p>or simply, later:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u200bI tend to prefer East Asian cinema over Western films because the focus is more on visual style, rather than intellectual ideas.</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u2018I gave this film a perfect score without knowing what it was about\u2019 is not a thought that would enter my mind. I didn\u2019t doubt, reading that, that the cinematography was exceptional but I noticed that I expected the movie to bore me if I saw it. But then Tyler Cowen also praised it, and Claude noticed it was playing a short walk away.</p>\n<p>So I saw Resurrection, and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/thezvi/film/resurrection-2025/\">actually, yes, it\u2019s the best film of 2025, and I wrote this</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Scott Sumner said he wasn\u2019t quite sure what this film was about and still called it potentially his favorite film of the decade. I didn\u2019t understand how both could be true at once. Now I do.</p>\n<p>In terms of Sumner\u2019s preferences, cinematic Quality, especially cinematography and visual style, I think this is the best film I\u2019ve ever seen, period. As purely a series of stunning shots and images, even if it hadn\u2019t come together at all, this would already be worthwhile. Which is something I basically never say, so it\u2019s saying a lot, although maybe I can learn. It\u2019s good to appreciate things.</p>\n<p>And yes, the whole thing is on its surface rather confusing in terms of what it is actually about until it clicks into place, although you can have a pretty good hunch rather quickly.</p>\n<p>Then most of the pieces did come together on two levels, including the title, with notably rare exceptions where I assume either I\u2019d get it on second viewing or I lack the historical or cultural context. And this became great.</p>\n<p>She says you don\u2019t even know her name. I think you do know.</p>\n<p>I do think to work fully this needs to be in a theater, it\u2019s very visual and you need to be free of distractions.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The more I reflect on the experience, I agree with Tyler Cowen that seeing it in a theater really is a must. The more you are going for cinematography and Quality, the more you need a theater, and I think this applies even more than it does to the big blockbuster special effects movies.</p>\n<p>If I had no idea what this film was about, or thought the thing it was trying to say was dumb, where would I put it on the cinematography and quality alone? On reflection I think I\u2019d rate that experience around a 4 out of 5. I will add that yes, it is in part a love letter to film, that\u2019s obvious and not a spoiler, but it is another thing, too.</p>\n<p>Sumner also reviewed two movies I\u2019ve seen recently, Sentimental Value (3.8) and One Battle After Another (3.7). I don\u2019t have either movie that high, but neither score surprised me, and both seem right given what he values.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/11/best-movies-of-2025.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=best-movies-of-2025\">Tyler Cowen picks the movies he liked in 2025</a> without naming any he finds great in particular.

There\u2019s a clear pattern of choosing \u2018this movie had very good direction\u2019 as the central criteria. Makes sense.

I would say far too high, that this is letting Quality override other movie features and this is a mistake.</p>\n<p>Variance in such lists is also very high. Almost every list will have something that seems like a mistake, and include many movies I have not seen.</p>\n<p>There really are a lot of movies. As of writing this I\u2019ve seen 55 new movies in 2025, and even with some attempt to see the best movies (and admittedly some cases where I wasn\u2019t trying) that still doesn\u2019t include that many of the movies these lists include.</p>\n<p>Thus, there are four types of disagreements with such lists.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I haven\u2019t seen the movie. Maybe you\u2019re right.</li>\n<li>I have seen the movie, I disagree with you, but I get it. If you think One Battle After Another or Sinners or Weapons was great, I get why you would think that, in that order. They ooze \u2018this is a really good movie\u2019 but didn\u2019t work for me.</li>\n<li>I have seen the movie, I disagree with you, and you\u2019re wrong. Two lists had The Phoenician Scheme, and I\u2019m sorry, no, there\u2019s some great moments and acting in it but overall it\u2019s not there and you have to know that.</li>\n<li>You\u2019re missing a movie that you can\u2019t have missed, and this isn\u2019t merely a matter of taste, it both oozes great movie and is actually great, so you\u2019re simply wrong, then this subdivides into \u2018the world is wrong\u2019 and \u2018no it\u2019s just you that\u2019s wrong.\u2019</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/talking-myself-into-a-netflix-warner\">Matthew Yglesias talks himself into the Netflix-Warner merger.</a> He points out that many IPs might transfer from primarily movie IP to primarily TV show IP, and my response to that is: Good. TV lasts longer and has a bigger payoff, and movies rely too much on existing IP. It\u2019s only bad if Netflix-Warner actively means theaters go out of business, which would indeed be terrible.</p>\n<p>The movie business is weird. I don\u2019t understand why, here in New York, you have tons of movie theaters and they all play the same new movies all the time for brief windows, and old movies only get brought back for particular events. Shouldn\u2019t the long tail work in your favor here, especially since the economics of that favor the theater (they keep a much bigger cut)?

He is entirely correct. The killer product is that you take cameras, you let a fan sit in a great seat, and let them watch the game from that seat. That\u2019s it. Never force a camera move on the viewer. That\u2019s actively better than doing more traditional things.</p>\n<p>You can improve that experience by giving the fan the option to move seats if desired, and giving them the option for a radio-style broadcast, and perhaps options for superimposing various statistics and game state information on their screens. But keep it simple.</p>\n<p>If you miss MTV, <a href=\"https://wantmymtv.vercel.app/\">there\u2019s MTV Rewind</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gamers Gonna Game Game Game Game Game</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/OndrejStrasky/status/2003125129853714523\">Ondrej Strasky report on the Arena Championship,</a> where he played Necro reanimator in Timeless.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sports Go Sports</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/LevAkabas/status/1998787916055851321\">Two point attempts in the NBA now pay off better than three point attempts</a>.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WLru!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca9e3682-3025-4381-bea2-044dfa65174e_1200x1198.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>The equilibrium is that 2s should be worth substantially more than 3s. 2s have much higher variance than 3s.

My list had quite a lot of things I am actively not interested in, but I didn\u2019t notice because I never use algorithmic feeds.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/voooooogel/status/2010874610758402352\">Thebes gave us that tip</a>, along with using lists for small accounts you like and aggressively and repeatedly saying \u2018not interested\u2019 in any and all viral posts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/BenjaminDEKR/status/2010103870634987850\">Elon Musk is threatening to turn the Twitter algorithm over to Grok again</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/BenjaminDEKR/status/2010103870634987850\">Benjamin De Kraker</a>: Ok, but where does \u201cpeople you follow\u201d fit into this process?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/cb_doge/status/2010101570525114521\">DogeDesigner</a>: Elon Musk explains how the new Grok powered \ud835\udd4f algorithm will work:</p>\n<p>\u2022 Grok will read every post made on \ud835\udd4f i.e over 100M posts daily.</p>\n<p>\u2022 After filtering, it will match content to 300M to 400M users daily.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Goal is to show each user content they are most likely to enjoy or engage with.</p>\n<p>\u2022 It will filter out spam and scam content automatically.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Helps fix the small or new account problem where good posts go unseen.</p>\n<p>\u2022 You will be able to ask Grok to adjust your feed, temporarily or permanently.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So there it is. Direct engagement maximization on a per-post basis, and except for asking Grok to adjust your feed it will completely ignore anything else, and especially will not care about who you follow.</p>\n<p>Elon Musk promises they will open source the algorithm periodically. At this point we all know how much that promise is worth.</p>\n<p>If you want a social network to succeed in the long term you need to, <a href=\"https://x.com/tszzl/status/1811891429897281815\">as per Roon here</a>, foster the development of organic self-organizing communities, centrally embodied by the concept of Tpot (as in \u2018that part of Twitter\u2019) for various different parts. If you do short term optimization you get slop and everything dies, and indeed even with the aggressive use of lists to avoid the algorithm it is clear Twitter is increasingly dominated by slop strategies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/daniel_271828/status/2002141742821487021\">A fun fact: Meta estimates it is involved in 1/3 of all successful scams in America</a> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAPqErwZzv0&amp;t=1332s\">original video source</a>) and Meta is basically doing the \u2018we are making more money from allowing scams than we will be fined for knowingly allowing the scams\u2019 calculation and knowingly allowing a lot of scams. I wonder how much they valued what would happen when people noticed all the scams? What will happen?</p>\n<p>Robert Wiblin frames this as a \u2018WTF\u2019 moment, <a href=\"https://x.com/danluu/status/2003077485534298349\">Dan Luu does not find it surprising</a> and notes that whenever he tries clicking ads he finds a lot of scams, and notes that big companies have a hard time doing spam and scam filtering because they present too juicy an attack surface. In this case, the WTF comes from Meta clearly having the ability to do much better at preventing scams, seemingly without that many false positives, and choosing not to because the scammers generate ad revenue.</p>\n<p>Elon Musk is once again making Twitter worse. Every time you load the page it will force the For You tab of horrors onto you, forcing you to reclick the Following button, and it may not be long before it is impossible to switch back. On Twitter Pro, you cannot switch back &#8211; the following tab is a For You no matter what you click on.</p>\n<p>Good news, there is a solution, it\u2019s a hack but it works:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/SharpFootball/status/2000928731418775947\">Warren Sharp:</a> tweetdeck\u2019s home column being permanently stuck on the \u201cfor you\u201d option despite selecting the \u201cfollowing\u201d option is a development I wouldn\u2019t wish on my worst enemy.</p>\n<p>\u2026if your home tab is now full of \u201cfor you\u201d recommended posts and you can\u2019t see only people you follow, do this:</p>\n<p>1. hit \u201cadd a new column\u201d<br />\n2. hit the \u201csearch\u201d option<br />\n3. check the box \u201conly show people you follow\u201d<br />\n4. leave the search field blank<br />\n5. hit the search button</p>\n<p>boom</p>\n<p>new column with only people you follow.

As Vitalik notes, Europe, including both the UK and EU, have severe problems, but the rhetoric about them seems rather out of hand on Twitter.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Vitalik Buterin: I think you should consider that making X a global totem pole for Free Speech, and then turning it into a death star laser for coordinated hate sessions, is actually harmful for the cause of free speech. I\u2019m seriously worried that huge backlashes against values I hold dear are coming in a few years\u2019 time.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s clearly actively tweaking algorithms to boost some things and deboost other things based on pretty arbitrary criteria.</p>\n<p>As long as that power lever exists, I\u2019d prefer it be used (without increasing its scope) to boost niceness instead of boosting ragebait.</p></blockquote>\n<p>First best solution is to have Twitter run purely on an algorithm, and Elon Musk can either change the algorithm or use his account like everyone else.</p>\n<p>Second best solution is to use the power for good.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
