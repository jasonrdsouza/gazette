                "<p>Tea is a little-known beverage, consumed for flavor or sometimes for conjectured effects as a stimulant. It\u2019s made by submerging the leaves of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camellia_sinensis\">C. Sinensis</a> in hot water. But <em>how</em> hot should the water be?</p>\n\n<p>To resolve this, I brewed the same tea at four different temperatures, brought them all to a uniform serving temperature, and then had four subjects rate them along four dimensions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"subjects\">Subjects</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Subject A</strong> is an experienced tea drinker, exclusively of black tea w/ lots of milk and sugar.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Subject B</strong> is also an experienced tea drinker, <em>mostly</em> of black tea w/ lots of milk and sugar. In recent years, Subject B has been pressured by Subject D to try other teas. Subject B likes fancy black tea and claims to like fancy oolong, but will not drink green tea.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Subject C</strong> is similar to Subject A.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Subject D</strong> likes <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/bourdieu/#on-abstraction-and-omnivores\">all kinds</a> of tea, derives a large fraction of their joy in life from tea, and is world\u2019s preeminent existential angst + science blogger.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"tea-and-brewing\">Tea and brewing</h2>\n\n<p>For a tea that was as \u201cnormal\u201d as possible, I used pyramidal bags of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PG_Tips\">PG Tips</a> tea (Lipton Teas and Infusions, Trafford Park Rd., Trafford Park, Stretford, Manchester M17 1NH, UK).</p>\n\n<p>I brewed it according to the instructions on the box, by submerging one bag in 250ml of water for 2.5 minutes. I did four brews with water at temperatures ranging from 79\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C (174.2\u00b0F to 212\u00b0F). To keep the temperature roughly constant while brewing, I did it in a Pyrex measuring cup (Corning Inc., 1 Riverfront Plaza, Corning, New York, 14831, USA) sitting in a pan of hot water on the stove.</p>\n\n<p>After brewing, I poured the tea into four identical mugs with the brew temperature written on the bottom with a Sharpie Pro marker (Newell Brands, 5 Concourse Pkwy Atlanta, GA 30328, USA). Readers interested in replicating this experiment may note that those written temperatures still persist on the mugs today, three months later. The cups were dark red, making it impossible to see any difference in the teas.</p>\n\n<p>After brewing, I put all the mugs in a pan of hot water until they converged to 80\u00b0C, so they were <em>served</em> at the same temperature.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"serving\">Serving</h2>\n\n<p>I shuffled the mugs and placed them on a table in a random order. I then asked the subjects to taste from each mug and rate the teas for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\u201cAroma\u201d</li>\n  <li>\u201cFlavor\u201d</li>\n  <li>\u201cStrength\u201d</li>\n  <li>\u201cGoodness\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each rating was to be on a 1-5 scale, with 1=bad and 5=good.</p>\n\n<p>Subjects A, B, and C had no knowledge of how the different teas were brewed. Subject D <em>was</em> aware, but was blinded as to which tea was in which mug.</p>\n\n<p>During taste evaluation, Subjects A and C remorselessly pestered Subject D with questions about how a tea strength can be \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d. Subject D rejected these questions on the grounds that \u201cgood\u201d cannot be meaningfully reduced to other words and urged Subjects A and C to review Wittgenstein\u2019s concept of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Investigations#Meaning_as_use\">meaning as use</a>, etc. Subject B questioned the value of these discussions.</p>\n\n<p>After ratings were complete, I poured tea out of all the cups until 100 ml remained in each, added around 1 gram (1/4 tsp) of sugar, and heated them back up to 80\u00b0C. I then re-shuffled the cups and presented them for a second round of ratings.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"results\">Results</h2>\n\n<p>For a single summary, I somewhat arbitrarily combined the four ratings into a \u201cquality\u201d score, defined as</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 (Quality) = 0.1 \u00d7 (Aroma) + 0.3 \u00d7 (Flavor) + 0.1 \u00d7 (Strength) + 0.5 \u00d7 (Goodness).</p>\n\n<p>Here is the data for Subject A, along with a linear fit for quality as a function of brewing temperature. Broadly speaking, A liked everything, but showed weak evidence of any trend.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/quality_A.pdf\"><img alt=\"subject A\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/quality_A.svg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>And here is the same for Subject B, who apparently hated everything.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/quality_B.pdf\"><img alt=\"subject B\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/quality_B.svg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Here is the same for Subject C, who liked everything, but showed very weak evidence of any trend.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/quality_C.pdf\"><img alt=\"subject C\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/quality_C.svg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>And here is the same for Subject D. This shows extremely strong evidence of a negative trend. But, again, while blinded to the order, this subject was aware of the brewing protocol.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/quality_D.pdf\"><img alt=\"subject D\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/quality_D.svg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Finally, here are the results combining data from all subjects. This shows a mild trend, driven mostly by Subject D.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/quality_all.pdf\"><img alt=\"all subjects\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/quality_all.svg\" /></a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"thoughts\">Thoughts</h2>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>This experiment provides very weak evidence that you might be brewing your tea too hot. Mostly, it just proves that Subject D thinks lower-middle tier black tea tastes better when brewed cooler. I already knew that.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>There are a lot of other dimensions to explore, such as the type of tea, the brew time, the amount of tea, and the serving temperature. I think that ideally, I\u2019d randomize all those dimensions, gather a large sample, and then fit some kind of regression.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Creating dozens of different brews and then serving them all blinded at different serving temperatures sounds like <em>way</em> too much work. Maybe there\u2019s an easier way to go about this? Can someone build me a robot?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>If you thirst to see Subject C\u2019s raw aroma scores or whatever, you can download <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/data.csv\">the data</a> or click on one of the entries in this table:</p>\n\n    <table>\n      <thead>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Subject</th>\n          <th>Aroma</th>\n          <th>Flavor</th>\n          <th>Strength</th>\n          <th>Goodness</th>\n          <th>Quality</th>\n        </tr>\n      </thead>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td>A</td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/aroma_A.pdf\">x</a></td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/flavor_A.pdf\">x</a></td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/strength_A.pdf\">x</a></td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/goodness_A.pdf\">x</a></td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/quality_A.pdf\">x</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>B</td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/aroma_B.pdf\">x</a></td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/flavor_B.pdf\">x</a></td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/strength_B.pdf\">x</a></td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/goodness_B.pdf\">x</a></td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/quality_B.pdf\">x</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>C</td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/aroma_C.pdf\">x</a></td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/flavor_C.pdf\">x</a></td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/strength_C.pdf\">x</a></td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/goodness_C.pdf\">x</a></td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/quality_C.pdf\">x</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>D</td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/aroma_D.pdf\">x</a></td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/flavor_D.pdf\">x</a></td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/strength_D.pdf\">x</a></td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/goodness_D.pdf\">x</a></td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/quality_D.pdf\">x</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>All</td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/aroma_all.pdf\">x</a></td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/flavor_all.pdf\">x</a></td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/strength_all.pdf\">x</a></td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/goodness_all.pdf\">x</a></td>\n          <td><a href=\"https://dynomight.net/img/tea/quality_all.pdf\">x</a></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Subject D was really good at this; why can\u2019t everyone be like Subject D?</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>"

They are made of atoms, not ideologies. A city offers a minimum viable infrastructure stack: food, water, shelter, security, all bundled into one platform, benefiting from dense network effects and economies of scale. An operating system for life.</p><blockquote><p>Cities look to me to be our most characteristic technology. We didn&#8217;t really get interesting as a species until we became able to do cities&#8212;that&#8217;s when it all got really diverse, because you can&#8217;t do cities without a substrate of other technologies. There&#8217;s a mathematics to it &#8212; a city can&#8217;t get over a certain size unless you can grow, gather, and store a certain amount of food in the vicinity. Then you can&#8217;t get any bigger unless you understand how to do sewage. If you don&#8217;t have efficient sewage technology the city gets to a certain size and everybody gets cholera.<br /><em>(William Gibson, <a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6089/the-art-of-fiction-no-211-william-gibson\">Paris Review, Summer 2011</a>)</em></p></blockquote><p>How do cities emerge? Well, Paris and London are river cities. Constantinople sits at the end of the Silk Road. New York is a port. Cities seem to emerge around some stock or flow of resources, like rainforests emerge around precipitation patterns, and life emerges around energy gradients.</p><p>Cities outlive civilizations. You can see this in the oldest cities, like Rome, where layers of civilizations accrue like geological strata.</p><blockquote><p>Cities are like compost heaps&#8212;just layers and layers of stuff. In cities, the past and the present and the future can all be totally adjacent.<br /><em>(William Gibson, <a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6089/the-art-of-fiction-no-211-william-gibson\">2011</a>)</em></p></blockquote><p>How long does a city live? Probably as long as the underlying resources continue to flow.</p><div><hr /></div><blockquote><p>Instead of being automated themselves&#8212;fragmented in task and function&#8212;as had been the tendency under mechanization, men in the electric age move increasingly to involvement in diverse jobs simultaneously, and to the work of learning, and to the programming of computers&#8230; Man the food-gatherer reappears incongruously as information-gatherer. In this role, electronic man is no less a nomad than his paleolithic ancestors.<br /><em>(McLuhan, 1964)</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Understanding Whole Systems<br />Shelter and Land Use<br />Industry and Craft<br />Communications<br />Community<br />Nomadics<br />Learning<br /><em>(Table of Contents, <a href=\"https://wholeearth.info/p/whole-earth-catalog-fall-1968\">The Whole Earth Catalog</a>, 1968)</em></p></blockquote><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" href=\"https://www.willemdehaan.be/highrise-campsite.html\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b899c32-6380-4477-95d5-ac27df3a09d4_1080x1152.webp\" title=\"\" width=\"1080\" /><div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Willem De Haan, 2023. <a href=\"https://www.willemdehaan.be/highrise-campsite.html\">High Rise Campsite</a>.</figcaption></figure></div><p><a href=\"https://newsletter.squishy.computer/i/97993210/llms-work-us-over-completely\">Every technology retrieves something from the past</a>. McLuhan posits that networks retrieve nomadics.</p><p>And indeed, a lot of technological innovation seems directionally aligned with networked nomadism. The energy transition is pushing us to <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262545044/electrify/\">electrify everything</a>. Solar panels and lithium batteries allow for cheap decentralized power generation. Software drives miniaturization and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeralization\">ephemeralization</a> in many areas.</p><blockquote><p>The really big theme I&#8217;d like to emphasize&#8230; is the importance of being able to substitute a control system&#8212;sensors and computers&#8212;for actual materials. We are actually now replacing atoms with bits.<br /><em>(Saul Griffith, Otherlab. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMowPAJwqo&amp;t=12m35s\">Soft not Solid @ O&#8217;Reilly</a>)</em></p></blockquote><p>The upshot is that you can construct a pretty viable nomadic stack today for a few thousand bucks: solar panel, battery, Starlink, induction stovetop, pressure cooker, laptop&#8230;</p><div class=\"bluesky-wrap outer\" style=\"height: auto; display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\"></div><p>There are already more than 40 million digital nomads worldwide today. We should expect that number to increase, both due to networks, and to climate migration.</p><p>Industrialization demanded specialization and fixed roles for working with special-purpose machines. By contrast, electricity, automation, computing, are all general-purpose technologies. Computer-driven tools like CNC routers, 3D printers, and robotic arms can be programmed for an open-ended range of tasks on the fly. McLuhan sees networks pushing more and more of production into this software-defined direction. You get the picture he envisions something like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_out_(manufacturing)\">dark factories</a>.</p><p>So, AI and automation increasingly absorb the scalable aspects of production. That leaves us to putty over the cracks. &#8220;Work&#8221; takes on a DIY/<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad\">jugaad</a> quality, focused on creatively hacking together powerful resources to solve contextual problems.</p><p>You have access to a pocket supercomputer, hundreds of AI agents, and <a href=\"https://www.wikipedia.org/\">The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy</a>. What can you do with that?</p><blockquote><p>We are suddenly threatened with a liberation that taxes our inner resources of self-employment and imaginative participation in society. This would seem to be a fate that calls men to the role of artist in society.<br /><em>(McLuhan, 1964)</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A realm of intimate, personal power is developing&#8212;power of the individual to conduct his own education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment, and share his adventure with whoever is interested.<br /><em>(Introduction to <a href=\"https://wholeearth.info/p/whole-earth-catalog-spring-1969\">The Whole Earth Catalog, Spring 1969</a>)</em></p></blockquote><p>Maybe <a href=\"https://wholeearth.info/\">The Whole Earth Catalog</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-to-the-land_movement\">1960&#8217;s back to the land movement</a> weren&#8217;t wrong, just early?
