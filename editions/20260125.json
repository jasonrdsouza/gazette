In the old world, you had to guess the winner in a conference room. In the new world, you build three divergent approaches simultaneously and let the results decide. The cost of debating the work becomes higher than the cost of just doing it.</p><p>Speed also eliminates the agonizing prioritization of small tasks. Every person has a mental threshold for &#8220;worth fixing&#8221;&#8212;we ignore bugs that take hours to fix but offer little value. When the cost of execution collapses to near-zero, that threshold vanishes. You stop managing a backlog based on effort and start fixing problems purely based on impact.</p><h3>You can trade assets with consumables.</h3><p>The ROI threshold for software or other assets collapses. You begin building \"single-use software\" (a dashboard used for one week during Q4 planning, or a complex script for a single customer) and then delete it. Code stops being an Asset (something you maintain, refactor, and cherish) and becomes a Consumable (something you generate, use, and discard). This logic extends to roles and systems, where you trade permanent fixtures for instantaneous solutions. In a slow world, analyst is a permanent role because answering complex questions is hard and ongoing; in a fast world, you don't hire an &#8220;analyst&#8221;<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://blog.sshh.io/feed#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a> but maintain a system (context and infrastructure) for answering questions instantly. The role or specialization exists only as long as the problem does.</p><p>(See also <a href=\"https://blog.sshh.io/p/most-code-is-just-cache\">Most Code is Just Cache</a>)</p><h3>You can swap plotting for steering.</h3><p>When execution takes months, you need a map. You need to tell the higher ups what you will be doing in Q4 so you can hire for it in Q1. But if you can build anything in an week, a X-month roadmap is a liability, it locks you into assumptions that will be obsolete in X days. In a slow world, we write PRDs and mockups because they are cheaper than code. We try to simulate the future in a Google Doc to avoid building the wrong thing. With speed, the \"imagination gap\" disappears. You stop arguing about <em>how</em> a feature might work and start arguing about the <em>actual working feature</em>.</p><h3>You can work on the derivative. </h3><p>Most of what you spend time doing today, you will not be doing in five years. When a task takes 4 hours, your brain is occupied by the execution&#8212;the &#8220;velocity&#8221;. When that same task is automated to take 4 occupied seconds, your brain is forced to shift to the &#8220;acceleration&#8221;. You stop fixing the specific bug; you fix the rule that allowed the bug. </p><p>With general intelligence, you can go a layer deeper: you can accelerate the acceleration. You don&#8217;t just write the prompt that fixes the code; you build the evaluation pipeline that automatically optimizes the prompts. You stop working on the work, and start working on the optimization of the work. You shift from First-Order execution (doing the thing), to Second-Order automation (improving the system), to Third-Order meta-optimization (automating the improvement of the system). AI eats the lower derivatives, constantly pushing you up the stack to become the architect of the machine that builds the machine.</p><h3>You can learn faster than you decay.</h3><p>In the old world, 'measure twice, cut once' was virtuous because construction was expensive. In the new world, the cost of a wrong hypothesis is near-zero, but the cost of obsolescence is incredibly high. If a project takes six months to ship, you risk solving a problem that no longer exists with tools that are already outdated. This speed also hacks probability. Even if you are brilliant, some percentage of your decisions are guaranteed to be wrong due to hidden variables. By moving fast, you increase your &#8220;luck surface area&#8221;<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://blog.sshh.io/feed#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a>. You take more shots on goal, test more hypotheses, and stumble into more happy accidents. </p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Thanks for reading Shrivu&#8217;s Substack!

They are never doing the same thing they were doing six months ago because they have already systemized that role away. The divide between those who &#8220;get it&#8221; and those who don&#8217;t is widening<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://blog.sshh.io/feed#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a>; the former are architects of their own obsolescence, while the latter repeat the same loop until AI automates it for them. The former view repetitive effort as a personal failure, willing to spend time automating a one-hour task just to ensure they and no one else have to do it again.</p><h3>Automate everything</h3><p>You can&#8217;t leave anything on the table. This is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law\">Amdahl&#8217;s Law</a> for AI transformation: as the &#8220;core&#8221; work approaches zero duration, the &#8220;trivial&#8221; manual steps you ignored&#8212;the 10-minute deploy, the manual data entry on a UI, the waiting for CI&#8212;become the entire bottleneck. The speed of your system is no longer determined by how fast you code, but by the one thing you didn&#8217;t automate<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" href=\"https://blog.sshh.io/feed#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a>. If an agent can fix a bug in 5 minutes but it takes 3 days for Security to review the text or 2 days for Design to approve the padding, the organization has become the bug. You need to treat organizational latency with the same severity you treat server latency.</p><h3>Practice destruction</h3><p>When creating is free, the volume of mediocre &#8220;things&#8221; approaches infinity. To survive, you must simultaneously raise your taste and lower your sentiment. You need the taste to look at ten AI-generated approaches and intuitively know which nine are subtle garbage. And you need the destructive discipline to delete the code you generated last week because it has served its purpose. We are biologically wired to hoard what we build (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect\">IKEA effect</a>), but in an age of infinite generation, hoarding leads to complexity, and complexity kills speed. If you automate the building but not the pruning, you won&#8217;t get faster; you will drown in a swamp of your own AI slop.</p><h3>Tax the debate and the review</h3><p>Diverse opinions are vital. But we need to change where the disagreement happens. In the old world, we argued in rooms about predictions (&#8221;I think users will want X&#8221;) and held tedious reviews to catch errors. In the new world, a manual review is just a manifestation of a lack of automation in creation. Instead of reviewing the output, you should be debating the <em>system</em> that created it. If you are constantly reviewing the same class of errors, stop reviewing the code and start fixing the context that generated it. Stop debating which decision predicts the future and start debating the system and its actual outputs. Shift the expertise from the end of the process (critique) to the beginning (system design).</p><h3>Move faster</h3><p>We are conditioned to expect friction, to wait for builds, to schedule meetings, to \"sleep on it\". When intelligence is on tap and initiation is near-instant, waiting starts to become a choice, not a necessity. In a slow world, we use the \"waiting time\" of the process to subsidize our own lack of clarity. In a fast world, that subsidy is gone. If you aren't moving, it's not because the system is compiling; it's because <em>you</em> don't know what to do next.</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Thanks for reading Shrivu&#8217;s Substack!

Music as a system. As Eno puts it,</p><blockquote><p>My contention is that a primary focus of experimental music has been toward its own organization, and toward its own capacity to produce and control variety, and to assimilate &#8220;natural variety&#8221; &#8212; the &#8220;interference value&#8221; of the environment. Experimental music, unlike classical (or avant-garde) music, does not typically offer instructions toward highly specific results, and hence does not normally specify wholly repeatable configurations of sound&#8230;. I hope to show that an experimental composition aims to set in motion a system or organism that will generate unique (that is, not necessarily repeatable) outputs, but that, at the same time, seeks to limit the range of these outputs.<br /><em>(Brian Eno, 1976, <a href=\"https://www.moredarkthanshark.org/eno_int_studint-novdec76.html\">Generating and organizing variety in the arts</a>)</em></p></blockquote><p>He later contrasts this bottom-up generative approach to the top-down approach of traditional musical scores. In a traditional score, you play the music. In a generative score, you play with the system that plays the music.</p><p>It seems to me that AI agents turn all of us into generative composers. Instead of writing the code, we write a generative score for agents to write the code. Instead of playing the music, we&#8217;re playing the system.</p><div><hr /></div><p>If you&#8217;re a programmer, this isn&#8217;t exactly new. We don&#8217;t actually write the ones and zeros the computer executes. We haven&#8217;t done that in a long time. Instead, we write the code that writes the code that writes the code that writes the ones and zeros.</p><p>So, in a sense, an AI coding agent just adds another layer to the cake. Agents generate code, which generates code, which generates code&#8230; However, the critical difference with agents is in the expressiveness of the generative system. Sure, a programming language like JavaScript allows us to express ourselves using higher-level concepts, and these are later compiled into ones and zeros. Yet JavaScript is still a formal language. It describes exact instructions, and the same script will generate the same exact instructions, every time. This is a bit like the traditional musical score, specifying how to play the music within fairly tight tolerances. A coding agent, by contrast, takes an English prompt, and extrapolates it into code. The agent is making an intuitive leap, from informal language, to a formal language, from a gesture, to a fully-specified set of instructions. There is a lot of ambiguity in that extrapolation process. The same prompt may generate different programs each time it is run.</p><p>But what if we see this ambiguity as a creative opportunity? Take Terry Riley&#8217;s <em>In C</em>, another generative piece. Its score is unusual:</p><blockquote><p>All performers play from the same page of 53 melodic patterns played in sequence.</p><p>Any number of any kind of instruments can play. A group of about 35 is desired if possible but smaller or larger groups will work. If vocalist(s) join in they can use any vowel and consonant sounds they like.</p><p>Patterns are to be played consecutively with each performer having the freedom to determine how many times he or she will repeat each pattern before moving on to the next. There is no fixed rule as to the number of repetitions a pattern may have, however, since performances normally average between 45 minutes and an hour and a half, it can be assumed that one would repeat each pattern from somewhere between 45 seconds and a minute and a half or longer.</p></blockquote><p>There&#8217;s a lot of ambiguity here. That ambiguity results in radically different performances. So here is a performance with Terry Riley,</p><div class=\"youtube-wrap\" id=\"youtube2-lJPJywWfyGo\"><div class=\"youtube-inner\"></div></div><p>&#8230;and another one, this time incorporating kora, balafon, and tama.</p><div class=\"youtube-wrap\" id=\"youtube2-aX96z7AuICs\"><div class=\"youtube-inner\"></div></div><p>&#8230;and my personal favorite, by Invisible Polytechnic. It&#8217;s so energetic and cheerful.</p><div class=\"bandcamp-wrap album\"></div><p>The ambiguity of the instructions is what makes <em>In C</em> so special. There is no one exact way to play it. Individual performers are given the freedom to interpret the instructions for themselves, making every performance a surprise to the audience, and to the performers.</p><blockquote><p>Instead of trying to specify it in full details, you specify it only somewhat. You then ride on the dynamics of the system in the direction you want to go.<br /><em>(Stafford Beer, 1972, &#8220;Brain of the Firm&#8221;)</em></p></blockquote><p>How might we adopt this creative stance toward AI agents?</p><div><hr /></div><p>There is no &#8220;correct&#8221; version of <em>In C</em>. The variety is the point&#8230; which is another way to look at this. In traditional programming, the coder has <em><a href=\"https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27150\">requisite variety</a></em> to control the system, which is another way of saying that the system we&#8217;re working with, the system of code and compilers, is just not <em>that</em> complex. Its behavior can fit into our head.</p><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27150\">Ashby&#8217;s Law of Requisite Variety</a>: If a system is to be stable, the number of states of its control mechanism must be greater than or equal to the number of states in the system being controlled.</p></blockquote><p>But working with an AI agent is different. Some of the complexity gets transferred out of our head, and into the head of the agent. The agent gains variety. Much more variety than a compiler. By working with it, we sacrifice some of our requisite variety, and lose some of our direct control over the system. But what if that&#8217;s good? Can we work with <em>variety</em> as a creative material?</p><p>How would <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Fortress\">Dwarf Fortress</a> think about this? <em>&#8220;You basically have a group of dwarves, and they mine in the mountains. You don&#8217;t control any specific dwarf, but you just kind of order their general activities&#8230;&#8221;</em> Maybe the future of creative work looks more like Dwarf Fortress?</p><div class=\"youtube-wrap\" id=\"youtube2-VAhHkJQ3KgY\"><div class=\"youtube-inner\"></div></div><p>What if, as Eno suggests, our role as programmers, artists, designers, and thinkers, expands beyond playing the music, to playing with the system? To sculpting the variety of our agentic systems?</p>"

Here are a couple videos I was able to make in &lt;10 minutes summarizring data on my blog.</p> <p>First, here is published posts over time. I had Claude write some scripts to generate this dataset, and then did a series of prompts to get the right visual. It was pretty straightforward, worked well, and I imagine I could have gotten to the right video much faster if I&rsquo;d had a clearer destination when I started.</p> <video controls=\"controls\" width=\"100%\"> <source src=\"https://lethain.com/static/blog/2026/BlogPostsChart.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> </video> <p>Second, here&rsquo;s a video of showing the published blog posts over time, my most frequently used tags at that point in time, and how many posts I published at each employer along the way.</p> <video controls=\"controls\" width=\"100%\"> <source src=\"https://lethain.com/static/blog/2026/BlogPostsTimeline.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> </video> <p>Altogether, this was a really fascinating to see how effectively Claude and Remotion together were able to generate fairly complex videos. This is definitely something I could imagine using again.</p>",

That&rsquo;s a noble endeavor, and one I still aim to improve at today. However, a lot of the problems you encounter later in your career are <a href=\"https://lethain.com/navigating-ambiguity/\">deeply ambiguous</a>, and it simply isn&rsquo;t possible to eliminate bad outcomes. Some examples of this are:</p> <ol> <li>Hiring is always a probabilistic endeavor. Even the best hires can struggle in a given company/role or have a life-changing event that leads to poor fit</li> <li>The 2020 pandemic broke many business models that were doing extremely well before then. Similarly, many companies overindexed on the shifts online driven by the pandemic, overhiring in ways that resulted in significant long-term harm to those companies</li> <li>Pursuing data locality for your product: there&rsquo;s always a cost",

Some examples of the pressure without a plan pattern that I&rsquo;ve seen:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The aforementioned Digg V4 launch was pressure without a plan in two ways. First, a fixed launch date was set to motivate engineering, but we had no clear mechanism to launch on that date. Fixing things after the launch was pressure without a plan as well.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"https://lethain.com/uber-service-migration-strategy/\">Uber&rsquo;s service migration</a> had a well-defined platform as the <em>destination</em> for things removed from the Python monolith, but initially did not have a clear plan for leaving the monolith other than escaping the top-down pressure.</p>",
