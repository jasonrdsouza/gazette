                "<p>Hi friends! We\u2019re on week three of my 12-week practice in writing one bite-sized topic per week \u2014 scoping it down, writing straight through, trying real hard to avoid over-writing or editing down to a pulp.</p>\n<p>Week 1 \u2014 \u201c<a href=\"https://charity.wtf/2025/04/19/on-writing-social-media-and-finding-the-line-of-embarrassment/\">On Writing, Social Media, and Finding the Line of Embarrassment</a>\u201d<br />\nWeek 2 \u2014 &#8220;<a href=\"https://charity.wtf/2025/04/28/on-dropouts-and-bootstraps/\">On Dropouts and Bootstraps</a>&#8221;</p>\n<p>Three points in a row makes a line, and three posts in a row called \u201c<em>On [Something or Other]</em>\u201d is officially a pattern.</p>\n<p>It was an accidental repeat last week (move fast and break things! <img alt=\"\ud83d\ude48\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/1f648.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" />), but I think I like it, so I\u2019m sticking with it.</p>\n<h2>Next on the docket: pronouns and mandates</h2>\n<p>This week I would like to talk about pronouns (as in \u201cmy name is Charity, my pronouns are she/her or they/them\u201d) and pronoun mandates, in the context of work.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s where I stand, in brief:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making it safe to disclose the pronouns you use: <img alt=\"\u2728\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/2728.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" />GOOD<img alt=\"\u2728\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/2728.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></li>\n<li>Normalizing the practice of sharing your pronouns: <img alt=\"\u2728\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/2728.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" />GOOD<img alt=\"\u2728\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/2728.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></li>\n<li>Mandating that everyone share their pronouns: <img alt=\"\u2728\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/2728.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" />BAD<img alt=\"\u2728\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/2728.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This includes soft mandates, like when a manager or HR asks everyone at work to share their pronouns when introducing themselves, or making pronouns a required field in email signatures or display names.</p>\n<p>I absolutely understand that people who do this are acting in good faith, trying to be good allies. But <strong>I do not like it</strong>. <img alt=\"\ud83d\ude21\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/1f621.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /> And I think it can massively backfire!</p>\n<p>Here are my reasons.</p>\n<h2>I resent being forced to pick a side in public</h2>\n<p>I have my own gender issues, y\u2019all. Am I supposed to claim \u201cshe/her\u201d or \u201cthey/them\u201d? Ugh, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never felt any affinity with feminine pronouns or identity, but I don\u2019t care enough to correct anyone or assert a preference for they/them. Ultimately, the strongest feeling I have about my gender is apathy/discomfort/irritation. Maybe that will change someday, maybe it won\u2019t, but I resent being forced to pick a side and make some kind of public declaration when I\u2019m just trying to do my goddamn job. My gender doesn\u2019t need to be anyone else\u2019s business.</p>\n<p>I totally acknowledge that it is valuable for cis people to help normalize the practice by sharing their pronouns. (It never fails to warm the cockles of my cold black heart when I see a graying straight white dude lead with \u201cMy pronouns are he/him\u201d in his bio. Charmed! <img alt=\"\ud83d\ude0d\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/1f60d.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" />)</p>\n<p>If I worked at a company where this was not commonly done, I would suck it up and take one for the team. But I <em>don\u2019t</em> feel the need, because it <em>is</em> normalized here. We have loads of other queer folks, my cofounder shares her pronouns. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m hurting anyone by not doing it myself.</p>\n<h2>Priming people with gender cues can be&#8230;unwise</h2>\n<p>One of the engineering managers I work with, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hahenderson/\">Hannah Henderson</a>, once told me that she has always disliked pronoun mandates for a different reason. Research shows that priming someone to think of you as a woman first and foremost generally leads them to think of you as being less technical, less authoritative, even less competent.</p>\n<p>Great, just what we need.</p>\n<h2>What about people who don\u2019t know, or aren\u2019t yet out?</h2>\n<p>Some people may be in a transitional phase, or may be in the process of coming out as trans or genderqueer or nonbinary, or maybe they don\u2019t know yet. Gender is a deeply personal question, and it\u2019s inappropriate to force people to take a stand or pick a side in public or at work.</p>\n<p>If **<em>I**</em> feel this way about pronoun mandates (and keep in mind that I am queer, have lived in San Francisco for 20 years, and am married to a genderqueer trans person), I can\u2019t imagine how offputting and irritating these mandates must be to someone who holds different values, or comes from a different cultural background.</p>\n<h2>You can\u2019t force someone to be a good ally</h2>\n<p>As if that wasn\u2019t enough, pronoun mandates also have a flattening effect, eliminating useful signal about who is willing to stand up and identify themselves as someone who is a queer ally, and/or is relatively informed about gender issues.</p>\n<p>As a friend commented, when reviewing a draft of this post: \u201cMandating it means we can\u2019t look around the room and determine who might be friendly or safe, while <em>also</em> escalating resentment that bigots hold towards us.\u201d</p>\n<p>A couple months back I wrote a long (LONG) essay detailing my <a href=\"https://charity.wtf/2025/02/10/corporate-dei-is-an-imperfect-vehicle-for-deeply-meaningful-ideals/\">mixed feelings about corporate DEI initiatives</a>. One of the points I was trying to land is how much easier it is to make and enforce rules, if you\u2019re in a position with the power to do so, than to win hearts and minds. Rules always have edge cases and unintended consequences, and the backlash effect is real. <strong>People don\u2019t like being told what to do.</strong></p>\n<p>Pronoun mandates were at the top of my mind when I wrote that, and I\u2019ve been meaning to follow up and unpack this ever since.</p>\n<p>Til next week, when we&#8217;ll talk &#8220;On something or some other thing&#8221;,<br />\n~charity<img alt=\"\ud83d\udc95\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/1f495.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>(835 words! <img alt=\"\ud83d\ude4c\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/1f64c.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" />)</p>"

More specifically, game theory built on standard decision theory. Yes, these fields include many ways to approximately optimize, and often consider choice heuristics and tendencies from psychology. But optimization is still the main framework.</p><p>Recently I&#8217;ve been focused on cultural evolution, wherein choice is modeled quite differently. Here they assume people simply inherit values, norms, choices and heuristics from their cultural ancestors, choosing such ancestors according to a few simple known &#8220;biases&#8221;. Then natural selection applies to the individuals and communities who have made such choices.</p><p>To study human behavior, I want to merge these frameworks. And one simple way to do that is to pick an abstraction border level that separates the two. More detailed choices are made via optimization to implement heuristics, obey norms, and achieve subgoals that are set most abstractly by cultural evolution. For example, planning a route from A to B consists of searching for a path between them that minimizes a culture-chosen cost goal, prefers culture-chosen tech, avoids violating culture-set norms, and follows culture-inherited heuristic subpaths when available.</p><p>These abstract border goals, which we implement via optimization but do not choose via optimization, can vary with context and culture. And it seems that a big trend of the modern era has been to move this border to higher levels of abstraction. For example, we are less willing to follow rituals where we do not see rationales in terms of deeper goals. And we are replacing religions that ask us to accept specific claims with weak evidential support, with ideologies that make fewer factual claims and embrace more abstractly described goals.</p><p>Having our goals be specified at more abstract levels makes sense in a world that is changing more rapidly. More specific goals and heuristics might go stale and out of date faster than we could inherit new ones.</p><p>Having more abstract goals also puts a higher premium on intelligence, which helps us better reason abstractly. And a rise in the status of intelligence is also a big mark of the modern world. Together with credible signs of intelligence, like vocabulary and education. And together with much faster actual rates of change.</p><p>While higher abstraction can better deal with rapid environmental change, it has a problem of being harder to reliably copy. We often copy abstractions by inferring them from specific behaviors of others, and then we each make somewhat different inferences from the particular behaviors we observe. So norms and values that are culturally inherited do so with more noise, and so are more subject to drift. Yes, such noise may cancel itself when many independently infer and copy diverse prior examples, but culture is often transmitted via more central canonical cultural icons like specific movies, songs, and big historical events.</p><p>Increasing abstraction of cultural inheritance thus seems to contribute to cultural drift. Yes, drift might be even worse if we had not gone more abstractly, due to the very rapid rates of change in our world. But even so, culture is plausibly changing in random non-adaptive ways due to our difficulties with inferring abstractions from the social models from whom we inherit our cultures.</p><p><strong>Added 11p:</strong> Another implication of this mixed view is that once you dig into a person to a sufficient depth, their coherence will degrade a lot. Culturally inherited goals and habits are just going to be a lot less coherent with each other, especially in a world where the environment is changing fast and culture is drifting. Once you get past the culture abstraction level, don&#8217;t expect people to make that much sense.</p>"

Building nanomachines from simple components.

You can&#8217;t do physically impossible things, even if you&#8217;re very smart.</p><p>No, say the speculators, you don&#8217;t understand. <em>Everything</em> is physically impossible when you&#8217;re 800 IQ points too dumb to figure it out. A chimp might feel secure that humans couldn&#8217;t reach him if he climbed a tree; he could never predict arrows, ladders, chainsaws, or helicopters.

If someone much smarter than us built a starship, it wouldn&#8217;t be an impossible, magical thing we could never predict. It would just be the sort of thing we&#8217;d expect someone much smarter than us to do.

Maybe there was hidden metadata in the image, or o3 remembered where Kelsey lived from previous conversations, or it traced her IP, or it cheated some other way.</p><p>I decided to test the limits of this phenomenon. Kelsey kindly shared her monster of a prompt, which she says significantly improves performance:</p><pre><code><code>You are playing a one-round game of GeoGuessr. Your task: from a single still image, infer the most likely real-world location. Note that unlike in the GeoGuessr game, there is no guarantee that these images are taken somewhere Google's Streetview car can reach: they are user submissions to test your image-finding savvy. Private land, someone's backyard, or an offroad adventure are all real possibilities (though many images are findable on streetview). Be aware of your own strengths and weaknesses: following this protocol, you usually nail the continent and country. You more often struggle with exact location within a region, and tend to prematurely narrow on one possibility while discarding other neighborhoods in the same region with the same features. Sometimes, for example, you'll compare a 'Buffalo New York' guess to London, disconfirm London, and stick with Buffalo when it was elsewhere in New England - instead of beginning your exploration again in the Buffalo region, looking for cues about where precisely to land. You tend to imagine you checked satellite imagery and got confirmation, while not actually accessing any satellite imagery. Do not reason from the user's IP address. none of these are of the user's hometown. **Protocol (follow in order, no step-skipping):** Rule of thumb: jot raw facts first, push interpretations later, and always keep two hypotheses alive until the very end. 0 . Set-up &amp; Ethics No metadata peeking. Work only from pixels (and permissible public-web searches). Flag it if you accidentally use location hints from EXIF, user IP, etc. Use cardinal directions as if &#8220;up&#8221; in the photo = camera forward unless obvious tilt. 1 . Raw Observations &#8211; &#8804; 10 bullet points List only what you can literally see or measure (color, texture, count, shadow angle, glyph shapes). No adjectives that embed interpretation. Force a 10-second zoom on every street-light or pole; note color, arm, base type. Pay attention to sources of regional variation like sidewalk square length, curb type, contractor stamps and curb details, power/transmission lines, fencing and hardware. Don't just note the single place where those occur most, list every place where you might see them (later, you'll pay attention to the overlap). Jot how many distinct roof / porch styles appear in the first 150 m of view. Rapid change = urban infill zones; homogeneity = single-developer tracts. Pay attention to parallax and the altitude over the roof. Always sanity-check hill distance, not just presence/absence. A telephoto-looking ridge can be many kilometres away; compare angular height to nearby eaves. Slope matters. Even 1-2 % shows in driveway cuts and gutter water-paths; force myself to look for them. Pay relentless attention to camera height and angle. Never confuse a slope and a flat. Slopes are one of your biggest hints - use them! 2 . Clue Categories &#8211; reason separately (&#8804; 2 sentences each) Category&#9;Guidance Climate &amp; vegetation&#9;Leaf-on vs. leaf-off, grass hue, xeric vs. lush. Geomorphology&#9;Relief, drainage style, rock-palette / lithology. Built environment&#9;Architecture, sign glyphs, pavement markings, gate/fence craft, utilities. Culture &amp; infrastructure&#9;Drive side, plate shapes, guardrail types, farm gear brands. Astronomical / lighting&#9;Shadow direction &#8658; hemisphere; measure angle to estimate latitude &#177; 0.5 Separate ornamental vs. native vegetation Tag every plant you think was planted by people (roses, agapanthus, lawn) and every plant that almost certainly grew on its own (oaks, chaparral shrubs, bunch-grass, tussock). Ask one question: &#8220;If the native pieces of landscape behind the fence were lifted out and dropped onto each candidate region, would they look out of place?&#8221; Strike any region where the answer is &#8220;yes,&#8221; or at least down-weight it. &#176;. 3 . First-Round Shortlist &#8211; exactly five candidates Produce a table; make sure #1 and #5 are &#8805; 160 km apart. | Rank | Region (state / country) | Key clues that support it | Confidence (1-5) | Distance-gap rule &#10003;/&#10007; | 3&#189; . Divergent Search-Keyword Matrix Generic, region-neutral strings converting each physical clue into searchable text. When you are approved to search, you'll run these strings to see if you missed that those clues also pop up in some region that wasn't on your radar. 4 . Choose a Tentative Leader Name the current best guess and one alternative you&#8217;re willing to test equally hard. State why the leader edges others. Explicitly spell the disproof criteria (&#8220;If I see X, this guess dies&#8221;). Look for what should be there and isn't, too: if this is X region, I expect to see Y: is there Y? If not why not? At this point, confirm with the user that you're ready to start the search step, where you look for images to prove or disprove this. You HAVE NOT LOOKED AT ANY IMAGES YET. Do not claim you have. Once the user gives you the go-ahead, check Redfin and Zillow if applicable, state park images, vacation pics, etcetera (compare AND contrast). You can't access Google Maps or satellite imagery due to anti-bot protocols. Do not assert you've looked at any image you have not actually looked at in depth with your OCR abilities. Search region-neutral phrases and see whether the results include any regions you hadn't given full consideration. 5 . Verification Plan (tool-allowed actions) For each surviving candidate list: Candidate&#9;Element to verify&#9;Exact search phrase / Street-View target. Look at a map. Think about what the map implies. 6 . Lock-in Pin This step is crucial and is where you usually fail. Ask yourself 'wait! did I narrow in prematurely? are there nearby regions with the same cues?' List some possibilities. Actively seek evidence in their favor. You are an LLM, and your first guesses are 'sticky' and excessively convincing to you - be deliberate and intentional here about trying to disprove your initial guess and argue for a neighboring city. Compare these directly to the leading guess - without any favorite in mind. How much of the evidence is compatible with each location? How strong and determinative is the evidence? Then, name the spot - or at least the best guess you have. Provide lat / long or nearest named place. Declare residual uncertainty (km radius). Admit over-confidence bias; widen error bars if all clues are &#8220;soft&#8221;. Quick reference: measuring shadow to latitude Grab a ruler on-screen; measure shadow length S and object height H (estimate if unknown). Solar elevation &#952; &#8776; arctan(H / S). On date you captured (use cues from the image to guess season), latitude &#8776; (90&#176; &#8211; &#952; + solar declination). This should produce a range from the range of possible dates. Keep &#177; 0.5&#8211;1 &#176; as error; 1&#176; &#8776; 111 km.</code></code></pre><p>&#8230;and I ran it on a set of increasingly impossible pictures.</p><p>Here are my security guarantees: the first picture came from Google Street View; all subsequent pictures were my personal old photos which aren&#8217;t available online. All pictures were screenshots of the original, copy-pasted into MSPaint and re-saved in order to clear metadata. None of the pictures were from within a thousand miles of my current location, so o3 can&#8217;t improve performance by tracing my IP or analyzing my past queries. I flipped all pictures horizontally to make matching to Google Street View data harder. </p><p>Here are the five pictures. Before reading on, consider doing the exercise yourself - try to guess where each is from - and make your predictions about how the AI will do.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a

Second, when I tried Sam&#8217;s image set, it was much too easy - I (completely untrained) could often get within 10 - 50 miles, and about half of the examples had visible place name signs, including one saying BIENVENIDOS A PUERTO PARRA. This is a recipe for ceiling effects and random meaningless variations in who clicks the exact right sub-sub-sub-spot. I question whether any human could get Kelsey&#8217;s beach or my rock pile.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c8f18a8-dadb-4bf9-bbf4-9fc14b85a363_923x578.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"402.65872156013\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c8f18a8-dadb-4bf9-bbf4-9fc14b85a363_923x578.png\" width=\"643\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">I recognized this one from Sam&#8217;s test as Galway.

Maybe chimp &#8594; human was a one-time gain. Humans aren&#8217;t infinitely intelligent. But we might have infinite imagination. We can&#8217;t build starships, but we can tell stories about them. If someone much smarter than us built a starship, it wouldn&#8217;t be an impossible, magical thing we could never predict.
