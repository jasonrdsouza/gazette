/>\n</a></p>\n\n<p>This scrolling grid of posters is something I\u2019d like to reuse for other media collections \u2013 books, comics, and TV shows.</p>\n\n<p>I wrote an initial implementation with <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Grid_layout\">CSS grid layout</a>, but over time I found rough edges and bugs.\nI\u00a0kept adding rules and properties to \u201cfix\u201d the layout, but these piecemeal changes introduced new bugs and conflicts, and eventually I no longer understood the page as a whole.\nThis gradual degradation often happens when I write CSS, and when I no longer understand how the page works, it\u2019s time to reset and start again.</p>\n\n<p>To help me understand how this layout works, I\u2019m going to step through it and

the unstyled HTML</h2>\n\n<p>This is a list of movies, so I use an <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/ul\">unordered list <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code></a>.\nEach list item is pretty basic, with just an image and a title.\nI\u00a0wrap them both in a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/figure\"><code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element</a> \u2013 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s strictly necessary, but it feels semantically correct to group the image and title together.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lng-html\"><code><span class=\"nt\">&lt;ul</span> <span class=\"na\">id=</span><span class=\"s\">\"movies\"</span><span

list is ordered alphabetically, but I decided against it because the numbering isn\u2019t important.</p>\n\n<p>Having a particular item be #1 is meaningful in a ranked list (the 100 best movies) or a sequence of steps (a cooking recipe), but there\u2019s less significance to #1 in an alphabetical list.\nIf I get a new movie that goes at the top of the list, it doesn\u2019t matter that the previous #1 has moved to #2.</p>\n\n<p>This is an unstyled HTML page, so it looks pretty rough:</p>\n\n<!-- npx playwright screenshot -b webkit --viewport-size '1520,920'

Below each poster is a blue link with the title of the movie. Every poster is the same width, but some are different heights.\" class=\"screenshot dark_aware\" src=\"https://alexwlchan.net/images/2026/mp-css-demo2-grid_1x.png\" width=\"750\" />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>After this step, what stands out here is the inconsistent heights, especially the text beneath the posters.\nThe mismatched height of <em>The Empire Strikes Block</em> is obvious, but the posters for <em>The Devil Wears Padding</em> and <em>vh for Vendetta</em> are also slightly shorter than their neighbours.\nLet\u2019s fix that next.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"step-3-choosing-the-correct-column-size\">Step 3: Choosing the correct column size</h2>\n\n<p>Although movie posters are always portrait orientation, the aspect ratio can vary.\nBecause my first grid fixes the width, some posters will be a different height to others.</p>\n\n<p>I prefer to have the posters be fixed height and allow varied widths, so all the text is on the same level.\nLet\u2019s replace the width rule on images:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lng-css\"><code><span class=\"nf\">#movies</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">img</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nl\">height</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"m\">300px</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>This causes an issue with my columns, because now some of the posters are wider than 200px, and overflow into their neighbour.\nI\u00a0need to pick a column size which is wide enough to allow all of my posters at this fixed height.\nI\u00a0can calculate the displayed width of a single poster:</p>\n\n<math display=\"block\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n  <mtext>display width</mtext>\n  <mo>=</mo>\n  <mi>300px</mi>\n  <mo>\u00d7</mo>\n  <mfrac>\n    <mtext>poster width</mtext>\n    <mtext>poster height</mtext>\n  </mfrac>\n</math>\n\n<p>Then I pick the largest display width in my collection, so even the widest poster has enough room to breathe without overlapping its neighbour.</p>\n\n<p>In my case, the largest poster is 225px wide when it\u2019s shown at 300px tall, so I change my column rule to match:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lng-css\"><code><span class=\"nf\">#movies</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nl\">grid-template-columns</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nf\">repeat</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">auto-fill</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"m\">225px</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>If I ever change the height of the posters or get a wider poster, I\u2019ll need to adjust this widths.\nIf I was adding movies too fast for that to be sustainable, I\u2019d look at using something like <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/object-fit#cover\"><code>object-fit: cover</code></a> to clip anything that was extra wide.\nI\u2019ve skipped that here because I don\u2019t need it, and I like seeing the whole poster.</p>\n\n<p>If you have big columns or small devices, you need some extra CSS to make columns and images shrink when they\u2019re wider than the device, but I can ignore that here.\nA\u00a0225px column is narrower than my iPhone, which is the smallest device I\u2019ll use this for.\n(I did try writing that CSS, and I quickly got stuck.\nI\u2019ll come back to it if it\u2019s ever an issue, but I don\u2019t need it today.)</p>\n\n<p>Now the posters which are narrower than the column are flush left with the edge of the column, whereas I\u2019d really like them to be centred inside the column.\nI\u00a0cam fix this with one more rule:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lng-css\"><code><span class=\"nf\">#movies</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">li</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nl\">text-align</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">center</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is a more subtle transformation from the previous step \u2013 nothing\u2019s radically different, but all the posters line up neatly in a way they didn\u2019t before.</p>\n\n<!-- npx playwright screenshot -b webkit --viewport-size '1520,750' file:///Users/alexwlchan/repos/alexwlchan.net/src/_files/2026/movie-poster-css/demo3-geometry.html /Users/alexwlchan/repos/alexwlchan.net/src/_images/2026/mp-css-demo3-geometry.png -->\n\n<p><a

/>\n</a></p>\n\n<p>Swapping fixed width for fixed height means there\u2019s now an inconsistent amount of horizontal space between posters \u2013 but I find that less noticeable.\nYou can\u2019t get a fixed space in both directions unless all your posters have the same aspect ratio, which would mean clipping or stretching.\nI\u2019d rather have the slightly inconsistent gaps.</p>\n\n<p>The white background and blue underlined text are still giving \u201cunstyled HTML page\u201d vibes, so let\u2019s tidy up the colours.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"step-4-invert-the-colours-with-a-dark-background\">Step 4: Invert the colours with a dark background</h2>\n\n<p>The next set of rules change the page to white text on a dark background.\nI\u00a0use a dark grey, so I can distinguish the posters which often use black:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lng-css\"><code><span class=\"nt\">body</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nl\">background</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span

class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">none</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let\u2019s also make the text bigger, and add a bit of spacing between it and the image.\nAnd when the title and image are more spaced apart, let\u2019s increase the row spacing even more, so it\u2019s always clear which title goes with which poster:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lng-css\"><code><span class=\"nf\">#movies</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"py\">grid-row-gap</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"m\">3em</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n  \n  <span class=\"nt\">figcaption</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nl\">font-size</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>  <span

class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The movie title is a good opportunity to use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/text-wrap\"><code>text-wrap: balance</code></a>.\nThis tells the browser to balance the length of each line, which can make the text look a bit nicer.\nYou\u2019ll get several lines of roughly the same length, rather than one or more long lines and a short line.\nFor example, it changes <em>\u201cThe Empire Strikes // Block\u201d</em> to the more balanced <em>\u201cThe Empire // Strikes Block\u201d</em>.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lng-css\"><code><span class=\"nf\">#movies</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>  \n  <span

placeholder colours</h2>\n\n<p>As my movie collection grows, I want to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img#loading\">lazy load</a> my images so I don\u2019t try to load them all immediately, especially posters that aren\u2019t scrolled into view.\nBut then if I scroll and I\u2019m on a slow connection, it can take a few seconds for the image to load, and until then the page has a hole.\nI\u00a0like having solid colour placeholders which get replaced by the image when it loads.</p>\n\n<p>First I have to insert a wrapper <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> which I\u2019m going to colour, and a CSS variable with the aspect ratio of the poster so I can size it correctly:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lng-html\"><code><span

class=\"nt\">&lt;/li&gt;</span>\n  ...\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can add a coloured background to this wrapper and make it the right size:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lng-css\"><code><span class=\"nf\">#movies</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"err\">img,</span> <span class=\"nt\">.wrapper</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span

class=\"p\">);</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>But a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is a <code>block</code> element by default, so it isn\u2019t centred properly \u2013 it sticks to the left-hand side of the column, and doesn\u2019t line up with the text.\nWe could add <code>margin: 0 auto;</code> to move it to the middle, but that duplicates the <code>text-align: center;</code> property we wrote earlier.\nInstead, I prefer to make the wrapper an <code>inline-block</code>, so it follows the existing text alignment rule:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lng-css\"><code><span class=\"nf\">#movies</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">.wrapper</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nl\">display</span><span

<code>text-decoration</code> isn\u2019t meant to inherit, and the fact that <code>column-gap</code> and <code>row-gap</code> have replaced the older <code>grid-</code> prefixed versions.</p>\n\n<p>This layout is working well enough for now, but more importantly, I\u2019m confident I could tweak it if I want to make changes later.</p>\n\n\n    <p>[If the formatting of this

If you want to know more about why Prolog is cool instead, go <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/a48fce5b-8a05-4302-b620-9b26f057f145/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> or <a href=\"https://www.metalevel.at/prolog\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> or <a href=\"https://ianthehenry.com/posts/drinking-with-datalog/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> or <a href=\"https://logicprogramming.org/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </p> <h3>No standardized strings</h3> <p>ISO \"strings\" are just atoms or lists of single-character atoms (or lists of integer character codes). The various implementations of Prolog add custom string operators but they are not cross compatible, so code written with strings in SWI-Prolog will not work in Scryer Prolog. </p> <h3>No functions</h3> <p>Code logic is expressed entirely in <em>rules</em>, predicates which return true or false for certain values. For example if you wanted to get the length of a Prolog list, you write this:</p> <div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"s s-Atom\">?-</span> <span class=\"nf\">length</span><span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"s s-Atom\">a</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s s-Atom\">b</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s s-Atom\">c</span><span class=\"p\">],</span> <span class=\"nv\">Len</span><span class=\"p\">).</span> <span class=\"nv\">Len</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mf\">3.</span> </code></pre></div> <p class=\"empty-line\" style=\"height: 16px; margin: 0px !important;\"></p> <p>Now this is pretty cool",

                "<p>And once they take our jobs, will we be able to find new ones? Will AI take those too?</p>\n<p>Seb Krier recently wrote an unusually good take on that, which will center this post.</p>\n<p>I believe that Seb is being too optimistic on several fronts, but in a considered and highly reasonable way. The key is to understand the assumptions being made, and also to understand that he is only predicting that the era of employment optimism will last for 10-20 years.</p>\n<p>By contrast, there are others that expect human employment and even human labor share of income to remain robust indefinitely, no matter the advances of AI capabilities, even if AI can do a superior job on all tasks, often citing comparative advantage. I will centrally respond to such claims in a different future post.</p>\n<div>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-25028\"></span>\n\n\n</div>\n<p>So to disambiguate, this post is about point #2 here, but I also assert #1 and #3:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>By default, if AI capabilities continue to advance, then the humans lose control over the future and are rather likely to all die.</li>\n<li>If we manage to avoid that, then there is a good chance humans can retain a lot of employment during the rest of The Cyborg Era, which might well last 10-20 years.</li>\n<li>What is not plausible is that AI capabilities and available compute continue to increase, and this state endures indefinitely. It is a transitional state.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>First I\u2019ll make explicit the key assumptions, then unpack the central dynamics.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Normality Is Magic</h4>\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a background undiscussed \u2018magic\u2019 going on, in most scenarios where we discuss what AI does to future employment. That \u2018magic\u2019 is, somehow, ensuring everything is controlled by and run for the benefit of the humans, and is keeping the humans alive, and usually also preserving roughly our system of government and rights to private property.</p>\n<p>I believe that this is not how things are likely to turn out, or how they turn out by default.</p>\n<p>I believe that by default, if you build sufficiently capable AI, and have it generally loose in the economy, humans will cease to have control over the future, and also it is quite likely that everyone will die. All questions like those here would become moot.</p>\n<p>Thus I wish that this assumption was always made explicit, rather than being ignored or referred to as a given as it so often is. Here\u2019s Seb\u2019s version, which I\u2019ll skip ahead to:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Seb Krier: Note that even then, the humans remain the <em>beneficiaries </em>of this now \u2018closed loop\u2019 ASI economy: again, the ASI economy is not producing paper clips for their own enjoyment. But when humans \u2018demand\u2019 a new underwater theme park, the ASIs would prefer that the humans don\u2019t get involved in the production process. Remember the \u2018humans keep moving up a layer of abstraction\u2019 point above? At some point this could stop!\u200b</p></blockquote>\n<p>Why should we expect the humans to remain the beneficiaries? You don\u2019t get to assert that without justification, or laying out what assumptions underlie that claim.</p>\n<p>With that out of the way, let\u2019s assume it all works out, and proceed on that basis.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Welcome To The Cyborg Era</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aleximas.substack.com/p/the-cyborg-era-what-ai-means-for\">Seb Krier wrote recently about human job prospects in The Cyborg Era</a>.</p>\n<p>The Cyborg Era means the period where both AI and humans meaningfully contribute to a wide variety of work.</p>\n<p>I found this post to be much better than his and others\u2019 earlier efforts to explore these questions. I\u2019d have liked to see the implicit assumptions and asserted timelines be more explicit, but in terms of what happens in the absence of hardcore recursive AI self-improvement this seemed like a rather good take.</p>\n<p>I appreciate that he:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Clearly distinguishes this transitional phase from what comes later.</li>\n<li>Emphasizes that employment requires (A) complementarity to hold or (B) cases where human involvement is intrinsic to value.</li>\n<li>Sets out expectations for how fast this might play out.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote><p>Seb Krier: \u200bWe know that at least so far, AI progress is rapid but not a sudden discontinuous threshold where you get a single agent that does everything a human does perfectly; it\u2019s a jagged, continuous, arduous process that gradually reaches various capabilities at different speeds and performance levels. And we already have experience with integrating \u2018alternative general intelligences\u2019 via international trade: other humans. Whether through immigration or globalization, the integration of new pools of intelligence is always jagged and uneven rather than instantaneous.</p>\n<p>I think we get there eventually, but (a) it takes longer than bulls typically expect &#8211; I think 5-10 years personally; (b) people generally focus on digital tasks alone &#8211; they\u2019re extremely important of course, but an argument about substitution/complementarity should also account for robotics and physical bottlenecks; (c) it requires more than just capable models &#8211; products attuned to local needs, environments, and legal contexts; (d) it also requires <em>organising </em>intelligence to derive value from it &#8211; see for example Mokyr\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/what-makes-joel-mokyr-great\">work</a> on social/industrial intelligence. This means that you don\u2019t just suddenly get a hyper-versatile \u2018drop in worker\u2019 that does everything and transforms the economy overnight (though we shouldn\u2019t completely dismiss this either).</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>So I expect cyborgism to last a long time &#8211; at least until ASI is so superior that a human adds negative value/gets in the way, compute is highly abundant, bottlenecks disappear, and demand for human stuff is zero &#8211; <em>which are pretty stringent conditions</em>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I agree that cyborgism can \u2018survive a lot\u2019 in terms of expanding AI capabilities.</p>\n<p>However I believe that his ending expectation condition goes too far, especially setting the demand limit at zero. It also risks giving a false impression of how long we can expect before it happens.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Cyborg Era Will End Within Our Lifetimes</h4>\n\n\n<p>I clarified with him that what he means is that The Cyborg Era is starting now (I agree, and hello Claude Code!) and that he expects this to last on the order of 10-20 years. That\u2019s what \u2018a long time\u2019 stands for.</p>\n<p>It very much does not mean \u2018don\u2019t worry about it\u2019 or \u2018the rest of our natural lifetimes.\u2019</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/CharlesD353/status/2009580972660957379\">That is not that long a time</a>, even if this slow diffusion hypothesis is basically right.</p>\n<p>Yes, it seems likely that, as Alex Imas quotes, \u201cHuman labor share will remain a substantial part of the economy a lot longer than the AGI-maximalist timelines suggest,\u201d but \u2018a lot longer\u2019 does not mean all that long in these scenarios, and also it might not persist that long, or humans might not persist that long at all, depending on how things play out.</p>\n<blockquote><p>As long as the combination of Human + AGI yields even a marginal gain over AGI alone, the human retains a comparative advantage.\u200b</p></blockquote>\n<p>Technically and in the short term (e.g. this 10-20 year window) where the humans are \u2018already paid for\u2019 then yes, although in increasingly many places this can be false faster than you think because involving the slow humans is not cheap, and the number of humans practically required could easily end up very small. I suggest the movie <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/no-other-choice-2025/#:~:text=207K,bid%20to%20reclaim%20his%20dignity.\">No Other Choic</a>e, and expect this complementarity to apply to a steadily shrinking group of the humans.</p>\n<p>Seb correctly points out that labor can have value disconnected from the larger supply chain, but that rules a lot of things out, as per his discussions of integration costs and interface frictions.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Transitional Unemployment In The Cyborg Era Will Be High</h4>\n\n\n<p>In this style of scenario, I\u2019d expect it to be hard to disambiguate transitional unemployment from permanent structural unemployment, because the AIs will be diffusing and advancing faster than many of the humans can adapt and respecialize.</p>\n<p>Humans will need, repeatedly, to move from existing jobs to other \u2018shadow jobs\u2019 that did not previously justify employment, or that represent entirely new opportunities and modes of production. During the Cyborg Era, humans will still have a place in such new jobs, or at least have one for a time until those jobs too are automated. After the Cyborg Era ends, such jobs never materialize. They get done by AI out of the gate.</p>\n<p>Thus, if the diffusion timeline and length of the Cyborg Era is on the order of 10-20 years during which things stay otherwise normal, I\u2019d expect the second half of the Cyborg Era to involve steadily rising unemployment and falling labor power, even if \u2018at the equilibrium\u2019 of the current level of AI diffusion this would fix itself.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Congratulations, Many Of You Are Literally A Human</h4>\n\n\n<p>Mostly it seems like Seb thinks that it is plausibly that most of the work to ensure full employment will be via the \u2018literally be a human\u2019 tasks, even long after other opportunities are mostly or entirely gone.</p>\n<p>This would largely come from associated demand for intra-human positional goods and status games.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t expect it to play out that way in practice, if other opportunities do vanish. There will at least for a time be demand for such tasks. I don\u2019t see how, when you consider who is consuming and has the ability to engage in such consumption, and the AI-provided alternative options, it adds up to anything approaching full employment.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You\u2019ve Got Taste</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/sebkrier/status/2011142715761623161\">Krier later also points to bespoke human judgment or taste as a future bottleneck</a>. Such taste evolves over time, so even if you could take a snapshot of bespoke taste now it would not long remain \u2018taste complete.\u2019 And he reiterates the standard \u2018there\u2019s always more to do\u2019:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Seb Krier: People expect that at some point, \u201cit\u2019s solved\u201d &#8211; well the world is not a finite set of tasks and problems to solve. Almost everything people ever did in the ancient times is automated &#8211; and yet the world today now has more preferences to satiate and problems to solve than ever. The world hasn\u2019t yet shown signs of coalescing to a great unification or a fixed state! Of course it\u2019s conceivable that at sufficient capability levels, the generative process exhausts itself and preferences stabilize &#8211; but I\u2019d be surprised.</p>\n<p>Yinan Na: Taste changes faster than automation can capture it, that gap can create endless work.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are two distinct ways this could fail us.</p>\n<p>One, as Seb notes, is if things reached a static end state. This could eventually happen.</p>\n<p>The one Seb is neglecting, the point I keep emphasizing, is that this assumes we can outcompete the AIs on new problems, or in developing new taste, or in some other new task [N]. Even if there is always a new task [N], that only keeps the humans employed or useful if they are better at [N] than the AI, or at least useful enough to invoke comparative advantage. If that breaks down, we\u2019re cooked.</p>\n<p>If neither of those happens, and we otherwise survive, then there will remain a niche for some humans to be bespoke taste arbiters and creators, and this remains a bottleneck to some forms of growth. One should still not expect this to be a major source of employment, as bespoke taste creation or judgment ability has always been rare, and only necessary in small quantities.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Revolution of Rising AI Capabilities</h4>\n\n\n<p>Contra Imas and Krier, I do think that full substitution of AI for human labor, with the exception of literally-be-a-human tasks, should be the \u2018default assumption\u2019 for what happens in the long term even if things otherwise turn out well, as something we would eventually have to deal with.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t understand why we would expect otherwise.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Revolution of Rising Expectations</h4>\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d also note that <a href=\"https://x.com/pawtrammell/status/2009535201605492997\">even if \u2018real wages\u2019 rise in such a scenario as Trammell predicts</a> (I do not predict this), due to the economy technically growing faster than the labor share falls, that this would not fix people\u2019s real consumption problems and make people better off, for reasons I explored in <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/the-revolution-of-rising-expectations\">The Revolution of Rising Expectations</a> series. Yes, think about all the value you\u2019re getting from Claude Code, but also man\u2019s gotta eat.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Proceed With Caution</h4>\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, the caution is not to do policy interventions on this front now:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Until that specific evidence mounts, preemptive policy surgery is likely to do more harm than good.\u200b</p></blockquote>\n<p>I agree with Krier <a href=\"https://x.com/pawtrammell/status/2009535201605492997\">and also Trammell</a> that interventions aimed in particular at preserving human jobs and employment would be premature. That\u2019s a problem that emerges and can be addressed over time, and where there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty we will resolve as we go.</p>\n<p>What we need to do now on the policy front is focus on our bigger and more deadly and irreversible problems, of how we\u2019re navigating all of this while being able to stay alive and in control of and steering the future.</p>\n<p>What we shouldn\u2019t yet do are interventions designed to protect jobs.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Ostrich Take</h4>\n\n\n<p>As I said, I believe Krier gave us a good take. By contrast, here\u2019s a very bad take as an example of the \u2018no matter what humans will always be fine\u2019 attitude:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Garry Tan: But even more than that: humans will want more things, and humans will do more things assisted and supercharged by AGI</p>\n<p>\u200bAs @typesfast says: \u201cHow are people going to make money if AI is doing all the work? I think that that very much misunderstands human nature that we\u2019ll just want more things. There\u2019s an infinite desire inside the human soul can never be satisfied without God. We need more stuff. Like we got to have more. We got to have more.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, sure, we will want more things and more things will happen, but what part of \u2018AI doing all the work\u2019 do you not understand? So we previously wanted [XYZ] and now we have [XYZ] and want [ABC] too, so the AI gets us [ABCXYZ]. By construction the AI is doing all the work.</p>\n<p>You could say, that\u2019s fine, you have [ABCXYZ] without doing work. Which, if we\u2019ve managed to stay in charge and wealthy and alive despite not doing any of the work, is indeed an outcome that can be looked at various ways. You\u2019re still unemployed at best.</p>\n<p>A full response on the maximalist comparative advantage, unlimited demand and other arguments that think humans are magic will follow at a future date, in some number of parts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
