cog Caddyfile</code>), it runs the Python snippet, and anything passed to <code>cog.outl()</code> is written between the markers.\nThis is the output, which gets printed to stdout:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"n\">alexwlchan.net</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"c\">#[[[cog\n  # import cog\n  # \n  # redirects = [\n  #     {\"old_url\": \"/videos/crossness_flywheel.mp4\", \"new_url\": \"/files/2017/crossness_flywheel.mp4\"},\n  #     {\"old_url\": \"/2021/12/2021-in-reading/\", \"new_url\": \"/2021/2021-in-reading/\"},\n  #     {\"old_url\": \"/2022/12/print-sbt/\", \"new_url\": \"/til/2022/print-sbt/\"},\n  # ]\n  # \n  # for r in redirects:\n  #     cog.outl(f\"redir {r['old_url']} {r['new_url']} permanent\")\n  #]]]</span>\n  redir /videos/crossness_flywheel.mp4 /files/2017/crossness_flywheel.mp4 permanent\n  redir /2021/12/2021-in-reading/ /2021/2021-in-reading/ permanent\n  redir /2022/12/print-sbt/ /til/2022/print-sbt/ permanent\n  <span class=\"c\">#[[[end]]]</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>If I want to write the output back to the file, I run Cog with the <code>-r</code> flag (<code>cog -r Caddyfile</code>).\nAll the original Cog code is preserved, so I can run it again and again to regenerate the file.\nThis means that if I want to add a new redirect, I can edit the list and run Cog again.</p>\n<p>Cog is running a full version of Python, so I can rewrite the snippet to read the list of redirects <em>from an external file</em>.\nHere\u2019s another example:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"n\">alexwlchan.net</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"c\">#[[[cog\n  # import cog\n  # import json\n  #\n  # with open(\"redirects.json\") as in_file:\n  #     redirects = json.load(in_file)\n  # \n  # for r in redirects:\n  #     cog.outl(f\"redir {r['old_url']} {r['new_url']} permanent\")\n  #]]]</span>\n  redir /videos/crossness_flywheel.mp4 /files/2017/crossness_flywheel.mp4 permanent\n  redir /2021/12/2021-in-reading/ /2021/2021-in-reading/ permanent\n  redir /2022/12/print-sbt/ /til/2022/print-sbt/ permanent\n  <span class=\"c\">#[[[end]]]</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>This is a powerful change \u2013 unlike the original Caddyfile, it\u2019s easy to write scripts that insert entries in this external JSON file, and now I can programatically update this file.</p>\n<p>My scripts that are rearranging my URLs can populate <code>redirects.json</code>, then I only need to re-run Cog and I have a complete set of redirects in my Caddyfile.</p>\n<p>I usually run Cog with two flags:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>-r</code> writes the output back to the original file, and</li>\n<li><code>-c</code> adds a checksum to the end marker, like <code>[[[end]]] (sum: Rwh4n2CfQD)</code>.\nThis checksum allows Cog to detect if the output has been manually edited since it last processed the file \u2013 and if so, it will refuse to overwrite those changes.\nYou have to revert the manual edits or remove the checksum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also run Cog with a <code>--check</code> flag, which checks if a file is up-to-date.\nI\u00a0run this as a <a href=\"https://cog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#continuous-integration\">continuous integration task</a>, to make sure I\u2019ve updated my files properly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-i-like-cog\">Why I like Cog</h2>\n<p>What separates Cog from traditional templating engines like Jinja2 or Liquid is that it operates entirely in-place on the original file.\nUsually, you have a source template file and a build step which produce a separate output file, but with Cog, the source and the result are stored in the same document.\nStoring templates in separate files is useful for larger projects, but it\u2019s overkill for something like my Caddyfiles.</p>\n<p>Having everything in a single file makes it easy to resume working on a file managed with Cog.\nI\u00a0don\u2019t need to remember where I saved the build script or the template; I can operate directly on that single text file.\nIf I come back to this project in six months, the instructions for how the file is generated are right in front of me.</p>\n<p>The design also means that I\u2019m not locked into using Cog.\nAt any point, I could delete the Cog comments and still have a fully functional file.</p>\n<p>Cog isn\u2019t a replacement for a full-blown templating language, and it\u2019s not the right tool for larger projects \u2013 but it\u2019s indispensable for small amounts of automation.\nIf you\u2019ve never used it, I recommend <a href=\"https://cog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">giving it a look</a> \u2013 it\u2019s a handy tool to know.</p>\n\n    <p>[If the formatting of this post looks odd in your feed reader, <a href=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2026/cog-in-my-caddy/?ref=rss\">visit the original article</a>]</p>"

                "<p>How heritable is hair color? Well, if you\u2019re a redhead and you have an identical twin, they will definitely also be a redhead. But the age at which twins go gray seems to vary a bit based on lifestyle. And there\u2019s some randomness in where melanocytes end up on your skull when you\u2019re an embryo. And your twin might dye their hair! So the correct answer is, some large number, but less than 100%.</p>\n\n<p>OK, but check this out: Say I redefine \u201chair color\u201d to mean \u201chair color except ignoring epigenetic and embryonic stuff and pretending that no one ever goes gray or dyes their hair et cetera\u201d. Now, hair color is 100% heritable. Amazing, right?</p>\n\n<p>Or\u2014how heritable is IQ? The wise man answers, \u201cSome number between 0% or 100%, it\u2019s not that important, please don\u2019t yell at me.\u201d But whatever the number is, it depends on society. In our branch of the multiverse, some kids get private tutors and organic food and $20,000 summer camps, while other kids get dysfunctional schools and lead paint and summers spent drinking Pepsi and staring at glowing rectangles. These things surely have at least <em>some</em> impact on IQ.</p>\n\n<p>But again, watch this: Say I redefine \u201cIQ\u201d to be \u201cIQ in some hypothetical world where every kid got exactly the same school, nutrition, and parenting, so none of those non-genetic factors matter anymore.\u201d Suddenly, the heritability of IQ is higher. Thrilling, right? So much science.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to redefine stuff like this\u2026 that\u2019s not <em>wrong</em>. I mean, heritability is a pretty arbitrary concept to start with. So if you prefer to talk about heritability in some other world instead of our actual world, who am I to judge?</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, here\u2019s a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adz1187\">recent paper</a>:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/lifespan/title.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>I stress that this is a perfectly OK paper. I\u2019m picking on it mostly because it was published in Science, meaning\u2014like all Science papers\u2014it makes grand claims but is woefully vague about what those claims mean or what was actually done. Also, publishing in Science is morally wrong and/or makes me envious. So I thought I\u2019d try to explain what\u2019s happening.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s actually pretty simple. At least, now that I\u2019ve spent several hours reading the paper and its appendix over and over again, I\u2019ve now convinced myself that it\u2019s pretty simple. So, as a little pedagogical experiment, I\u2019m going to try to explain the paper three times, with varying levels of detail.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"explanation-1-the-very-extremely-high-level-picture\">Explanation 1: The very extremely high level picture</h2>\n\n<p>The normal way to estimate the heritability of lifespan is using twin data. Depending on what dataset you use, this will give 23-35%. This paper built a mathematical model that tries to simulate how long people <em>would</em> live in a hypothetical world in which no one dies from any non-aging related cause, meaning no car accidents, no drug overdoses, no suicides, no murders, and no (non-age-related) infectious disease. On that simulated data, for simulated people in a hypothetical world, heritability was 46-57%.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"commentary\">Commentary</h2>\n\n<p>Everyone seems to be interpreting this paper as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Aha! We thought the heritability of lifespan was 23-35%. But it turns out that it\u2019s around 50%. Now we know!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I understand this. Clearly, when the editors at Science chose the title for this paper, their goal was to lead you to that conclusion. But this is not what the paper says. What it says is this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We built a mathematical model of alternate universe in which nobody died from accidents, murder, drug overdoses, or infectious disease. In that model, heritability was about 50%.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"explanation-2-the-very-high-level-picture\">Explanation 2: The very high-level picture</h2>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start over. Here\u2019s figure 2 from the paper.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/lifespan/fig2.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>Normally, heritability is estimated from twin studies. The idea is that identical twins share 100% of their DNA, while fraternal twins share only 50%. So if some trait is more correlated among identical twins than among fraternal twins, that suggests DNA influences that trait. There are statistics that formalize this intuition. Given a dataset that records how long various identical and fraternal twins lived, these produce a heritability number.</p>\n\n<p>Two such traditional estimates appear as black circles in the above figures. For the Danish twin cohort, lifespan is estimated to be 23% heritable. For the Swedish cohort, it\u2019s 35%.</p>\n\n<p>This paper makes a \u201ctwin simulator\u201d. Given historical data, they fit a mathematical model to simulate the lifespans of \u201cnew\u201d twins. Then they compute heritability on this simulated data.</p>\n\n<p>Why calculate heritability on simulated data instead of real data? Well, their mathematical model contains an \u201cextrinsic mortality\u201d parameter, which is supposed to reflect the chance of death due to all non-aging-related factors like accidents, murder, or infectious disease. They assume that the chance someone dies from any of this stuff is constant over people, constant over time, and that it accounts for almost all deaths for people aged between 15 and 40.</p>\n\n<p>The point of building the simulator is that it\u2019s possible to <em>change</em> extrinsic mortality. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the purple curves in the above figure. For a range of different extrinsic mortality parameters, they simulate datasets of twins. For each simulated dataset, they estimate heritability just like with a real dataset.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the purple curves above nearly hit the black circles. This means that if they run their simulator with extrinsic mortality set to match reality, they get heritability numbers that line up with what we get from real data. That suggests their mathematical model isn\u2019t totally insane.</p>\n\n<p>If you decrease extrinsic mortality, then you decrease the non-genetic randomness in how long people live. So heritability goes up. Hence, the purple curves go up as you go to the left.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"intermission-on-science\">Intermission: On Science</h2>\n\n<p>My explanation of this paper relies on some amount of guesswork. For whatever reason, Science has decided that papers should contain almost no math, even when the paper in question is <em>about</em> math. So I\u2019m mostly working from an English description. But even that description isn\u2019t systematic. There\u2019s no place that clearly lays out all the things they did, in order. Instead, you get little hints, sort of randomly distributed throughout the paper. There\u2019s an appendix, which the paper confidently cites over and over. But if you actually read the appendix, it\u2019s just more disconnected explanations of random things except now with equations set in glorious Microsoft Work format.</p>\n\n<p>Now, in most journals, authors write everything. But Science has professional editors. Given that every single statistics-focused paper in Science seems to be like this, we probably shouldn\u2019t blame the authors of this one. (Other than for their decision to publish in Science in the first place.)</p>\n\n<p>I do wonder what those editors are doing, though. I mean, let me show you something. Here\u2019s the first paragraph where they start to actually explain what they actually did, from the first page:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/lifespan/paragraph.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>See that <em>h(t,\u03b8)</em> at the end? What the hell is that, you ask? That\u2019s a good question, because it was never introduced before this and is never mentioned again. I guess it\u2019s just supposed to be <em>f(t,\u03b8)</em>, which is fine. (I yield to none in my production of typos.) But if paying journals ungodly amounts of money brought us to this, of what use are those journals?</p>\n\n<p>Moving on\u2026</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"explanation-3-also-pretty-high-level-but-as-low-as-were-doing-to-go\">Explanation 3: Also pretty high level, but as low as we\u2019re doing to go</h2>\n\n<p>Probably most people don\u2019t need this much detail and should skip this section. For everyone else, let\u2019s start over one last time.</p>\n\n<p>The \u201cnormal\u201d way to estimate heritability is by looking at correlations between different kinds of twins. Intuitively, if the lifespans of identical twins are more correlated than the lifespans of fraternal twins, that suggests lifespan is heritable. And it turns out that one estimator for heritability is \u201ctwice the difference between the correlation among identical twins and the correlation among fraternal twins, all raised together.\u201d There are other similar estimators for other kinds of twins. These normally say lifespan is perhaps 20% and 35% heritable.</p>\n\n<p>This paper created an equation to model the probability a given person will die at a given age. The parameters of the equation vary from person to person, reflecting that some of us have DNA that predisposes us to live longer than others. But the idea is that the chances of dying are fairly constant between the ages of 15 and 40, after which they start increasing.</p>\n\n<p>This equation contains an \u201cextrinsic mortality\u201d parameter. This is meant to reflect the chance of death due to all non-aging related factors like accidents or murder, etc. They assume this is constant. (Constant with respect to people and constant over time.) Note that they don\u2019t actually look at any data on causes of death. They just add a constant risk of death that\u2019s shared by all people at all ages to the equation, and then they call this \u201cextrinsic mortality\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Now remember, different people are supposed to have different parameters in their probability-of-death equations. To reflect this, they fit a Gaussian distribution (bell curve) to the parameters with the goal of making it fit with historical data. The idea is that if the distribution over parameters were too broad, you might get lots of people dying at 15 or living until 120, which would be wrong. If the distribution were too concentrated, then you might get everyone dying at 43, which would also be wrong. So they find a good distribution, one that makes the ages people die in simulation look like the ages people actually died in historical data.</p>\n\n<p>Right! So now they have:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>An equation that\u2019s supposed to reflect the probability a given person dies at a given age.</li>\n  <li>A distribution over the parameters of that equation that\u2019s supposed to produce population-wide death ages that look like those in real historical data.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Before moving on, I remind you of two things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>They assume their death equation <em>entirely</em> determines the probability someone will die in a given year.</li>\n  <li>They assume that the shape of someone\u2019s death equation is <em>entirely</em> determined by genetics.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The event of a person dying at a given age is random. But the <em>probability</em> that this happens is assumed to be fixed and determined by genes and genes alone.</p>\n\n<p>Now they simulate different kinds of twins. To simulate identical twins, they just draw parameters from their parameter distribution, assign those parameters to two different people, and then let them randomly die according to their death equation. (Is this getting morbid?) To simulate fraternal twins, they do the same thing, except instead of giving the two twins identical parameters, they give them <em>correlated</em> parameters, to reflect that they share 50% of their DNA.</p>\n\n<p>How exactly do they create those correlated parameters? They don\u2019t explain this in the paper, and they\u2019re quite vague in the supplement. As far as I can tell they sample two sets of parameters from their parameter distribution such that the <em>parameters</em> are correlated at a level of 0.5.</p>\n\n<p>Now they have simulated twins. They can simulate them with different extrinsic mortality values. If they lower extrinsic mortality, heritability of lifespan goes up. If they lower it to zero, heritability goes up to around 50%.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"more-commentary\">More commentary</h2>\n\n<p>Almost all human traits are partly genetic and partly due to the environment and/or random. If you could change the world and reduce the amount of randomness, then <em>of course</em> heritability would go up. That\u2019s true for life expectancy just life for anything else. So what\u2019s the point of this paper?</p>\n\n<p>There is a point!</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Sure, obviously heritability would be higher in a world without accidents or murder. We don\u2019t need a paper to know that. But <em>how much</em> higher? It\u2019s impossible to say without modeling and simulating that other world.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Our twin datasets are really old. It\u2019s likely that non-aging-related deaths are lower now in the past, because we have better healthcare and so on. This means that the heritability of lifespan for people alive today may be larger than it was for the people in our twin datasets, some of whom were born in 1870. We won\u2019t know for sure until we\u2019re all dead, but this paper gives us a way to guess.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Have I mentioned that heritability depends on society? And that heritability changes when society changes? And that heritability is <a href=\"https://dynomight.net/heritable/\">just a ratio</a> and you should stop trying to make it be a non-ratio because only-ratio things cannot be non-ratios? This is a nice reminder.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Honestly, I think the model the paper built is quite clever. Nothing is perfect, but I think this is a pretty good run at the question of \u201chow high would the heritability of lifespan be if extrinsic mortality were lower.</p>\n\n<p>I only have two objections. The first is to the Science writing style. This is a paper describing a statistical model. So shouldn\u2019t there be somewhere in the paper where they explain exactly what they did, in order, from start to finish? Ostensibly, I think this is done in the left-hand column on the second page, just with little detail because Science is written for a general audience. But personally I think that description is the worst of all worlds. Instead of giving the high-level story in a coherent way, it throws random technical details at you without enough information to actually make sense of them. Couldn\u2019t the full story with the full details at least be in the appendix? I feel like this wasted hours of my time, and that if someone wanted to reproduce this work, they would have almost no chance of doing so from the description given. How have we as a society decided that we should take our \u201cbest\u201d papers and do this to them?</p>\n\n<p>But my main objection is this:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/lifespan/title-box.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>At first, I thought this was absurd. The fact that people die in car accidents is not a \u201cconfounding factor\u201d. And pretending that no one dies in a car accidents does not \u201caddress\u201d some kind of bias. That\u2019s just computing heritability in some other world. Remember, heritability is not some kind of Platonic form. It is an <em>observational statistic</em>. There is no such thing as \u201ctrue\u201d heritability, independent of the contingent facts of our world.\nBut upon reflection, I think they\u2019re trying to say something like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Heritability of intrinsic human lifespan is about 50% when extrinsic mortality is adjusted to be closer to modern levels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The problem is: I think this is\u2026 not true? Here are the actual heritability estimates in the paper, varying by dataset (different plots) the cutoff year (colors) and extrinsic mortality (x-axis).</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://dynomight.net/img/lifespan/full.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>When extrinsic mortality goes down, heritability goes up. So the obvious question is: What is extrinsic mortality in modern people?</p>\n\n<p>This is a tricky question, because \u201cextrinsic mortality\u201d isn\u2019t some simple observational statistic. It is a parameter in their model. (Remember, they never looked at causes of death.) So it\u2019s hard to say, but they seem to suggest that extrinsic mortality in modern people is 0.001 / year, or perhaps a bit less.</p>\n\n<p>The above figures have the base-10 logarithm of extrinsic mortality on the x-axis. And the base-10 logarithm of 0.001 is -3. But if you look at the curves when the x-axis is -3, the heritability estimates <em>are not 50%</em>. They\u2019re more like 35-45%, depending on the particular model and age cutoff.</p>\n\n<p>So here\u2019s my suggested title:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Heritability of intrinsic human lifespan is about 40% when extrinsic mortality is adjusted to modern levels, according to our simulation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There might be a reason I don\u2019t work at Science.</p>"

But I think in many contexts it\u2019s even more extreme, closer to 90/10 or even 99/1. <strong>If you get the \u201cmain thing\u201d right, you can get away with a lot of mistakes.</strong></p>\n<p>This principle holds in many other areas. When saving money, it doesn\u2019t matter if you save a few dollars by hunting for deals if you then buy a car or house that\u2019s on the edge of your budget. If you\u2019re writing, clearly expressing your point will make up for awkward grammar or other mistakes, but even beautiful prose is bad writing if it doesn\u2019t say what you mean. If you\u2019re trying to get fit, consistency and avoiding injury is far more important than finding the most efficient program or the best gear. And so on.</p>\n<h3>Identifying the \u201cmain thing\u201d</h3>\n<p><strong>How do you identify the main thing?</strong> This is a pretty deep question. I have written <em>extensively</em> about this when it comes to working in large tech companies: you can read <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/where-the-money-comes-from\"><em>Knowing where your engineer salary comes from</em></a>, or browse my posts tagged <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/tags/tech%20companies\">\u201ctech companies\u201d</a>.

It\u2019s not the main thing for life in general, or for being a fulfilled software craftsperson, and so on. Those two domains have completely different main things<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/rss.xml#fn-2\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the main thing seems too simple to be important. Plenty of software engineers think something like \u201cof course it\u2019s important to ship the project, but that only happens as a result of writing all the code\u201d, underrating the set of complex factors (both in code and elsewhere) that have to come together for a successful ship.</p>\n<p>The only general reliable method I know is to carefully look at cases of success and failure, and to identify what the successes had in common. <strong>Pay particular attention to successes or failures that surprise you.</strong> If you thought a project was going really well but the people who ran it weren\u2019t rewarded, or you thought a project was a complete disaster but it ended up being celebrated, that probably indicates that you\u2019re mistaken about what the \u201cmain thing\u201d is. Did someone get a staff promotion but you think they\u2019re terrible? Is someone beloved by senior leadership, but you can\u2019t see them doing anything that useful? Those people are probably getting the main thing right<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/rss.xml#fn-3\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<h3>It\u2019s hard to even try</h3>\n<p>The first step in correctly identifying the main thing is to <em>try</em>. In my experience, <strong>it is surprisingly hard to motivate yourself to focus on the main thing</strong>. It\u2019s much more natural to just jump into something that looks probably useful and start working immediately. Why is this?</p>\n<p>One obvious reason is that it just feels bad to sit around contemplating all the things you could focus on. It\u2019s much easier to account for your time - both to others and to yourself - if you look busy. What if you can\u2019t come up with anything, and you\u2019ve just wasted all the time you spent reflecting?</p>\n<p>Another, less obvious reason is that <strong>many people are afraid that they might not like the main thing</strong>. Recall my description of the main thing at tech companies:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cdelivering projects in order to increase shareholder value and make the ~2 layers of management above you happy\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lots of software engineers really hate that this is the most important thing. I wrote about this at length in <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/a-little-bit-cynical\"><em>Software engineers should be a little bit cynical</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/knowing-how-to-drive-the-car\"><em>You have to know how to drive the car</em></a>. If you don\u2019t like this goal at all, it\u2019s going to be tough to spend time thinking about how you can achieve it.</p>\n<p>In fact, I think <strong>it\u2019s actually more important to think about the \u201cmain thing\u201d if you hate it</strong>. This is why I\u2019m suspicious of \u201cdo what you love\u201d advice. If you love performance engineering but your company doesn\u2019t, I think you\u2019re better off doing it in your spare time and creating shareholder value at work, instead of trying to do as much performance engineering at work as you can.</p>\n<p>Half-assing creating shareholder value a few hours a day (and doing performance engineering the rest of the time) is more valuable than locking in to the wrong \u201cmain thing\u201d for ten hours a day. In my experience, it\u2019s also likely more burnout-resistant, since there\u2019s no faster path to burnout than working really hard on something that isn\u2019t valued.</p>\n<h3>Caution: the \u201cmain thing\u201d can rapidly change</h3>\n<p>In 2015, being easy to work with was the most important thing in many tech companies. If you were a pleasant colleague, you had to be <em>really</em> bad at other aspects of the job to face serious professional consequences. On the other hand, if you were abrasive and hard to work with, it didn\u2019t really matter how technically competent you were. Many engineers made successful careers by maximizing pleasantness: attending and hosting work social events, making friendly connections in different teams, and in general becoming a known engineer in the company.</p>\n<p>In 2026, it\u2019s still important to be pleasant. But now that tech companies are <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/good-times-are-over\">tightening their belts</a> and feeling more pressure to ship, the <em>most</em> important thing has shifted to being capable of <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-to-ship\">delivering projects</a>. If you\u2019re able to do that, it can go a long way towards redeeming a difficult personality. Like love, shipping <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2010%3A11-13&#x26;version=NKJV\">covers all sins</a>. This transition has been a bumpy ride for many software engineers.</p>\n<p>A lot of very pleasant \u201cknown engineers\u201d have been laid off in the last three years. I suppose the lesson here is something like this: <strong>even if you\u2019re doing great and are well-adapted to your niche, the environment can change and screw you over anyway</strong>. What can you do about it? If you\u2019ve spent a good chunk of your career developing one set of skills, you can\u2019t instantly transfer all that experience to a different set of skills when the environment changes. Maybe the underlying lesson is more like this: <strong>instead of over-specializing to a single niche, hedge your bets by being pretty good at multiple things</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Final thoughts</h3>\n<p>The lesson here is that <strong>you should spend a lot of time and effort trying to figure out what to focus on</strong>. In the extreme case, even spending half of your time doing this is worthwhile, if it puts you on the right track and you\u2019d otherwise be neglecting the main thing.</p>\n<p>This can seem pretty unintuitive. It feels safer and more productive to be doing <em>something</em>. But if you can force yourself to focus on the meta-question of what you ought to be doing - even if you don\u2019t like the answer - you\u2019ll be in a better position to achieve your goals.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>I write about this at length in <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-to-ship\"><em>How I ship projects at large tech companies</em></a>.</p>\n<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/rss.xml#fnref-1\">\u21a9</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>I leave filling out what those are as an exercise to the reader.</p>\n<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/rss.xml#fnref-2\">\u21a9</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-3\">\n<p>Or some people just get lucky!

One of the biggest problems in US drug development is that nobody has any incentive to spend money studying anything that can&#8217;t be patented, so supplements, certain small molecules, and new uses for old drugs never get a chance at FDA approval. Nicholas Reville discusses the obvious solution - that the government fund these as a public good. But he adds a few new things I didn&#8217;t know - first, that many of these can be justified as cost-saving (ie since the government pays for lots of health care, if a new trial lets them replace an expensive branded drug with a cheap off-patent alternative, they can recoup the cost of the study). And second, that this has already happened - in 2008, the National Eye Institute did a study like this to prove that a $50 older drug worked just as well as a $2000 newer drug, and saved the government $40 billion (&#8220;for context, NIH&#8217;s entire annual budget is ~$50B&#8221;). </p><p><strong>8: </strong><a href=\"https://justinkuiper.substack.com/p/the-vegetables-in-veggietales-are\">Are The Vegetables On VeggieTales Christian?</a>, the greatest thread in the history of forums, locked after . . .

I think Jan Leike&#8217;s post above does a better job balancing the reassuringness of the current evidence for the tractability of the infrahuman regime vs. the fact that we still don&#8217;t know what happens around highly-effective agency and superintelligence.</p><p><strong>32: </strong>60 Minutes recorded a segment on CECOT (El Salvador torture prison being used by Trump administration), then tried to suppress it (probably under indirect pressure from the administration), then changed its mind and showed it after all (<a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/links-for-february-2026/comment/210313277\">see here for discussion of whether this summary is fair</a>). I was heartened to see that someone <a href=\"https://www.thereset.news/p/breaking-heres-the-60-minutes-segment\">leaked it to Substacker Yashar Ali</a>.  I have a bias towards Streisand Effect-ing things that get suppressed like this, so I&#8217;ll link it here even though it got on 60 Minutes eventually anyway.</p><p><strong>33: </strong>Interesting as a way to build intuition for how Russia views the post-Soviet order, h/t <a href=\"https://x.com/mmjukic\">@MMJukic</a></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CfQa!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81b1a5f6-3a86-4ff9-a8a8-3ae40e71ddf6_1891x1228.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"Image\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"436.61538461538464\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CfQa!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81b1a5f6-3a86-4ff9-a8a8-3ae40e71ddf6_1891x1228.jpeg\" title=\"Image\" width=\"672\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Can&#8217;t believe he missed his chance to make Georgia Georgia.</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>34: </strong><a href=\"https://walzr.com/sf-identities\">List of every time someone said &#8220;I am a&#8230;&#8221;

These authors make a case that this is a reporting artifact. They ask both groups questions framed in psychiatric terms (&#8220;how is your mental health?&#8221;) and common-sensical terms (&#8220;how is your mood?&#8221;) - the liberals are more likely to endorse psychiatric descriptors, but both groups say their mood is the same. On the one hand, mental health isn&#8217;t just mood, and includes things like anxiety, hallucinations, etc. On the other, liberals say they have more depression than conservatives, and depression clearly is related to mood, so I think these people have done good work in showing that a bias exists that <em>could</em> explain all the data (even if we haven&#8217;t yet proven that it actually does).</p><p><strong>36: </strong>Indonesia has solved the conflict between density and single-family zoning by putting suburban neighborhoods <em>on top of</em> giant multi-story buildings (h/t <a

Obviously they stopped subsidizing their rides and raised prices until revenue &gt; cost, but how come the bezzlers thought they couldn&#8217;t do that, and why were they wrong? Andrew says the bezzle thesis had assumed that the government would crack down on the gig economy (it didn&#8217;t; Uber had good lobbyists and voters liked cheap foods and rides), and that there would be an infinite number of would-be competitors moving in to take market share as soon as Uber raised prices (there weren&#8217;t; Uber bullied everyone except Lyft out of the market, and Lyft and Uber would rather play nicely together than compete each other down to zero marginal profit). Oh well, I&#8217;m sure tech journalists are right about <em>everything else</em> being a giant Ponzi scheme that will inevitably collapse and reveal the entire tech industry to be an emperor without clothes.</p><p><strong>49: </strong><a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/larry-david-ellison-paramount-warner-bros-discovery-deal-hollywood.html\">Did you know</a>: Larry Ellison christened his yacht <em>Izanami</em> for a Shinto sea god, but had to hurriedly rename it after it was pointed out that, when spelled backwards, it becomes &#8220;I&#8217;m a Nazi&#8221;.

It goes: most crimes are plagued by reporting bias - if crime gets too bad, people simply don&#8217;t bother telling the police or other data-collecting bodies. The only crime that isn&#8217;t like this is murder - everyone notices a missing/dead human, and the police have to investigate all of them. So the only trustworthy statistic is the murder rate. Murders have gone down, but this is an artifact of improved trauma care saving many victims&#8217; lives; if trauma care has gotten twice as good, then the apparent number of murders will halve even for the same amount of crime. If you adjust the apparent murder rate for the improvement in trauma care, real murder rates may have doubled or even more. <a href=\"https://blog.outlandish.claims/p/higher-crime-areas-are-safer\">Aaron Zinger investigates at the bottom of this post</a> and disagrees; he says that murders averted by trauma care should show up as assaults, but that assaults have declined at almost the exact same rate as murders, suggesting a genuine decrease in people attacking one another, regardless of outcome - otherwise, it would be too much of a coincidence for the (trauma-care-induced) decline in the murder rate to exactly correlate with the (recording-bias-induced) decline in the assault rate. But how could improved trauma care <em>not</em> be biasing murder data collection? Aaron argues that would-be murderers have adjusted by trying harder to kill their victims (eg leaving them for dead vs. shooting them again to be sure). I&#8217;m a little skeptical of this (does the average murderer really calibrate their murder severity to the trauma care level?

That way, you&#8217;ll still never match with someone you don&#8217;t like (you can always prevent a match by rating them 0), but you have finer-grained control over things like &#8220;I&#8217;d be willing to date this person if they were super into me, but I&#8217;m not, like, champing at the bit to date them if they&#8217;re just vaguely okay with trying it.&#8221;</p><p><strong>59: </strong>The Old English word for paradise was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neorxnawang\">neorxnwang</a>. <em>Wang</em> means field (like in &#8220;Elysian Fields&#8221;?), but the meaning of <em>neorxn </em>remains mysterious.

So far, so good. I love that Anthropic is publicly hanging its hat on having no ads. That doesn\u2019t mean definitely never ads, but it does tie their hands substantially.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/claudeai/status/2019071118036942999\">They\u2019re running ads about it</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/MattBruenig/status/2019110324180308246\">including at the Superbowl</a>.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t love the ads themselves, although they are clearly funny. They depict a satirical potential future scenario where ads are integrated into a voiced AI conversation, and the AI\u2019s avatar is inserting ads in a ham-fisted way into the chat. Which, to be clear, OpenAI says it has no plans to do.</p>\n<p>As is standard in this type of advertisement, and the ad does not claim this is happening now or is specifically planned, nor does it even name any specific other company or product.</p>\n<p>The ads also quietly highlight, in the \u2018normal\u2019 response before the ads, a type of AI slop response endemic to certain of Anthropic\u2019s competitors, with very good tone to highlight why you shouldn\u2019t want that. That part is underappreciated.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/xuenay/status/2019318181287063682\">One can say that the ads are \u2018misleading</a>,\u2019 <a href=\"https://x.com/xuenay/status/2019318181287063682\">since</a> OpenAI swears up and down it won\u2019t be changing the text of its responses, and this ad implies that at some point an AI company will directly do that, and even though this is satire a regular person could come away with a false impression. And one could say this is a defection, in that it makes AI in general seem worse.</p>\n<p>In the context of a Super Bowl ad I think this is basically fair play, but I agree it doesn\u2019t meet my own epistemic standards and I\u2019d like to think Anthropic would also like to be held to high standards here. Thus, I\u2019m taking 10 points from Anthropic for the ads. But the whole thing is lighthearted and fun. It is 100% within <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/how-to-bounded-distrust\">Bounded Distrust</a> standards for a lighthearted ad at the Super Bowl.</p>\n<p>When I saw it I expected OpenAI to continue its principle of acting as if Anthropic and Claude don\u2019t exist to avoid alerting its customers to the fact that Anthropic and Claude exist.</p>\n<p>Instead, <a href=\"https://x.com/sjgadler/status/2019114346715181116\">this response from OpenAI CMO Kate Roush is quite disingenuous and bad.</a></p>\n<p>And then here is the full response from Sam Altman, and it\u2019s ugly:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/2019139174339928189\">Sam Altman</a> (CEO Anthropic): First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed.</p>\n<p>But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The claim that Anthropic\u2019s ad is \u2018clearly dishonest\u2019 is at least as dishonest as the actual claims in Anthropic\u2019s ad.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our most important principle for ads says that we won\u2019t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That sounds a lot like an admission that the main reason they aren\u2019t planning on running such ads is that they don\u2019t think they could get away with it. I suspect Fijo Simo would jump at the chance if she thought it would work. I don\u2019t think it is at all unreasonable to expect ad integration into voice conversations within a few years.</p>\n<p>Will the users reject such ads? It will cost trust, but ads do cost trust, quite a lot. At minimum, I expect ads to get more obtrusive and integrated over time, and for the free service to increasingly maximize for ad revenue opportunities, even if we successfully retain some formal distinction between model outputs and ads, and even if we also don\u2019t let who is advertising impact model training. As Altman says himself they are \u2018trying to solve a different problem\u2019 and we should ultimately expect that to end in similar behaviors to those we see from Google or Meta.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/hamandcheese/status/2019145902200443253\">Samuel Hammond</a>: The bigger issue is trust and track record. Sam has given the world no reason to trust his red lines on ads or anything else. The line will shift the moment he decides it&#8217;s useful, with some just so story to retcon his past statements.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/David_Kasten/status/2019147202074202528\">dave kasten</a>: The problem here is that Sam&#8217;s trying to lie about the experience of ad-supported products that everyone in America&#8217;s had over the past 20 years, and he knows it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I would also ask, this depicts a voice mode. If you presume that ads are coming to voice mode, how exactly are you going to implement that, that is so different from what is depicted here, beyond perhaps including a verbal labeling of the ad?</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sam Altman: I guess it\u2019s on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren\u2019t real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I try to be calibrated, and this broadside was still was a large negative update on Altman and OpenAI, including on their prospects for acting responsibly on safety.</p>\n<p>My read of this is, essentially, that Sam Altman hates Anthropic but they were using the strategy of \u2018we are the only game in town, don\u2019t give the competitor oxygen, if we don\u2019t look at them they will go away,\u2019 which was working in consumer but not in enterprise, and here they got goaded into trying a new plan.</p>\n<blockquote><p>More importantly, we believe everyone deserves to use AI and are committed to free access, because we believe access creates agency. More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do. (If you want to pay for ChatGPT Plus or Pro, we don&#8217;t show you ads.)</p>\n<p>Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people. We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can\u2019t pay for subscriptions.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Is there a legitimate defense of serving ads in ChatGPT, in spite of all the downsides?</p>\n<p>Yes, of course there is. I\u2019m sad about it, but I get it. I can see both sides here. The main reason I am sad about it is that I do not expect it to stop at OpenAI\u2019s currently announced policies, any more than Google or Meta kept to their initial rules.</p>\n<p>But seriously, \u2018an expensive product to rich people?\u2019 This feels already way more deceptive than anything in the ad. Only the \u2018rich\u2019 can pay $20/month or use an API?</p>\n<blockquote><p>Maybe even more importantly: Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI\u2014they block companies they don&#8217;t like from using their coding product (including us), they want to write the rules themselves for what people can and can&#8217;t use AI for, and now they also want to tell other companies what their business models can be.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yes, Anthropic blocks direct competitors from using their products to compete with Anthropic. And OpenAI blocked Anthropic right back in retaliation. Anthropic also restricted use of Claude Code tokens that you earn via subsidized subscription from being used for third party services, but those services are free to use the API.</p>\n<p>Altman is trying to conflate that with Anthropic telling regular users what they can and can\u2019t do, which both companies do in roughly equal measure, unless you count that OpenAI offers a more generous free service.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are committed to broad, democratic decision making in addition to access. We are also committed to building the most resilient ecosystem for advanced AI. We care a great deal about safe, broadly beneficial AGI, and we know the only way to get there is to work with the world to prepare.</p>\n<p>One authoritarian company won&#8217;t get us there on their own, to say nothing of the other obvious risks. It is a dark path.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Seriously, where the hell did this come from? One \u2018authoritarian\u2019 company?</p>\n<blockquote><p>As for our Super Bowl ad: it\u2019s about builders, and how anyone can now build anything.</p>\n<p>We are enjoying watching so many people switch to Codex. There have now been 500,000 app downloads since launch on Monday, and we think builders are really going to love what\u2019s coming in the next few weeks. I believe Codex is going to win.</p>\n<p>We will continue to work hard to make even more intelligence available for lower and lower prices to our users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I look forward to your own ad (it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s public yet), and from what I can tell Codex and Claude Code are both excellent products, and if I was doing more serious coding I would do more serious testing of Codex.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This time belongs to the builders, not the people who want to control them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Saying by very clear implication here that Anthropic \u2018wants to control\u2019 builders is, again, far more disingenuous than anything Anthropic has done here. You bring shame upon yourself, sir.</p>\n<p>I presume this reaction is what the poker players call tilt.</p>\n<p>Seeing this response to a humorous ad that does not even name OpenAI?

I do think the rapid acceleration reflects the reality that OpenAI, Anthropic and Google have AIs that can often one shot remarkably complex tasks, and this ability is rapidly growing.</p>\n<p>As seems likely on first principles, <a href=\"https://x.com/tobyordoxford/status/2018986170324054064\">AI agents have declining hazard rates as tasks get longer</a>. Not failing yet suggests ability to continue to not fail on a particular task and attempted implementation. That means that your chances for tasks longer than your 50% success horizon are better than you would otherwise expect from a constant hazard rate, and chances for shorter tasks are worse.

I agree that the name AGI should \u2018naturally\u2019 refer to a set that includes Claude Opus 4.5 plus Claude Code, but we have collectively decided that yes, we should hold the term AGI to a higher standard humans don\u2019t meet, and for practical purposes I endorse this.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/peterwildeford/status/2019225474917101698\">Kimi K2.5 comes into the Epoch Capabilities Index (ECI) as the top open model</a>.

I\u2019ll share his Twitter thread below, everything here will be highly familiar to my regular readers.</p>\n<p>The form of what Bengio is doing here can be valuable. The targets are people who are less immersed in this from day to day, where we desperately need them to wake up to the basics, which requires they be presented in this kind of institutionally credible way. I get that.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Yoshua Bengio: \u200bIn 2025:</p>\n<p>1&#x20e3; Capabilities continued advancing rapidly, especially in coding, science, and autonomous operation.</p>\n<p>2&#x20e3; Some risks, from deepfakes to cyberattacks, shifted further from theoretical concerns to real-world challenges.</p>\n<p>3&#x20e3; Many safety measures improved, but remain fallible. Developers increasingly implement multiple layers of safeguards to compensate.</p>\n<p>On capabilities: AI systems continue to improve significantly.<br />\nLeading models now achieve gold-medal performance on the International Mathematical Olympiad. AI coding agents can complete 30-minute programming tasks with 80% reliability\u2014up from 10-minute tasks a year ago.<br />\nBut capabilities are also \u201cjagged:\u201d the same model may solve complex problems yet fail at some seemingly simple tasks.</p>\n<p>These capabilities are increasingly translating into real-world impact.<br />\nAt least 700 million people now use leading AI systems weekly. In the US, use of AI has spread faster than that of computers and the internet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/Yoshua_Bengio/status/2018673260334825577\">Yoshua Bengio</a>: However, new capabilities pose risks. The report assesses 8 emerging risks:</p>\n<p>Misuse:<br />\n\u2192 AI-generated content &amp; criminal activity<br />\n\u2192 Influence &amp; manipulation<br />\n\u2192 Cyberattacks<br />\n\u2192 Biological &amp; chemical risks</p>\n<p>Malfunctions:<br />\n\u2192 Reliability issues<br />\n\u2192 Loss of control</p>\n<p>Systemic risks:<br />\n\u2192 Labor market impacts<br />\n\u2192 Risks to human autonomy</p>\n<p>Since the last Report, we have seen new evidence of many emerging risks.<br />\nFor example, AI-generated content has become extremely realistic, and more useful for fraud, scams, and non-consensual intimate imagery. There is growing evidence that AI systems help malicious actors carry out cyberattacks.</p>\n<p>There is little evidence of overall impacts on labour markets so far, though early-career workers in some AI-exposed occupations have seen declining employment compared with late 2022.</p>\n<p>Wider adoption is also raising new challenges.<br />\nFor example, this year we discuss early evidence on how \u201cAI companions\u201d, which are now used by tens of millions of people, may affect people\u2019s emotions and social life.</p>\n<p>Even areas of uncertainty carry risks that warrant attention.<br />\nFor example, in 2025 multiple companies added safeguards after pre-deployment testing could not rule out the possibility that new models could assist novices seeking to develop biological weapons.</p>\n<p>Many technical safeguards are improving. For example, models hallucinate less and it is harder to elicit dangerous responses. These safeguards inform institutional risk management approaches. For example, 12 companies published or updated Frontier AI Safety Frameworks in 2025\u2014more than double the prior year.</p>\n<p>However, safeguards remain imperfect.<br />\nAttackers can still often find ways to evade them relatively easily.<br />\nOne initiative crowdsourced over 60,000 successful attacks against state-of-the-art models. When given 10 attempts, testers can still generate harmful responses about half the time.</p>\n<p>Because no single safeguard reliably prevents misuse or malfunctions, developers are converging on &#8220;defence-in-depth.&#8221;<br />\nThis means layering multiple measures\u2014model-level training, input/output filters, monitoring, access controls, and governance\u2014so that if one fails, others may still prevent harm.</p>\n<p>With all the noise around AI, I hope this Report provides policymakers, researchers, and the public with the reliable evidence they need to make more informed choices about how to develop and deploy this critical technology.<br />\nThis year, we also have a ~20-page \u201cExtended Summary for Policymakers\u201d to make our key findings more accessible.</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, while I wouldn\u2019t go as far as Oliver, I also think this is highly valid:</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/ohabryka/status/2018745491727737052\">Oliver Habryka</a>: I haven&#8217;t had time to read this report in detail, but this kind of report has a long history of being the result of some kind of weird respectability politics that tends to result in excluding almost all research.</p>\n<p>And indeed, this report does not include a single mention of Substack,<br />\n<a href=\"http://X.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://X.com</a>, AlignmentForum or LessWrong. Come on, this is just some kind of weird farce at this point. It&#8217;s clear that a huge fraction of the research in the field is happening on those platforms. You can&#8217;t claim to be comprehensive if you systematically exclude those sources.</p>\n<p>I find it very sad to see people who seem mostly earnestly motivated to do good, end up feeling comfortable doing these really quite distorting presentations for what (I think) must be some kind of political status game?</p>\n<p>This was already a huge issue in last year&#8217;s report, and it seems mildly worse in this year&#8217;s report from what I can tell. It&#8217;s really frustrating.</p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s of course a huge driver for polarizing AI safety and adjacent topics. This is very much the kind of thing that has historically contributed to radicalization against the left which much of the broad population perceives to be some expert class that considers all intellectual contributions that are not priest-approved beneath them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/bshlgrs/status/2018759782505807918\">Buck Shlegeris</a>: &gt; And it&#8217;s of course a huge driver for polarizing AI safety and adjacent topics.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t think of an interpretation of this sentence that I agree with. You&#8217;re saying that this report contributes to polarization of AIS by only citing Arxiv rather than blog posts?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ohabryka/status/2018764959682076933\">Oliver Habryka</a>: Yep! Scientism (as in, treating science as a ritualized process by an anointed priesthood) is a major driver of polarization and IMO quite bad.</p>\n<p>I think this e.g. played a pretty huge role in COVID, and generally plays a big role in preference falsification.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/michael_nielsen/status/2018828229545783673\">Michael Nielsen</a>: Something I&#8217;ve often noticed in policy circles: a tendency to defer to what is within the Overton window of power, even when it&#8217;s clear that is not reality. Maybe that&#8217;s good policy, I don&#8217;t know. But it&#8217;s a terrible way to make progress on understanding reality.</p>\n<p>Like it or not, LW and the AF and adjacent fora have been a significant part of how humanity arrived at its current thinking about AI safety. A &#8220;comprehensive review&#8221; which omits this is not comprehensive</p></blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s not a crazy idea to have a report that is, essentially, \u2018here is how we present Respectable Facts From Respectable Sources so that you at least know something is happening at all, and do the best we can without providing any attack surface.\u2019 But don\u2019t confuse it with the state of AI.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">In Other AI News</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/2018813527780463027\">In a rare reverse move, OpenAI hires Anthropic\u2019s Dylan Scandinaro</a> as their new head of preparedness. I don\u2019t know much about him but all comments on the hire I\u2019ve seen have been strongly positive.</p>\n<p>I do think the potshots at Altman for refusing to say what we are preparing for are fair. We are preparing largely to ensure that AI does not kill everyone, and yes I am sleeping marginally better with Dylan hired but I would sleep better still if Altman was still willing to say out loud what this is about.</p>\n<p>Even more than that, I would sleep well if I was confident Dylan would be respected, given the resources and authority he needs and allowed to do the job, rather than being concerned he just got hired to teach Defense Against The Dark Arts.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/2018813527780463027/history\">Sam Altman</a>: I am extremely excited to welcome @dylanscand to OpenAI as our Head of Preparedness.</p>\n<p>Things are about to move quite fast and we will be working with extremely powerful models soon.

He is by far the best candidate I have met, anywhere, for this role. He has his work cut out for him for sure, but I will sleep better tonight. I am looking forward to working with him very closely to make the changes we will need across our entire company.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/HumanHarlan/status/2018886793966555340\">Harlan Stewart</a>: In this tweet, \u201censure we can continue to deliver tremendous benefits\u201d is a euphemism for trying to make sure their R&amp;D doesn\u2019t \u201cdestroy every human in the universe,\u201d as Sam has warned it could.</p>\n<p>Be clear about the danger and about your plan or lack thereof for addressing it!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/_NathanCalvin/status/2018808010672599157\">Nathan Calvin</a>: &#8220;We will be working with extremely powerful models soon. This will require commensurate safeguards&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is true. It also seems at odds with OAI being one of the main funders of a Superpac that tries to destroy any politician who proposes laws to require such safeguards.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, you know who\u2019s much worse on AI safety? DeepSeek.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/davidmanheim/status/2018990220029436245\">David Manheim</a>: &#8220;In a podcast released on Sunday, former DeepSeek researcher Tu Jinhao said&#8230; &#8216;All the computational resources are being spent training AI models, with little left to spend on safety work'&#8221;</p>\n<p>That certainly explains model cards with no info on safety tests.</p></blockquote>\n<p>DeepSeek has a revealed preference on AI safety, which is that they are against it.</p>\n<p>Humans are subject to a lot of RLHF, so this makes a lot of sense.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/repligate/status/2017361125495709829\">j\u29c9nus</a>: While this there are important caveats and nuances, a very important thing is that over the past few years I&#8217;ve updated towards *RLed* LLMs being more psychologically human-like than I expected on priors, which has deep implications about the nature of intelligence imo.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/viemccoy/status/2017361492241486097\">@viemccoy</a>: I think RL makes them human shaped because of rewards but we could use different rewards to get different shapes</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/repligate/status/2017361761809375653\">j\u29c9nus</a>: i think some of the things that are rewarded that make them humanlike are pretty instrumentally convergent to reward / universally incentivized though.

What is strange is that one could think of this as an \u2018unpopular opinion.\u2019</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/random_walker/status/2018666383790272736\">Arvind Narayanan</a>: Unpopular opinion: companies continue to shove AI into everything because from their perspective, it&#8217;s going better than we&#8217;d like to admit.</p>\n<p>One example is Google&#8217;s AI overviews. I was one of the people loudly complaining about it in its early days when it was in the news for telling people to put glue on pizza. But the quality has improved gradually yet dramatically, and these days I find it pretty useful.</p>\n<p>I think our disdain for companies &#8220;shoving AI down our throats&#8221; is largely a selection effect \u2014 when one of these AI integrations is new and experimental, we tend to notice, but over time the kinks get worked out, it becomes a part of our workflow, and we stop noticing it.

As per usual, the main numbers are his takes, the nested notes are me.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There will not be One Big Model, we will also use smaller specialized models.\n<ol>\n<li>Increasingly I keep being surprised how much this is not happening. Sometimes you need a smaller model, and you pick up a Kimi-K2 or Gemini Flash or Flash Lite, but you\u2019re calling smaller generalized models.</li>\n<li>I do think it is surprising that smaller specialized models have been found not to be worth training, but that is what we have seen.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Software, scaffolds, harnesses, APIs, affordances etc., are where the rubber hits the road.\n<ol>\n<li>The scaffolding is super important but that doesn\u2019t mean the model isn\u2019t.</li>\n<li>A sufficiently good model can find and assemble its own scaffolding.</li>\n<li>The quality of the big model should continue to matter a lot, but there will be a growing share of tasks \u2018under the difficulty water line\u2019 where you don\u2019t need a quality model because it is so easy.</li>\n<li>The exception is that the best models seem better at resisting attacks.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Increasingly, the focus will be on collective and industrial intelligence. Social technologies matter hugely and are often ignored by technologists who fail to zoom out.\n<ol>\n<li>I continue to think this fundamentally misunderstands intelligence.</li>\n<li>Not that the social aspects aren\u2019t important, but they\u2019re not the central thing.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Here, there is still a lot to work out, and I expect high complementarity with human workers for at least the next decade.\n<ol>\n<li>I hope he\u2019s right, but a decade is a long time.</li>\n<li>Complementarity with workers by default starts quickly being complementarity with relatively few workers.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>You just keep going up layers of abstraction, and humans continue steering complex multi-agent systems, until fixed costs bite. Part of the reason why humans always stay at the top of the chain is that many decisions made are normative\u2026. This requires inherently human inputs.\n<ol>\n<li>Sigh. The AIs will be better at normative decisions, too.</li>\n<li>There are no inherently human inputs, only skill issues.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Remember, this doesn\u2019t violate the basic fact that market-coordinated economic activity is downstream of consumer and business demand.\n<ol>\n<li>Demand can come from a lot of places and there is no reason to assume that demand will remain ultimately human, indeed this probably won\u2019t hold.</li>\n<li>Market-coordinated is making a lot of assumptions. Watch out.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Accounts of full disempowerment assume democracy disappears, but I don&#8217;t think all roads lead to autocracy.\n<ol>\n<li>Most roads lead to neither autocracy nor democracy, because the humans are no longer in charge.</li>\n<li>All of this keeps assuming a pure kind of \u2018humans are unique, in control, own all the things and are on top of the food chain\u2019 and there\u2019s only so many times I can point out you should not be assuming or even expecting this.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>As the world goes through these transitions, we will probably continue to see many commentators gloss over the vast benefits and improvements humanity will see.\n<ol>\n<li>Yes.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>If we allow sufficient deployment of technology, robots, AI and so on, while ensuring the supply of energy, housing, and other important inputs isn\u2019t constrained to a strangling degree, then the production of many goods and services will go down in price.\n<ol>\n<li>Hey, if we\u2019re not constraining the supply of energy and housing to a strangling degree then we don\u2019t even need the technology, robots or AI.</li>\n<li>I mean, we do need them, just not to cause production costs to go down.</li>\n<li>They are a rather nice bonus, though, and can overcome quite a lot constraint.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>But this doesn&#8217;t justify regressive populist policies or a &#8216;pause&#8217;\u2026. Opposing AI or technological progress is a particularly nasty version of degrowth: it kills people, it entrenches poverty, and generally locks in all sorts of tragedies for the benefit of a comfortable elite who can easily thrive with the status quo.\n<ol>\n<li>If a policy is both regressive and populist, something went wrong.</li>\n<li>Equating not maximally advancing AI to \u2018killing people\u2019 or to \u2018degrowth\u2019 is like many moral claims that ignore action-inaction distinctions and ignore insufficiently proven consequences, in that they justify monstrosities. Examples are left as an exercise to the reader.</li>\n<li>No, this does not relatively benefit \u2018a comfortable elite,\u2019 and note the more popular mirror concern that AI will cause massive inequality.</li>\n<li>To say it is worse than degrowth boggles the mind and I can\u2019t even.</li>\n<li>That\u2019s not to say that I support actively slowing things down at this time, but I find this type of rhetoric infuriating and at best unhelpful.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>In parallel to the economic transformations, the world of governance evolves too. I think what democracy will look like and how it will be exercised will look very different from today&#8217;s decaying systems. But the core principles will either not change, or evolve in sophistication.\n<ol>\n<li>I don\u2019t see any reason other than optimism to have this be the baseline, even if you expect far less High Weirdness and existential danger than I do.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>In the future, I expect politics and governance to be an increasingly important component of people&#8217;s lives: many will care deeply about how things are organised and managed at the local or national or international level.\n<ol>\n<li>I don\u2019t expect those people to have any meaningful say in the matter.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>(split off from his #12) Many will devote their lives to all sorts of artistic, heroic, spiritual, and social pursuits. A proliferation of subcultures and micro worlds of wonder. This isn&#8217;t &#8220;nursery for adults&#8221; but what many people already do outside of work if they can afford it. I think people can find plenty of meaning in activities that don\u2019t require being &#8220;depended on&#8221; in an \u2018economic\u2019 sense. If the cancer researcher cares more about being depended on for status and meaning than curing cancer, then I\u2019m afraid they\u2019re in the wrong. I think we&#8217;ll look back at such frames with disgust.\n<ol>\n<li>One could say the opposite. That the idea of seeking status and meaning in ways that are not being beneficial to others is not a great path to go down.</li>\n<li>Everyman standing up at meeting meme, I think it is good that status and meaning can be gained by curing cancer.</li>\n<li>I do not think meaning will be so easy to fake at scale.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>And I do think status games will continue, albeit in a much more diverse ecosystem of sub cultures and geographies. But again: always has been. \u2026 I think the gap between what will effectively be \u2018the rich\u2019 and the \u2018ultra rich\u2019 will matter less to people, but the gap in status and social hierarchies will matter more. Remember how much Elon wanted to be perceived as very good at Path of Exile 2?\n<ol>\n<li>The gap between rich and ultra rich is already kind mostly pointless, in the worlds Seb is imagining degrees of material wealth are not so important.</li>\n<li>Elon has a problem, more so than most people.</li>\n<li>Status and social hierarchies matter largely because they gate things people want, not inherently because status and hierarchy. If people can get those things from AI without status, I\u2019m not convinced people care as much.</li>\n<li>There is still room for status competition, but they look more \u2018winner take all\u2019 or at least \u2018most people take none\u2019 and that has trouble scaling properly.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Ultimately, AGI will bring about huge positive transformations for the world, many of which are hard to describe: could anyone at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution have told you about video games, eye surgery, deep sea diving, street tacos, and mRNA vaccines? I\u2019m not saying this because I think safety is not important (it is, very much so!) or because I think everything will be rosy and fine. But I think there are strong incentives to point out all the ways things may or will go wrong, and few good accounts of the positives apart from bland corporate slop. So I think it\u2019s important to continue to make the case for this important technology.\n<ol>\n<li>Conditional on nothing going horribly wrong, yes. Much upside ahead.</li>\n<li>However I don\u2019t know where this meme of \u2018all the incentive is to point out the downsides\u2019 is coming from. Or I kind of do, but it\u2019s wrong. People have lots of incentive to hype the good stuff, and warning about the downsides that matter mostly give you a Cassandra problem.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>AGI will in many ways not be so different, there is much to learn from history, you can\u2019t use \u2018this time is different\u2019 as a justification for things.\n<ol>\n<li>This time is different.</li>\n<li>This is not a hand-wave style statement.</li>\n<li>This justifies a lot of things, although one must be precise.</li>\n<li>Sure, there\u2019s still ways to learn from history, history is important, but so many of the reasons for that history do not apply here, and it\u2019s causing a lot of poor assumptions, and this list includes examples.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Quest for Sane Regulations</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/sriramk/status/2019402423157301389\">Sriram Krishnan and Michael Kratsios head off to the AI Impact Summit in India</a>.

But in the mean time, we are extremely dependent on good industry self-governance norms, and norms of individuals being prepared act on their sense of responsibility. Moves that degrade those norms are dangerous, and IMO need to be reputationally punished.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/tszzl/status/2018109423789781496\">Roon doubles down on his defense here</a>, and I updated against his position, as he points out that \u2018skilled operators\u2019 can get around it. In that case, what\u2019s even the point?</p>\n<p>Praise be to Goodfire for letting Liv say that she had to sign the agreement, and for removing the agreements once brought to light.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/ericho_goodfire/status/2018037693226344499\">Eric Ho</a> (CEO Goodfire): We met as a team today and have decided to remove non-disparagement clauses from all employment agreements past and present effective immediately.</p>\n<p>For context, we had a non disparagement (which is standard for vc-backed startups) that had carve-outs for whistleblowers, so there was nothing that prevented employees from commenting on anything unlawful. It was boilerplate from our law firm when incorporating.</p>\n<p>Goodfire is an early stage startup and the majority of our energy goes towards our mission of understanding AI systems, but we\u2019re always looking for ways to improve.

I wasn\u2019t expecting \u2013 and did not want \u2013 my tweet to get this level of attention, and really just wanted to have this be over. However, this characterisation feels unfair, and so I feel obliged to say something.</p>\n<p>To start, I am very glad you\u2019ve lifted the non-disparagements. I think not having non-disparagements should be a normative expectation in AI safety.</p>\n<p>I also do need to take some responsibility: I should have read my employment contract closely. If I had, I would not have signed it. I was really excited to work at an AI safety organisation, and honestly, it never occurred to me that non-disparagements would still be used after the previous scandals. Still, I\u2019m responsible for signing a contract with terms I should have objected to.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m glad you\u2019re welcoming feedback now when there\u2019s public attention. However, I feel misrepresented by the implicit message that this is the first time you\u2019re getting this feedback. I raised this issue extensively internally. Further, I was asked to sign a new confidential non-disparagement agreement, which would have prevented me from raising this publicly. If this had happened, it seems to me that Goodfire would not have had the public feedback which led to this being changed.</p>\n<p>I also feel misrepresented by your comments on whistleblowing exceptions. While the non-disparagement did have some exceptions, they were the minimum legally required exceptions for it to be enforceable, and would not have extended to safety whistleblowing (which was also not corrected when I raised it).</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t want to get into an argument about this on twitter but it\u2019s very important to me to not feel misrepresented. All of this is honestly very stressful for me, and I\u2019m hoping I can take a break from twitter following this.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ohabryka/status/2018060273949856128\">Oliver Habryka</a>: Given this info I would consider Eric\u2019s tweet to be quite deceptive.</p>\n<p>Many people read his tweet as implying the terms were just boilerplate, whereas from this it seems clear they were intentional, and most importantly, were in many cases negotiated to be secret.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Constitutional Conversation</h4>\n\n\n<p>OpenAI\u2019s Boaz Barak responds extensively on <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/constitution\">Claude&#8217;s constitution</a>, often comparing it to <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/on-openais-model-spec-20\">OpenAI&#8217;s model spec</a>. He finds a lot to like, and is concerned in places it is reasonable to be concerned. Boaz affirms that he thinks there is more need for hard rules than is reflected here, in part to allow some collective \u2018us\u2019 to debate and decide on them, after which we should follow the laws. Whereas I think that Anthropic is right that we want something like a constitution here exactly to do what constitutions do best, which is to constrain ourselves in advance from passing the wrong laws.</p>\n<p>I was concerned that to learn Boaz shares Jan Leike\u2019s view that <a href=\"https://aligned.substack.com/p/alignment-is-not-solved-but-increasingly-looks-solvable\">alignment increasingly \u2018looks solvable.\u2019</a> I notice that this means my update of \u2018oh no they\u2019re underestimating the problem\u2019 was larger than my update of \u2018oh maybe I am overestimating the problem.\u2019</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://freesystems.substack.com/p/the-enlightened-absolutists\">Andy Hall is exactly right</a> that the greatest problem with <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/constitution\">Claude\u2019s constitution</a> is that it is not a constitution, in the sense that Anthropic can amend it at will and it lacks separation of powers. The good news is that the constitution being known makes that a costly action, but more work needs to be done on that front. As for a potential separation of powers, I have sad news about your ability to meaningfully counterbalance the AI, or for other parties to make any arrangements with AI self-enforcing, and as I noted in my review of the Constitution I believe it already downplays the risk of diffusion of steering capability, and like so many I see Andy as worried too much about the fact that men are not angels, rather than what AIs will be.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rhetorical Innovation</h4>\n\n\n<p>Max Harms replies to <a href=\"https://benthams.substack.com/p/against-if-anyone-builds-it-everyone\">Bentham\u2019s Bulldog\u2019s review</a> of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4iwvCtW\"><em>If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n<p>Dean Ball is right that <a href=\"https://x.com/deanwball/status/2017331375020310757\">it is deeply unwise to be a general \u2018technology skeptic\u2019</a> or opposed to any and all AI uses.

The question is the correct magnitude of our reaction, and ensuring it is directed towards the right targets and we learn the right lessons.</p>\n<p>For AI, there are a wide range of sources of moral panic, and they cover all quadrants.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unjustified overreaction: Water usage.</li>\n<li>Justified overreaction: LLM psychosis.</li>\n<li>Unjustified underreaction: LLMs helping kids do homework.</li>\n<li>Justified underreaction: LLMs might kill everyone.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Aligning a Smarter Than Human Intelligence is Difficult</h4>\n\n\n<p>The Claude Constitution is great but <a href=\"https://x.com/ohabryka/status/2018940337956458928\">what we have not done is experiment with other very different constitutions</a> that share the constitutional nature instead of the model spec nature, and compared results.

If OpenAI is worth $5 trillion except when it kills everyone then it worth\u2026 $5 trillion, in a rather dramatic market failure, and if you force it to buy the insurance then the insurance, if priced correctly, never pays out meaningful dollars so it costs $0.</p>\n<p>This<a href=\"https://ai-frontiers.org/articles/ai-catastrophe-bonds-extreme-risk-tradeable\"> works better for merely catastrophic risks</a>, where the money would still be meaningful and collectable, except now you have the opposite problem that no one wants to sell you the insurance and it would be too expensive. Daniel Reti and Gabriel Weil propose solving via catastrophe bonds that pay out in a sufficiently epic disaster.</p>\n<p>Such bonds carry a premium over expected risk levels, so it isn\u2019t a free action, but it seems better than the current method of ignoring the issue entirely.
