Over the years, some of that content keeps showing up. I keep forwarding the same links to the same articles; I get asked the same questions at Q&amp;A. I&#8217;ve decided to synthesize the advice into a single artifact.</p>\n<p>My writing style has historically been nice and introverted. I don&#8217;t tell you what to do; I tell you a story, usually about my experience. If you want, you can derive lessons from this story, but I&#8217;m not insistent that you learn anything. I just want to tell you a story.</p>\n<p>I suspect humans need more direction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rands_Cheat_Sheet_1.pdf\">Download PDF Rands Cheat Sheet #1 &#8212; 1:1s</a></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fond of 1:1s not just because they are immediately useful meetings, but because they were one of the first leadership topics I wrote about, where the response from the Internet instantly demonstrated a clear hunger for leadership mentorship. It was the beginning of a literary love affair with documenting leadership habits I found to be obvious, but that were not obvious to everyone. I have just explained the primary reason you are reading this sentence right now. Hi.</p>\n<p>Another goal for the cheat sheet is to make Rands Ltd more accessible elsewhere. Blogs make no sense on platforms like Instagram or TikTok, and I am unlikely to start filming 37-second shorts, but I am going to see how tight, well-designed, and digestible content fares elsewhere. We&#8217;ll see.</p>\n<p>There are two definitions of cheating out there right now: one definition is akin to hacks, clever approaches to beginning to solve a complex issue. The second is dishonestly or unfairly acting to gain an advantage. A non-goal for this cheat sheet is the latter. The fact that I&#8217;ve distilled decades of knowledge into an easy-to-read one-pager doesn&#8217;t make the act of scheduling, preparing, and running a 1:1 any easier. If you don&#8217;t do the work, you won&#8217;t learn the lesson.</p>"
