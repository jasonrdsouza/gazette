And these results seem to express the biases we should expect given that most of my respondents are men, and that women initiate most breakups, namely blaming A more and B less. In fact, it isn&#8217;t clear to me that we see much more than these biases at work in these results.</p><p>I found one data study that prefers #4 as an explanation:</p><blockquote><p>The top-rated reason participants selected for leaving the relationship in Studies 1 and 2 was something missing from the relationship (i.e., lacking satisfaction or need fulfillment), in Study 3, the only significant positive predictor of breakup was involvement with alternative dating partners. (<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167220966903\">more</a>)</p></blockquote><p>In our book <em><a href=\"http://elephantinthebrain.com\">The Elephant in the Brain</a></em>, we argue that the job of our conscious minds is less to know why we really do things, and more to plausibly explain our actions in ways that protect us from accusations of norm violations. As a breakup offers many opportunities for norm violations, that theory predicts that we less know why we really break up, and more believe in and argue for stories that make us less at fault. That seems confirmed here.</p>"

Unlike so many other measures, this is an explicit measure of your R&amp;amp;D organization value as an investment relative to peer organizations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until recently, I assumed building this dataset required reading financial filings but my strategic finance partner at Carta, Tyler Braslow, pointed out that you can get all of this data for the tech section from &lt;a href=\"https://meritechanalytics.com/\"&gt;Meritech Analytics&lt;/a&gt;, for free.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://lethain.com/static/blog/2025/maritech-cover.png\" alt=\"The image shows a webpage for Meritech Analytics, which offers a public software benchmarking solution with features for analyzing SaaS company metrics.
