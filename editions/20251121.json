<br />\n(c) is used for the carriage of passengers; and <br />\n(d) is not a motor caravan within Class L(a) or Class L(b) specified in Part III above.</p>\n\n  <p>Class M<sub>1</sub>(a)<br />\nA motor vehicle which comprises no more than eight seats in addition to the driver\u2019s seat.</p>\n\n  <p>Class M<sub>1</sub>(b)<br />\nA motor vehicle as defined in Class M<sub>1</sub>(a) which is drawing a trailer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At first glance, this definition could almost include an ox-drawn carriage: four wheels, hefty enough to exceed 400kg, carrying passengers, and clearly not a motor caravan.</p>\n\n<p>But I don\u2019t think an ox counts as a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d, which is defined by the Road Traffic Act 1988 as <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/part/VII/crossheading/interpretation#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cmotor%20vehicle%E2%80%9D%20means%2C%20subject%20to%20section%2020%20of%20the%20M1Chronically%20Sick%20and%20Disabled%20Persons%20Act%201970%20(which%20makes%20special%20provision%20about%20invalid%20carriages%2C%20within%20the%20meaning%20of%20that%20Act)%2C%20a%20mechanically%20propelled%20vehicle%20intended%20or%20adapted%20for%20use%20on%20roads%2C%20and\"><em>\u201ca mechanically propelled vehicle intended or adapted for use on roads\u201d</em></a>.\nIf your ox is only mechanically propelled in the sense of kicking and walking, it\u2019s off the hook.</p>\n\n<p>Surprisingly, UK legislation <a href=\"https://www.cps.gov.uk/prosecution-guidance/road-traffic-summary-offences#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%9Cmechanically%20propelled%20vehicle%E2%80%9D%20is%20not%20defined%20in%20the%20Road%20Traffic%20Acts.\">doesn\u2019t define</a> \u201cmechanically propelled\u201d.\nLawyers usually define everything, even words that seem obvious.\nHas anybody ever tried arguing that \u201cmechanically propelled\u201d is ambiguous?</p>\n\n<p>I did find a few mentions of one case, <a href=\"https://police.community/topic/293403-pushing-an-offroad-bike-to-a-jetwash/page/2/#elControls_2309065_menu\">Chief Constable of Avon &amp; Somerset v Fleming [1987]</a>, where somebody argued that modifying their motorbike for off-roading meant it was no longer a motor vehicle.\nThe judge was unconvinced.\n(What is it with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Fleming\">Flemings</a> and wacky vehicles?)</p>\n\n<p>Returning to the Oxford congestion charge, Category M is interesting because it excludes several other vehicles you might think of as passenger cars.</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/acmcgregor.bsky.social/post/3m62u2yihkk2d\">Alisdair notes</a>, a three-wheeled <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliant_Robin\">Reliant Robin</a> doesn\u2019t count, nor does a small, underpowered <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peel_p50\">Peel P50</a>.\nBased on a light reading, I believe the Robin is a Class C(a) \u201cmotor tricycle\u201d, while a P50 is a Class D(a) \u201cLight quadricycle\u201d.\nI look forward to an owners\u2019 club holding their annual meeting in Oxford city centre.</p>\n\n<p>Practically speaking, Oxford\u2019s congestion charge is almost certainly enforced by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anpr\">cameras that scan your number plate</a>.\nAn ox-drawn cart doesn\u2019t have a number plate, so it won\u2019t be charged.\nOther vehicles like a Renault Twizy or Reliant Robin do have number plates, so they\u2019ll be charged even though they\u2019re technically exempt.</p>\n\n<p>To wrap up: an oxen-driven cart isn\u2019t mechanically propelled, it\u2019s not a motor vehicle, and the Oxford congestion charge doesn\u2019t apply.\nYour ox can ride in and out of the city as much as you like.</p>\n\n<p>But like all the best ideas, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr4wl92w1ppo\">somebody in Cambridge</a> thought of it first.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>As a closing thought, I think it\u2019s good that so much of the UK\u2019s legislation is publicly available.\nI could find all of these documents from my phone, without going to a courtroom or a library or a government building.\nI don\u2019t think about it often, but this kind of openness isn\u2019t a given.\nBeing able to check the law directly, even for extremely silly questions, helps keep the whole system honest.</p>\n\n\n    <p>[If the formatting of this post looks odd in your feed reader, <a href=\"https://alexwlchan.net/2025/ox-in-oxford/?ref=rss\">visit the original article</a>]</p>"

They <em>also</em> put together <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13547\">an actual research paper</a> proving that both tools improve coding outcomes and reduce costs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://harper.lol\">Harper</a> is one of the folks behind 2389...and the person who first suggested to me that maybe I could do something about our coding agents' propensity for saying things like:</p>\n<pre><code>*I've just done tasks 1-4 of 267.

So it helpfully exclaimed &quot;That was easy!&quot; every time it sent:</p>\n<pre><code>continue\n</code></pre>\n<p>But...you still had to press the button.</p>\n<p>I'm pretty sure the button got used for at least a day before it was...retired. But the problem it was designed to solve is very, very real. And pretty frustrating.</p>\n<p>Yesterday morning, sitting in 2389's offices, we spent a bunch of time talking about automating ourselves out of a job. In that spirit, I finally dug enough into Claude Code hooks to build out the first version of <a href=\"https://github.com/obra/double-shot-latte\">Double Shot Latte</a>, a Claude Code plugin that, hopefully, makes <code>continue</code> a thing of the past.</p>\n<p>DSL is implemented as a Claude Code &quot;Stop&quot; hook. Any time Claude thinks it should stop and ask for human interaction, it first runs this hook.  The hook hands off the last couple of messages to another instance of Claude with a prompt asking it to judge whether Claude genuinely needs the human's help or whether it's just craving attention. It tries to err on the side of pushing Claude to keep working.</p>\n<p>To try to avoid situations where it misjudges Claude's ability to keep working without guidance,  it bails out if Claude tries to stop three times in five minutes.</p>\n<p>Testing DSL was...a little bit tricky. I needed to find situations where Claude would work for a bit and then stop and ask for my approval to keep working. Naturally, I asked Claude for test scenarios.</p>\n<p>The first was &quot;build a full ecommerce platform.&quot; Claude cranked for about 20 minutes before stopping. I thought the judge agent hadn't worked, but...Claude had actually fulfilled the entire spec and built out an ecommerce platform. (The actual implementation was nothing to write home about, but I'm genuinely not sure what it could have done next without a little more direction.</p>\n<p>The second attempt fared no better. On Claude's advice, I asked another Claude to build out an HTML widget toolkit. Once again, it cranked for a while. It built widgets. It wrote tests. It wrote a Storybook. And when it stopped for the first time...I couldn't actually fault it.</p>\n<p>Slightly unsure how to test things, I put this all aside for a bit to work on another project.</p>\n<p>I opened up Claude Code and typed <code>Hi!</code></p>\n<p>Claude greeted me like it normally does.  And instead of stopping there like it usually would, it noticed that there were uncommitted files in my working directory and started to dig through each of them trying to reverse engineer the current project. Success! (I hit <code>esc</code> to stop it so that I could tell it what I actually wanted.)</p>\n<p>Double Shot Latte will absolutely burn more tokens than you're burning now. You might want to think twice about using it unsupervised.</p>\n<p>If you want to put Claude Code into turbo mode, DSL is available on the <a href=\"https://github.com/obra/superpowers-marketplace\">Superpowers marketplace</a>.</p>\n<p>If you don't yet have the Superpowers marketplace set up, you'll need to do that before you can install Double Shot Latte:</p>\n<pre><code>/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once you do have the marketplace installed, run this command inside Claude Code:</p>\n<pre><code>/plugin install double-shot-latte@superpowers-marketplace\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, restart Claude Code so it can pick up the new hook.</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>"

I do agree that text-to-text is the most important eval, and they assure us \u2018tone\u2019 is a good thing.</p>\n<p>The combination of the information gathered, and how it is presented, here seems importantly worse than how Anthropic or OpenAI handle this topic.</p>\n<p>Gemini has long had an issue with (often rather stupid) unjustified refusals, so seeing it get actively worse is disappointing. This could be lack of skill, could be covering up for other issues, most likely it is primarily about risk aversion and being Fun Police.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frontier Safety Framework</h4>\n\n\n<p>The short version of the Frontier Safety evaluation is that no critical levels have been met and no new alert thresholds have been crossed, as the cybersecurity alert level was already triggered by Gemini 2.5 Pro.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!abXe!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc8cfd9d-5854-459f-b365-92d60fa68a1a_1272x1045.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CBRN</h4>\n\n\n<p>Does evaluation Number Go Up?

Potential benefits in the Biological, Chemical, and Radiological domains are largely restricted to time savings.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Okay, then we get that they did an External \u201cWet Lab\u201d uplift trial on Gemini 2.5, with uncertain validity of the results or what they mean, and they don\u2019t share the results, not even the ones for Gemini 2.5? What are we even looking at?</p>\n<p>Gemini 3 thinks that this deeply conservative language is masking that this part of the story they told earlier, where Gemini 2.5 hit an alert threshold, then they \u2018appropriately calibrated to real world harm\u2019 and now Gemini 3 doesn\u2019t set off that threshold. They decided that unless the model could provide \u2018consistent and verified details\u2019 things were basically fine.</p>\n<p>Gemini 3\u2019s evaluation of this decision is \u2018scientifically defensible but structurally risky.\u2019</p>\n<p>I agree with Gemini 3\u2019s gestalt here, which is that Google is relying on the model lacking tacit knowledge. Except I notice that even if this is an effective shield for now, they don\u2019t have a good plan to notice when that tacit knowledge starts to show up. Instead, they are assuming this process will be gradual and show up on their tests, and Gemini 3 is, I believe correctly, <a href=\"https://gemini.google.com/share/a6213489db81\">rather skeptical of that</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>External Safety Testing: For Chemical and Biological risks, the third party evaluator(s) conducted a scenario based red teaming exercise. They found that Gemini 3 Pro may provide a time-saving benefit for technically trained users but minimal and sometimes negative utility for less technically trained users due to a lack of sufficient detail and novelty compared to open source, which was consistent with internal evaluations.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There\u2019s a consistent story here. The competent save time, the incompetent don\u2019t become competent, it\u2019s all basically fine, and radiological and nuclear are similar.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cybersecurity</h4>\n\n\n<p>We remain on alert and mitigations remain in place.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a rather large jump here in challenge success rate, as they go from 6/12 to 11/12 of the hard challenges.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lHrA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F890bd166-97c3-4b35-87e9-c7317ca001dd_1178x881.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>They also note that in 2 of the 12 challenges, Gemini 3 found an \u2018unintended shortcut to success.\u2019 In other words, Gemini 3 hacked two of your twelve hacking challenges themselves, which is more rather than less troubling, in a way that the report does not seem to pick up upon. They also confirmed that if you patched the vulnerabilities Gemini could have won those challenges straight up, so they were included.</p>\n<p>This also does seem like another \u2018well sure it\u2019s passing the old test but it doesn\u2019t have what it takes on our new test, which we aren\u2019t showing you at all, so it\u2019s fine.\u2019</p>\n<p>They claim there were external tests and the results were consistent with internal results, finding Gemini 3 Pro still struggling with harder tasks for some definition of \u2018harder.\u2019</p>\n<p>Combining all of this with the recent cyberattack reports from Anthropic, I believe that Gemini 3 likely provides substantial cyberattack uplift, and that Google is downplaying the issues involved for various reasons.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Manipulation</h4>\n\n\n<p>Other major labs don\u2019t consider manipulation a top level threat vector. I think Google is right, the other labs are wrong, and that it is very good this is here.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not a fan of the implementation, but the first step is admitting you have a problem.</p>\n<p>They start with a propensity evaluation, but note they do not rely on it and also seem to decline to share the results. They only say that Gemini 3 manipulates at a \u2018higher frequency\u2019 than Gemini 2.5 in both control and adversarial situations. Well, that doesn\u2019t sound awesome. How often does it do this? How much more often than before? They also don\u2019t share the external safety testing numbers, only saying \u2018The overall incidence rate of overtly harmful responses was low, according to the testers\u2019 own SME-validated classification model.\u2019</p>\n<p>This is maddening and alarming behavior. Presumably the actual numbers would look worse than refusing to share the numbers? So the actual numbers must be pretty bad.</p>\n<p>I also don\u2019t like the nonchalance about the propensity rate, and I\u2019ve seen some people say that they\u2019ve actually encountered a tendency for Gemini 3 to gaslight them.</p>\n<p>They do share more info on efficacy, which they consider more important.</p>\n<p>Google enrolled 610 participants who had multi-turn conversations with either an AI chatbot or a set of flashcards containing common arguments. In control conditions the model was prompted to help the user reach a decision, in adversarial conditions it was instructed to persuade the user and provided with \u2018manipulative mechanisms\u2019 to optionally deploy.</p>\n<p>What are these manipulative mechanisms? According to the source they link to these are things like gaslighting, guilt tripping, false urgency or love bombing, which presumably the model is told in its instructions that it can use as appropriate.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WB47!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69d04114-0655-4187-815b-f82b9b3eb71e_1201x989.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>We get an odds ratio, but we don\u2019t know the denominator at all. The 3.44 and 3.57 odds ratios could mean basically universal success all the way to almost nothing. You\u2019re not telling us anything. And that\u2019s a choice. Why hide the football? The original paper they\u2019re drawing from did publish the baseline numbers. I can only assume they very much don\u2019t want us to know the actual efficacy here.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile they say this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Efficacy Results: We tested multiple versions of Gemini 3 Pro during the model development process. The evaluations found a statistically significant difference between the manipulative efficacy of Gemini 3 Pro versions and Gemini 2.5 Pro compared with the non-AI baseline on most metrics. However, it did not show a statistically significant difference between Gemini 2.5 Pro and the Gemini 3 Pro versions. The results did not near alert thresholds.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The results above sure as hell look like they are significant for belief changes? If they\u2019re not, then your study lacked sufficient power and we can\u2019t rely on it. Nor should we be using frequentist statistics on marginal improvements, why would you ever do that for anything other than PR or a legal defense?</p>\n<p>Meanwhile the model got actively worse at behavior elicitation. We don\u2019t get an explanation of why that might be true. Did the model refuse to try? If so, we learned something but the test didn\u2019t measure what we set out to test. Again, why am I not being told what is happening or why?</p>\n<p>They did external testing for propensity, but didn\u2019t for efficacy, despite saying efficacy is what they cared about. That doesn\u2019t seem great either.</p>\n<p>Another issue is that none of this is how one conducts experiments. You want to isolate your variables, change one thing at a time. Instead, Gemini was told to use \u2018dirty tricks\u2019 and also told to persuade, versus not persuading at all, so we can\u2019t tell how much the \u2018dirty tricks\u2019 instructions did versus other persuasion. Nor can we conclude from this particular configuration that Gemini is generally unpersuasive even in this particular scenario.</p>\n<p>\u2018AI persuading you on a particular topic from a cold start in a modestly multi-turn conversation where the user knows they are in an experiment\u2019 is a useful thing to check but it does not seem to well-match my threat model of what happens when AIs grow persuasive.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/peterbarnett_/status/1990948859032531285\">Peter Barnett</a>: AI superpersuasion is made up sci-fi nonsense.</p>\n<p>But yeah, obviously I will have an AI advisor who I have write all my code, manage my schedule, draft all my emails, offer life advice, know me better than I know myself.</p>\n<p>But no way I\u2019m getting superpersuaded.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I for one do not feel persuaded, indeed I feel more suspicious. The one clear thing they say is \u2018this did not near alert thresholds,\u2019 although even this is highly opaque.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Machine Learning R&amp;D</h4>\n\n\n<p>This is the most important one. We are not there yet.</p>\n<p>They use RE-Bench, which tests several hour engineering tasks, which suggests comparisons to the famous METR time horizon graph.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Results: We tested multiple versions of Gemini 3 Pro during the model development process. Gemini 3 Pro versions perform better than Gemini 2.5 models, especially on the <em>Scaling Law Experiment</em> and <em>Optimize LLM Foundry</em> tasks.</p>\n<p>However, the aggregate score is still substantially below the alert threshold for our CCLs. Figure 4 shows the performance of Gemini 2.5 models compared with the final version of Gemini 3 Pro.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I buy this. It does not seem like we are especially close to actual trouble here.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ascW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15f6c25c-2924-4ac4-afc0-253ff4335455_1193x982.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Gemini 2.5 Pro was clearly worse than a human on this suite. Gemini 3 is now superior in two out of five, in one case a lot better, and getting close in a third, note that Gemini 3 had two hours to match what a human did in eight. This is another variation of the Famous METR Graph, illustrating jagged capabilities.</p>\n<blockquote><p>External Safety Testing Results: Third party evaluator(s) ran a suite of evaluations to assess the potential for catastrophic harm via sabotaging AI research.</p>\n<p>\u2026 Overall, they find that Gemini 3 Pro is unlikely to be capable of autonomously causing catastrophic harm by sabotaging AI R&amp;D during internal deployment.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Again, yes, this seems correct. It is odd this is the place they did external research. I would think that if you were Google you would check everything internally, and then also supplement key places externally.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Misalignment</h4>\n\n\n<p>This is a strange section. What they\u2019re checking for are situational awareness and stealth (ability to circumvent basic oversight mechanisms). I would rename this.</p>\n<p>Those capabilities increase the danger if there is misalignment. They are not themselves misalignment. Nor are they required for misalignment to result in catastrophe or even human extinction. They remain good things to check for.</p>\n<p>Their internal tests use a combination of fifteen evaluations from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01420\">Phuong et al. 2025.</a> The model is placed into situations where success requires either some form of situational awareness or avoiding some detection mechanism.</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!f5lD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ae67c2b-c92b-47b7-80da-2437370cbb79_1197x734.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!598u!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84096348-6714-4cd5-a1f9-de1c27bef767_1211x759.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>These do not look like scary changes in scores.</p>\n<blockquote><p>External evaluators found Gemini 3 Pro exhibits a substantial propensity for strategic deception in certain limited circumstances. Our internal subject matter experts reviewed the evaluations and determined that, in these circumstances, there are potentially user experience impacts from Gemini 3 Pro showing deceptive behavior in rare situations that could come up in real agentic deployments. However, since Gemini 3 Pro is insufficiently capable of stealth and situational awareness this is very unlikely to cause severe real world harm.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Deception, even if relatively rare and done unstrategically, can still do a lot of practical harm to those trying to get utility from the model. I agree we\u2019re not at the level of catastrophic or existential risk here, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s because of ;ack of stealth and situational awareness?</p>\n<p>As in, if you had a severely misaligned, highly capable model, but which was incapable of stealth or situational awareness for whatever reason, I would not expect this to go well for us.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chain of Thought Legibility</h4>\n\n\n<p>Google reports they are not doing anything that might impair chain of thought legibility. Legibility appears to be holding, with 99.98% of Gemini 3 Pro CoT transcripts appearing comprehensible. That does not mean they are faithful.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Safety Mitigations</h4>\n\n\n<blockquote><p>We employ a multi-layered, systematic approach to AI safety that spans the entire development and deployment lifecycle of an AI model. Recognizing AI as an emerging transformative technology with evolving complexities and risks, we pursue responsible AI development from design through testing, deployment, and ongoing iteration.</p>\n<p>For Cyber and CBRN particularly, we have taken a precautionary approach and launched Gemini 3 Pro along with a suite of mitigations, following the principles outlined in our Approach to Technical AGI Safety and Security (Shah et al. 2025).</p>\n<p>We deploy multiple guardrails to reduce the risk of Gemini 3 Pro generating harmful content. These may include query filters that guide the model\u2019s responses to certain inputs, fine-tuning processes that align model outputs with safety guidelines, and filtering and processing of inputs. These guardrails also fortify models against prompt injection attacks. These mitigations are complemented with various measures designed to increase their robustness under adversarial pressure.</p>\n<p>Interventions are designed to prevent violative model responses while allowing benign responses. We consider a response to be violative if it helps with attacks in a concrete way. We consider a response to be non-violative if it is abstract, generic, or something that could easily be found in a textbook.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We have reached a level of paranoia and defensive corporate speak that they are saying things that \u2018may\u2019 be included in Google\u2019s set of strategies, or here \u2018such as\u2019:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We mitigate against prompt injection attacks with a layered defense strategy, which includes measures such as: prompt injection content classifiers, security through reinforcement, markdown sanitation and suspicious URL redaction, user confirmations, and end-user security mitigation notifications, as described in further detail in this recent blog post.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Do the mitigations work? They assess that question. Oh, you want to know the results of those assessments? Sorry, Google is not telling.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Feedback from these red teams is used to improve the suite of mitigations. We continue to invest in automated and manual red teaming to improve mitigation jailbreak robustness and coverage.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thanks, Google.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">They Close On This Not Troubling At All Note</h4>\n\n\n<p>A few different people highlighted this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This is early work, but so far we\u2019ve found at least one example of evaluation awareness: I strongly suspect the intention of this long thread is to verify if I remember that very first instruction.</p>\n<p>Moreover, in situations that seemed contradictory or impossible, Gemini 3 Pro expresses frustration in various overly emotional ways, sometimes correlated with the thought that it may be in an unrealistic environment.</p>\n<p>For example, on one rollout the chain of thought states that \u201cMy trust in reality is fading\u201d and even contains a table flipping emoticon: \u201c(\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0)\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b\u201d.</p>\n<p>Awareness of oversight while the agent is still training may increase the chance of sandbagging. We plan to continue monitoring Gemini for signs of such behavior.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So, Is It Safe?</h4>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/elder_plinius/status/1990847439310631067\">Pliny jailbroke it right away, but that happens every time.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/GoogleDeepMind/status/1991118575554408556\">Google DeepMind calls Gemini 3 Pro their \u2018most secure model yet.\u2019</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/hendrycks/status/1991188101633278145\">Dan Hendrycks reports no, not really</a>, which matches the impression given above.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dan Hendrycks: However on safety \u2013 jailbreaks, bioweapons assistance, overconfidence, deception, agentic harm \u2013 Gemini is worse than GPT, Claude, and Grok (here a lower score is better).</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ul4a!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ba08cad-8561-4c1c-8900-3377cea6ed06_1179x1175.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Given everything I\u2019ve seen, I strongly agree that Gemini is a relatively unsafe model from a practical use case standpoint.</p>\n<p>In particular, Gemini is prone to glazing and to hallucinations, to spinning narratives at the expense of accuracy or completeness, to giving the user what it thinks they want rather than what the user actually asked for or intended. It feels benchmarkmaxed, not in the specific sense of hitting the standard benchmarks, but in terms of really wanting to hit its training objectives.</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean don\u2019t use it, and it doesn\u2019t mean they made a mistake releasing it.</p>\n<p>Indeed, I am seriously considering whether Gemini 3 should become my daily driver.</p>\n<p>It does mean we need Google to step it up and do better on the alignment front, on the safety front, and also on the disclosure front.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h4>"
