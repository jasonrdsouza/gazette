My journey started out with a Minisforum UM870, which is a lovely machine, but since then, I've come to really appreciate the work of <a href=\"https://www.bee-link.com/\">Beelink</a>.&nbsp;<br /><br /></div><div>In a <a href=\"https://www.gmktec.com/\">crowded</a> <a href=\"https://www.minisforum.com/\">market</a> <a href=\"https://www.geekompc.com/\">for</a> <a href=\"https://www.asus.com/us/displays-desktops/nucs/all-series/\">mini</a> <a href=\"https://us-store.msi.com/cubi-series\">PCs</a>, Beelink stands out with their superior build quality, their class-leading cooling and silent operation, and their use of fully Linux-compatible components (the UM870 shipped with a MediaTek bluetooth/wifi card that doesn't work with Linux!). It's the complete package at three super compelling price points.<br /><br /></div><div>For $289, <a href=\"https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-eqr5?variant=46994723242226\">you can get the EQR5</a>, which runs an 8-core AMD Zen3 5825U that puts out 1723/6419 in Geekbench, and comes with 16GB RAM and 500GB NVMe. I've run <a href=\"https://omarchy.org/\">Omarchy</a> on it, and it flies. For me, the main drawback was the lack of a DisplayPort, which kept me from using it with an Apple display, and the fact that the SER8 exists. But if you're on a budget, and you're fine with HDMI only, it's a wild bargain.<br /><br /></div><div>For $499, <a href=\"https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-ser8-8745hs?variant=46991244722418\">you can get the SER8</a>. That's the price-to-performance sweet spot in the range. It uses the excellent 8-core AMD Zen4 8745HS that puts out 2595/12985 in Geekbench (~M4 multi-core numbers!), and runs our HEY test suite with 30,000 assertions almost as fast as an M4 Max! At that price, you get 32GB RAM + 1TB NVMe, as well as a DisplayPort, so <a href=\"https://manuals.omamix.org/3/omacom/75/apple-displays-on-linux\">it works</a> with both the Apple 5K Studio Display and the Apple 6K XDR Display (you just need <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BNX7MS6N\">the right cable</a>). Main drawback is limited wifi/bluetooth range, but Beelink tells me there's a fix on the way for that.<br /><br /></div><div>For $929, <a href=\"https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-ser9-ai-9-hx-370\">you can get the SER9 HX370</a>. This is the top dog in this form factor. It uses the incredible 12-core AMD Zen5 HX370 that hits 2990/15611 in Geekbench, and runs our HEY test suite faster than any Apple M chip I've ever tested. The built-in graphics are also very capable. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpsWijbj4U&amp;t=7m10s\">Enough to play a ton of games at 1080p</a>. It also sorted the SER8's current wifi/bluetooth range issue.<br /><br /></div><div>I ran the SER8 as my main computer for a while, but now I'm using the SER9, and I just about never feel like I need anything more. Yes, the Framework Desktop, with its insane AMD Max 395+ chip, is even more bonkers. It almost cuts the HEY test suite time in half(!), but it's also $1,795, and not yet generally available. (But <a href=\"https://frame.work/desktop\">preorders are open</a> for the ballers!).<br /><br /></div><div>Whichever machine fits your budget, it's frankly incredible that we have this kind of performance and efficiency available at these prices with all of these Beelinks drawing less than 10 watt at idle and no more than 100 watt at peak!<br /><br /></div><div>So it's no wonder that Beelink has been <a href=\"https://x.com/rsstafford/status/1946625692684243202\">selling</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/mitchellh/status/1943737627087450141\">these</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/matsonj/status/1947844912139145448\">units</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/codejake/status/1944972888161026425\">like</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/mani_bono/status/1940881681382244426\">hotcakes</a> since I <a href=\"https://x.com/dhh/status/1935500668992921731\">started</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/dhh/status/1941891417057685754\">talking</a> about them on X as the ideal, cheap <a href=\"https://omarchy.org\">Omarchy</a> desktop computers. It's such a symbiotic relationship. There are a ton of programmers who have become Linux curious, and Beelink offers no-brainer options to give that a try at a bargain.<br /><br /></div><div>I just love when that happens. The perfect intersection of hardware, software, and timing. That's what we got here. It's a Beelink, baby!<br /><br />(And no, before you ask, I don't get any royalties, there's no affiliate link, and I don't own any shares in Beelink.

That won&#8217;t happen. OK, an easy one:  Is it going to take away all our jobs? Probably.</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Thanks for reading Margins by Ranjan Roy and Can Duruk!

The real questions are much more boring&#8212;and much more important. Questions like who's going to control the models we use, whether we'll ever stop relying on a handful of companies, and why some models are just... better, despite all logic suggesting they shouldn't be.</p><p>So, today, I want to pose a few of them and see what kind of answers I can come up with.</p><h2>Open vs. Closed: Who Controls the Future?</h2><p><strong>Let's start with a simple one: open or closed? </strong>Here&#8217;s another way to put it. Do we expect companies like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and a few others to always maintain an edge? Or do we expect open&#8209;weight (i.e., open&#8209;source) models to ever catch up to frontier models from private companies? </p><p>This has big implications. Are we forever going to rely on third parties, or at some point do we get to deploy these on-premises on our (cloud) servers? Or is it going to be like databases, where Oracle serves a few big customers and everyone else uses open-source software?</p><p>On the closed side, we don't really have much evidence, except for the most compelling one: past performance. Take coding models, for example. While models like Qwen are always impressive, when it comes to mind&#8209;share and pure developer productivity, most people are still using models from Anthropic (Claude) or Google (Gemini). Even Facebook, which has made a big show of keeping its models open, has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-anthropic-ai-llama-coding-efficiency-2025-6#:~:text=Meta%20rolled%20out%20Devmate%2C%20a,gather%20feedback%20as%20we%20go.%22\">recently switched</a> to Claude.</p><p>The \"open\" side, however, has history on its side. At some level, all LLMs are a bunch of data and code. There's no magic, and eventually people figure out your tricks. You can even see OpenAI thinking this way too; why else would it be ramping up their own <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-takes-page-palantir-doubles-consulting-services\">consulting arm</a> deploying their models in enterprises?</p><p>Even the most advanced models would fit on a thumb&#8209;drive, and even if you did not have access to that drive, you can extract much of the magic sauce remotely, like Deepseek allegedly did. Why do you need OpenAI's models if you can get 90&#8239; % of the way there with an Accenture contract?</p><h2>Why Are Some Models Just... Better?\"</h2><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tRcE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0144a76f-3860-4f7f-b0e2-7e4875d7799e_1344x896.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"896\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tRcE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0144a76f-3860-4f7f-b0e2-7e4875d7799e_1344x896.jpeg\" width=\"1344\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">via <a href=\"https://x.com/gizakdag\">Gizem Akdag</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Yet, this question raises another question: <strong>why are the closed models still so far ahead of other models</strong>? Or, even a narrower question: <strong>why do Anthropic models seem to be significantly better than models from companies with access to larger datasets and more GPUs</strong>?</p><p>The answer seems to be that we don't really know what makes one model &#8220;better&#8221; than another. There are so many benchmarks that every model developer picks the one they rank the best in when they announce their model&#8217;s supremacy. While many developers I talk to prefer Anthropic models, there are <a href=\"https://antirez.com/news/154\">many others</a> who prefer Gemini. I think Claude Opus (from Anthropic) is the best writer, but it could also be that I don't have access to o3&#8209;pro just yet. And I didn't even talk about Grok at all yet.</p><p>The other part is that these are such cutting&#8209;edge technologies that the talent really matters; you can get materially different models if you have the right people on staff. Zuckerberg's $100&#8239;M+ offers sound a lot less crazy once you realize those same people&#8212;and not much else&#8212;made OpenAI worth hundreds of billions. I mean, they said it <a href=\"https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1727236805182026159\">themselves</a> just a few months ago.</p><h2>Should We Even Care About Safety?\"</h2><p>This brings me to another question: <strong>should companies act with safety in mind when developing and releasing these models</strong>? Or is it at best a way to keep some trust&#8209;and&#8209;safety&#8209;minded people busy and generate good press, and at worst, a way to build some regulatory barriers for new entrants?</p><p>I generally think companies should act responsibly and should try to put the well&#8209;being of humanity somewhere in their spreadsheets. But I am also aware that most companies will do whatever makes sense for their shareholders as they wont to do, and it's the job of regulators to make sure the negative externalities are folded into those models. </p><p>For example, Grok&#8212;the brainchild of Elon Musk&#8212;released its models with practically zero safety precautions, to exactly no one's surprise, drawing the ire of <a href=\"https://x.com/saprmarks/status/1944455357629333938\">many</a> in the <a href=\"https://x.com/boazbaraktcs/status/1945165577154175288\">industry</a>.</p><p>Yet, I've not seen a lot of people care about the safety of these models when they are deploying them in their enterprises. They care about cost, of course, and care quite a bit about how these models use their companies' data.</p><h2>Should We Sell AI Chips to China?</h2><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Zl25!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf30f6d7-3707-4391-a384-b432c03b2bbd_1344x896.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"896\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Zl25!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf30f6d7-3707-4391-a384-b432c03b2bbd_1344x896.jpeg\" width=\"1344\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">via <a href=\"https://x.com/gizakdag\">Gizem Akdag</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Speaking of safety, yet another question: <strong>should we be selling our most advanced AI chips to China for training and inference</strong>?</p><p>The knee&#8209;jerk answer seems to be no.

We need to play both the long and the short game. The short game is the talent, and the long game is the supply chain resilience.</p><p>The short game is obvious. The long game, less so. But here&#8217;s an anecdote. An Apple executive once told me that the Bush administration once kindly asked them to start buying precision glass lenses from US suppliers so they'd keep their spy&#8209;satellite building pipelines and the talent supply intact. Turns out both the people who know how to make them and the machines take years to develop. What happens when (if?) run out of people who know how to design chips from scratch? Has our Boeing experience not taught us well?</p><h2>The Boring Futures We Can't Predict</h2><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vaNG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68235568-e179-47dc-87a5-f68e91fa0f73_1344x896.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"896\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vaNG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68235568-e179-47dc-87a5-f68e91fa0f73_1344x896.jpeg\" width=\"1344\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">via <a href=\"https://x.com/gizakdag\">Gizem Akdag</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>While it's fun to consider doomsday or post&#8209;scarcity scenarios, the future is probably going to be <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/02/why-i-think-ai-take-off-is-relatively-slow.html\">more boring</a> than we expect in the short term and more unpredictable in the long term.</p><p>We first feared mass unemployment from steam engines, then electricity, but no one thought air&#8209;conditioning&#8212;a boring technology made possible by electricity&#8212;would upend entire countries' industries.
